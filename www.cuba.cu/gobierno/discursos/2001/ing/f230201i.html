<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Speech given by
Dr. Fidel Castro Ruz, President of the Republic of Cuba, at the
celebration of the 40</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b> anniversary of
INDER and the dedication of the International School of Physical
Education and Sports, on February 23, 2001.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Do not get your hopes up; I am not going to
make a long speech (LAUGHTER AND SHOUTS).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Distinguished guests:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Dear students:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have a problem, because we are here today
to celebrate two things: the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of INDER
[the National Institute of Sports, Physical Education and
Recreation] (APPLAUSE), and the dedication of the International
School of Physical Education and Sports (SHOUTS). What should I
do? What should I talk about? And this has come about purely by
chance; the school was not dedicated two or three months ago
because there was no time to do it. Now it has come to coincide
with this anniversary, and in my view, the two things are very
important.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There is a lot that could be said about
INDER and its 40 years history. Some of our comrades here have
recalled part of that history. Humberto also mentioned a few
things related to INDER, but it would have been best to separate
the two events: the anniversary of INDER and the inauguration of
the School.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I would prefer not to talk too much about
our sports history. At the exhibition hall, where four of the
school&#146;s best students awaited us &#150;a Mozambican girl, a
Haitian girl, a Venezuelan boy, and a Bolivian girl, who said she
was a swimmer&#150; when I saw all those photographs of our
excellent athletes, of some of the glorious moments in
revolutionary sports, I thought about this and wondered, why so
many photographs? Is this a glorification of Cuban sports, a
chauvinistic display? Are we not perhaps humiliating the
athletes, or young people, or students from other countries by
extolling Cuba&#146;s victories? The problem was that I had
forgotten for a moment that we were also celebrating INDER&#146;s
40<sup>th</sup> anniversary. Now I realize why they put up so
many photographs of Cuban athletes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We have made advances and achieved a great
deal of success. Do we feel proud? No, not yet. Do we feel
satisfied? No, we will never be totally satisfied.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Nevertheless, I was fully aware at all
times that this was a great day, because if we have done well in
sports, if we have a worthy history in sports, it is precisely
because we have accumulated the experience and prestige necessary
to establish this International School of Physical Education and
Sports.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Yes, looking at this school you can feel a
sense of satisfaction. Can you feel a sense of pride? No. Let us
simply say that we are convinced and confident that a great many
things can still be done in the future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If there is one thing to regret, it is the
fact that the school seems small in terms of the number of
students that it can accommodate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I had been pushing for eventually reaching
a total enrollment of 2000, because it is a five-year program,
and that way there could be a larger number of new students every
year, 450 or 500. But when I saw the scale model in a small room
by the entrance, I realized that we could not expand enrollment
that much.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I had an idea about this school. I knew
this location, because I had come here many times. I had toured
this whole area, even farther beyond, on the other side of the
hills, when we were developing genetic research centers for
cattle. That is why there are so many dairy farms nearby.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Years ago, many years ago, there was a
small sugar mill on this spot. I think it was called Portugalete.
There was no sugar cane left in the area. I remember reading
about the campaign led by Máximo Gómez in the province of
Havana, and when Maceo was marching towards Pinar del Rio, he
passed through this area. The name of the sugar mill comes up in
the accounts of that heroic war. You can see how relatively close
the <b>mambises</b> (independence<b> </b>fighters)<b> </b>were to
the capital.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Gómez achieved great feats and carried out
highly daring military operations. When Maceo was returning from
Pinar del Rio, there was a very important battle fought near
here, in the province of Havana, before reaching the town of
Madruga, where both Maceo and Gómez took part. All these places
are full of history. And then, in the major effort to reinforce
the defense of our country, there was a need some day to build a
school here, along with other military facilities, such as
workshops for optical equipment used by the artillery. There was
even a communications and chemical defense school. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The years passed, times grew difficult,
many of the concepts related to defense changed, and as a result,
the army regular forces were reduced thus some major facilities
were left idle. This was one of them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">And what a coincidence, that it was
precisely in a former army facility that the international
medical school was established. In that case, it was a large
naval academy, used to train personnel for the merchant marine
and fishing fleet as well as for the Navy, and not only officers,
but also navigational equipment technicians. The academy was
freed up when these personnel began to be trained in other,
smaller schools, and thanks to the excellent condition in which
these facilities were maintained, it was possible to use them for
an international medical school. This event coincided with two
hurricanes. One of them wiped out the Dominican Republic and hit
Haiti very hard. It lost some of its force while passing over the
high mountain range that separates Haiti from the Dominican
Republic and arrived in Cuba somewhat dispersed, but it
reorganized, although with less force, and passed through almost
half of our island. It was advancing like a car or a truck along
the Central Highway, until twisting away to the north. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A few weeks later, maybe four weeks, a much
more powerful hurricane passed a certain distance south of our
coasts, with extremely high winds, and hit Central America
through Honduras. That was Hurricane Mitch, which claimed tens of
thousands of victims and caused enormous destruction. The young
Hondurans here, who shared their culture and dances with us, must
know very well how terrible this hurricane was, and how much
damage it caused. And not only there, but also in Guatemala,
Nicaragua, and El Salvador, to a greater or lesser extent. The
first three countries I mentioned were the hardest hit. This led
to the idea of sending a contingent of doctors to Central America
to try to save as many lives in this area every year as the
number lost to the hurricane. This was how our offer to send 2000
doctors to Central America originated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We had not forgotten about Haiti or the
Dominican Republic; we offered them our cooperation as well. A
doctors&#146; brigade was sent to the Dominican Republic, and
another much larger was then sent to Haiti, where it still
remains.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We were proposing long-term, comprehensive
health care programs, instead of merely doing what many others
do, which is to send a small emergency medical team for 10 or 15
days. We were offering programs that would last for years,
comprehensive health care programs, based on the figures we had
on infant mortality during the first year of life and from 0 to 5
years of age, which are rather high.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When we claimed that we could save as many
lives every year as those that had been lost in that disaster, we
were basing our claim on solid foundations. It has now been
demonstrated that during the first year of work, in some of the
areas where our doctors were stationed, the infant mortality rate
was reduced from 42 deaths per 1000 live births to 16.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">But we were thinking more about the future
than about that particular point in time, and that is what led to
the idea of the Latin American School of Medical Sciences, for
young people from Latin America (APPLAUSE), or in this case,
Central America. We had offered 500 scholarships, but the demand
was so great that we had to grant over 1000 scholarships for
medical students from Central America.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It is not that there is a shortage of
doctors in the countries of Latin American countries; you could
actually say that there is a surplus. But the practice of
medicine has become extraordinarily commercialized throughout the
world, as has sports. As a consequence, all the doctors tend to
be concentrated in the capitals and big cities. There are no
doctors for the small towns and villages, much less for the rural
areas, and even less for the mountainous regions where there are
poisonous snakes --something unheard of in our country-- and
dangerous insects. In some cases there are even wild cats. And of
course, one has to walk for hours or even days to get to these
places, where there is no electricity, or anything of the kind.
If it is at a very high altitude, it can also be very cold. And
at times there are great numbers of mosquitoes. All of this can
make the work of a doctor a true act of heroism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You may be wondering why I am talking about
the Latin American School of Medical Sciences, which was founded
with the purpose of training doctors based on a new concept of
true humanism and solidarity. Together with education, medicine
is perhaps one of the greatest and most noble of professions. Yet
it is sad to see what is happening practically everywhere, and it
is not that they are bad doctors because there are some very well
trained doctors. It is not a lack of goodness, but rather, the
fact that money and purely economic and material interests tend
to overshadow those sentiments, which are indispensable in all
professions, we could say, but fundamentally in the medical and
teaching professions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Engineers can stay in the cities,
industrial engineers, civil engineers, and specialists in the
building of bridges or large installations. There is no need for
engineers or architects in the mountains, in the countryside, in
small villages. There may be a need for agronomists, but not for
researchers or scientists, unless they are going there to gather
samples or conduct tests. But in the countryside, in the
mountains, in the most remote places and the smallest villages,
it is crucial to have both doctors and teachers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Teaching is still a more humble profession,
and there is a tradition of teachers working in the countryside.
Medicine is a higher status profession, since doctors are
University graduates, and this has not always been the case with
teachers. Today, the vast majority of our teachers are University
graduates, and we have quite a number of university-level teacher
training schools for both the primary and secondary school
levels.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At the time of the triumph of the
Revolution, there were no doctors prepared to march off to the
countryside, nor teachers for the mountains and remote places; on
the other hand, there were 10,000 unemployed teachers in the
cities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When the Revolution triumphed, the United
States opened its doors to all of the doctors who wanted to leave
Cuba, and of the 6000 in the country at the time, only 3000
stayed. They also took over half of the professors from our
medical schools. They took professors from other university
departments, too, as well as teachers from the small number of
senior high schools, middle schools and junior high schools in
the country at the time. I am not referring to technical schools,
because there were very few technical schools in our country in
those days. I do remember a certain kind of middle school from
those days, the so-called home economics schools. Today we might
ask ourselves what these home economics schools were. Were they
perhaps schools for housewives? Were they perhaps schools for
girls who would fulfill no other duty than that of taking care of
their husbands and children?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The education system in our country was
very poor at that time. Today there are more university graduates
in Cuba than there were sixth-grade graduates at the time of the
triumph of the Revolution. And one can only imagine what kind of
sixth-grade education they received given the disastrous
condition of our public schools in those days.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Today our country has a very good education
system. But I could also add that, in spite of this, we are still
not fully satisfied, even though our primary school students,
children the same age as the ones who were here doing gymnastic
exercises for us, score almost twice as high in tests as the
average unfortunately achieved by children in the rest of Latin
America.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Education is enormously important because
it is the basis for everything else and the considerations I have
described are what led to the founding of the Latin American
School of Medical Sciences. It became Latin American because of
the requests for scholarships received from other countries. The
school had a large capacity and when over 2000 students entered
the second year, it had already become a Latin American School.
This year, this semester, total enrollment should reach around
5000 students but we have room for them there. There is also
another school of basic sciences in the area where students will
do the first two years. This is following an initial semester
used for upgrading and preparing students so that they all have
the basic knowledge required for these first two years, which are
usually the two most difficult for any medical student. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Not all senior high schools in the region
are the same, some are better. That is the reason for these six
months of premed. But as part of our medical training methods,
from the very first year of medical school, students begin to
have contact with hospital facilities. In this case, during the
first and second years, they go to polyclinics and family doctor
offices, where they learn how to write up charts and files and
acquire a series of practical skills as part of their training.
During the last four years, they go to medical schools near major
hospitals, either in the country&#146;s capital, or provincial
capitals, or other large cities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Based on this experience, the idea came up
of to open an international sports school, when we learned that
these facilities were available. They had not been used as a
school and training center for defense personnel for many years,
but they had been well cared for and maintained despite the fact
that they had not been used for so long. It seemed like the ideal
place, because it had plenty of space, buildings, classrooms,
workshops, and warehouses. All that was needed was a few repairs,
a few changes so that it could be used as a school. They also
needed to prepare playing fields and ensure that there was
sufficient student housing for the first classes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When the school began operating in
September, there were around 400 students, because not all of the
countries that received the scholarships were able to send
students. A number of scholarships had been offered to 43
countries of Africa, but many of them have so few resources that
not all of them could send students and benefit from the
scholarships offered. Naturally, there could not be many
scholarships, because these countries are very far away, and the
students would be separated from their families for a much longer
period. It is not the same as in our region, where there are
countries, like Haiti or the Dominican Republic, that are very
close, or Mexico and Central America and the northern part of
South America. We have a lot more ties with the sports
institutions of Latin American countries; these countries have
more sports facilities, greater development in sports, and even a
greater need for physical education and sports instructors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">That was how the scholarships were
distributed. But the we realized that there was additional room,
and we thought it would be worthwhile using it. It was at this
point, and given the relations already existing and the
cooperation developing between Cuba and Venezuela in the field of
sports, that we said: These spaces that will not be filled this
year should be used, because if 200 more students were enrolled,
there would still be 400 spaces left for the next course, and so
we offered 200 scholarships to young people from Venezuela. That
is why almost a third of the students are Venezuelan. All the
Venezuelans, please, raise your hands. (SHOUTS.) As you can see,
it looks like a forest of hands. (APPLAUSE.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Of course, in principle, the scholarships
available should be used based on ratios and quotas. The
situation this year was an exception, because there was space not
being used. We will have to carefully study the distribution of
scholarships for the next intake.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You should keep in mind that for a small
country like Honduras, for example, or El Salvador, 10 students
mean more for the future development of sports there than 150
Brazilians. With a population of 160 million, 100 scholarships
for Brazil would fall far from helping to solve any problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Actually, when it comes to a big country,
more than that country needing scholarships to a school like
this, it is the school that needs a given number of Brazilian
students, based on the principle that every country in the
hemisphere should be represented. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Mexico has 100 million people, and so 10 or
15 scholarships are nothing for Mexico. But it is essential to
have 15 Mexican students, or a certain number of Mexican
students, so that Mexico is represented here. This is because
these schools&#146; mission is not only training physical
education and sports teachers but, perhaps above all else, it is
their mission to bring together the countries of Latin America
and the Caribbean, and developing a network of optimally trained
sports professionals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">These professionals will be able to
communicate with each other in the future and help to form a
powerful sports movement among nations that have been called upon
to unite. More than called upon to unite, they need it badly if
they want to preserve their identity, their culture, their
independence, and their hopes of one day constituting one big
nation, something that the great founding fathers dreamed of in
the early 19<sup>th</sup> century. It would be a great community
of nations that speak the same language, and have similar habits,
similar religious beliefs, that is, much more in common
culturally than the highly dissimilar countries of Europe, which
have practically erased the borders separating them, after
centuries of warring among themselves. They are now seeking to
establish a common currency, and are uniting because, given the
current world order in the world today, no small country alone
has any possibility to survive and develop.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We are not talking about science here, we
are talking about sports, looking to the horizon and into the
future. We are talking about training specialists in accordance
with a truly humanist doctrine, just as those medical students
are being trained. We will have to fight against the vile and
vulgar commercialization of sports.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">While it is tragic to turn health care into
a form of merchandise, it is also tragic to turn something as
noble as sports and physical exercise, something so closely
related to human health and wellbeing, into some kind of
merchandise. Today, Cuba is practically struggling alone against
the repugnant commercialism that has invaded sports, in which
there is no longer any such thing as amateur athletes, even in
the Olympics. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We know very well what the Olympics are all
about. Many countries that have not bothered to cultivate sports
devote themselves to buying athletes, athletes from countries
that have neither sports facilities, nor trainers and who often
have no choice but to pursue this route of professional sports
and commercialization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At least we have the honor, over and above
the honor of the medals we have won fair and square, and
sometimes against the biased judges of the mafias created in
certain sports &#150;all of these gold, silver and bronze medals,
or the top places occupied by our country, which have made it the
country that has won the greatest number of gold medals per
capita of all the countries in the world&#150; more than the
honor of having won these medals fair and square, I repeat, we
have the honor of not having won a single medal, of any color,
with athletes stolen from other countries. Throughout 42 years of
revolutionary struggle, and the 40 years since our sports
institution was founded, all of the medals we have won have been
won with athletes born and trained in our country throughout the
years. We have waged a lengthy and tireless battle to create a
sports culture, to create a sports movement like we have today,
devoting attention and resources to training instructors and
building facilities. This is what has allowed our country to
reach a place of honor in sports that no one can deny, and that
is now recognized by the entire world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There are three things that our country is
universally recognized for. One of them is its development in the
field of education, and I am mentioning this first because
general education comes before anything else. It began with the
literacy campaign carried out to benefit the large percentage of
citizens who did not know how to read and write. We then went on
to ensure that everyone had a sixth-grade education, then
ninth-grade, then senior high school level. Now all children and
teenagers are guaranteed primary, secondary and senior high
school education, and many of them go on to study in the dozens
of higher education centers also created by the Revolution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">That is why our country is recognized as
occupying an outstanding place in the world in the field of
education, just as we are recognized as occupying a place of
honor in terms of public health care and sports.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have mentioned three fields, and it would
be difficult to find three more humanistic fields, namely
education, health care and sports (APPLAUSE), whose services are
provided to all our children and all our citizens absolutely free
of charge (APPLAUSE).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">These are not the only activities developed
by our people over these years. There are also culture and
literature, for example, which are now advancing faster than ever
before. Science has not been forgotten. Scientists are essential
and cooperate with education. There can be no highly developed
education or medicine, or even well developed sports, without the
support of science.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Our people&#146;s efforts have been
directed not only at overcoming social injustice, not only at
eradicating extreme poverty, and while doing this we have had to
endure 42 years of a blockade because the empire does not punish
politicians embezzling thousands of dollars in many parts of the
world &#150; I do not want to mention any names because, among
other things, it is highly unlikely that there are any exceptions
among the head honchos of politics. The empire does not speak out
against injustice, crime, children begging in the streets, or
beggars sleeping under bridges or in doorways. It does not speak
out against hunger. It does not speak out against death squads,
it does not speak out against corruption, and it does not speak
out against those systems or those governments where the rates of
poverty and illiteracy are mind-boggling.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It did not speak out against apartheid; it
invested in and traded with it. It even knew about and tolerated
the fact that the racist and fascist South African regime had
acquired nuclear weapons, hoping that they would be used against
the Cuban internationalist combatants fighting the racist and
fascist South African raids into southern Angola.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It does speak out against Cuba. I know that
there are some diplomats here because I heard them mentioned. It
is incredible to see the shamelessness that abounds in this world
and the sad a role some governments play, that is, some members
of the international community and the governments that brazenly
speak out against Cuba at the Commission on Human Rights. Cuba, a
country where there has never been a vanished person, a political
assassination o anyone tortured. Never mind the thousands of
times that liars and slanderers have claimed that people are
tortured here. They can stand before a hundred thousand, half a
million Cubans and ask them if any of them has ever heard of
anyone tortured in our country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I wonder if any other country in the world
has been so devoted to humankind, to educating its people. And
now we have reached a higher stage, we are moving towards a
comprehensive, multifaceted education which encompasses, among
others, some things that many developed countries lack; because
being rich does not mean being educated, as being developed does
not mean being educated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There is a great deal of shamelessness in
international politics. I hope they do not think that we are
scared by their miserable maneuvers in Geneva! They do not know
how much we laugh at their ridiculous behavior, because it is
there that the low ethics, the low sense of morale and the
precarious dignity of some governments which behave like Mafiosi
--under the pressure, the tutelage and the orders of our powerful
neighbor to the north, the only superpower that rules in the
world today-- is put to the test.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Cuba stands here as an example, to the
shame of those who kowtow! (Applause). Cuba, a small country just
a few miles distant from that empire, a country which has had the
courage, the sense of honor, the dignity and the determination to
endure 42 years of blockade and 10 years of special period to
reach this millennium more united than ever, stronger than ever,
and with a greater capacity than ever for solidarity, a greater
capacity than ever to share what we have, with more human capital
than anyone (APPLAUSE).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Our neighbor to the north would not be able
to send 2,000 doctors to those places in Central America where
our doctors go. I said 2,000 and that is certainly an
overstatement. It remains to be seen if they could send 1,000,
not for a week or 15 days, but for a year, two years or three
years, providing services to Third World countries, those that
were colonies, those that for centuries were plundered by those
who today claim to be civilized and educated, by those who claim
to be champions of justice. What they in fact lack is a political
consciousness, the kind of conscience that our people are
increasingly acquiring in order not to be deceived or enticed,
much less demoralized.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Now there are some people talking about
so-called common Latin American positions. Yes, there should be a
dignified, honorable, courageous, independent common position,
and that would not mean shamefully supporting the empire, but
rather opposing the empire&#146;s loathsome maneuvers against a
country that has written a page in history that will be extremely
difficult to ignore or write off. (Applause) And the more the
empire and its acolytes insist on carrying on with this loathsome
behavior, the stronger will be Cuba&#146;s commitment and its
determination to struggle. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Actually, it is incredible that at this
same Commission on Human Rights where they will discuss and vote
the Yankee resolution or that of the miserable lackeys who
propose it in their name, or their allies who are there to
support it, --since the empire does not forgive being refused
anything when it comes to Cuba-- an overwhelming majority also
vote in favor of numerous resolutions presented by Cuba.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Cuba is the country that puts forward the
most resolutions in favor of human rights, and the overwhelming
majority supports these resolutions, because opposing them would
be going too far. So, the United States is left all alone, or
with three or four or more of its partners in exploiting the
world. But, sometimes these are no more than 10 or 15 while
Cuba&#146;s resolutions always obtain 30, 35, 40 or even more
votes. That is how this world operates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Today&#146;s world is plundered and
oppressed by the empire and its richest allies with their
ruthless economic order, their financial institutions, their
debts of trillions of dollars imposed on underdeveloped
countries, which are forced every year to pay back more than they
borrowed, thus increasing exponentially a debt which continues to
multiply, leading hundreds of millions, billions of people toward
the edge of an abyss of hopelessness. This world order cannot
continue, this order is unsustainable, this order will come
crashing down since it is impossible to go on underestimating
nations, it is impossible to continue plundering and looking down
on nations that are learning and growing ever more aware of their
right to wellbeing and to life.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Our country has shown how much the people
of a small country are capable of enduring, what they are capable
of doing. We warn our enemies that Cuba is less and less alone,
that the Cuban people have more and more friends, despite the
lies that are the only ideology, the only weapon that can be
brandished by those who are devoid of ideas, those who are
utterly wrong. And such weapons will not override nor hide the
truth about the Cuban Revolution, nor the truth about our country
for much longer. There are people in every corner of the world
who, one way or another, express their appreciation, their
admiration and often their gratitude to this people which defied
all predictions and stood firm when great powers crumbled and it
was left alone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This is why I said that, more than a
school, this is bedrock for developing sports in Third World
countries (Applause) and above all in the countries of Latin
America and the Caribbean, which are our nearest sister
countries. In fact, a small country, a blockaded country that has
yet to emerge from the special period can do these things thanks
to its human capital, because what costs them 100 dollars costs
us one dollar, because human capital cannot be bought with money,
nor can all the money in the world achieve what can be achieved
with human capital. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Because of the way our people view things,
when they see facilities or buildings that are not doing any good
or serving any purpose, they may come up with the idea of
creating institutions like this one, or like the Latin American
School of Medical Sciences. It is because of this kind of
thinking that we can send more doctors to the countries that need
them than the United States and Europe combined. Note what I just
said: more than the United States and Europe combined. We could
also send more sports instructors than the United States and
Europe combined (Applause). And we could send more teachers than
both of them put together. We can give more proof of solidarity
and of internationalist spirit than the United States and Europe
combined, that is a fact. No comparison is possible, because the
noble and extraordinary idea of solidarity and internationalism
does not exist in the rich, developed, capitalist world. Such
ideas can only arise from the heart of a society that struggles
for brotherhood among peoples and nations, one that struggles for
justice in the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This has been our conduct so far, and it
will continue to be in the future, because we trust our people.
Those who think that when a leader disappears a revolution
disappears too have not understood --and I do not know if they
ever will-- something that I said years ago: &quot;Men die, the
Party is immortal.&quot; In this case, it would be even more
correct to say: &quot;Men die, nations are immortal.&quot;
(Applause) A man&#146;s ideas might disappear with him, but the
ideas that have taken root in the soul and in the heart of a
nation can never die (Applause). The ideas that any one of us may
express here are not only our ideas, but also the ideas of
millions and millions of people, of the overwhelming majority, of
almost all of our people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">That thirst for self-deception, that
craving to believe in the existence of so-called authentic
opposition forces shows the desperation, the need of the
imperialists to comfort themselves after the failures and defeats
suffered throughout these four decades. These have led them to
search for some illusion of comfort, thinking that a handful of
mercenaries, sustained with money from the empire and its allies,
constitute a force. Our people&#146;s political consciousness
allows for a perfect understanding of this, and those who invent
such fantasies have no idea whatsoever of how familiar our
Revolution&#146;s leaders are with our people&#146;s thinking and
feelings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We are not wandering about with our heads
in the clouds; we have our feet firmly on the ground. We are
aware, very much aware, of the unassailable strength of our
Revolution (APPLAUSE).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Allow me to add that when I was looking at
the scale model of the school, I even asked them to send me a
copy. This was because, as I was looking at the scale model and
asking about each and every one of the facilities that are
already finished and some that are yet to be completed, for
indoor gymnastics and some other sports, as I was looking at that
scale model and wondering whether the number of students should
be increased or not, if another building should be built --and I
could not find where to put it, because it would spoil the
symmetry, it would spoil the beauty of the whole-- I gave up on
the idea of increasing the enrollment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When I saw all that, plus some playing
fields and facilities that are to be built in the near future, I
came to the conclusion that even one student should not increase
the school&#146;s enrollment. Otherwise, we could end up with a
slightly greater number of students than is optimal. I say
optimal because I will leave this school with a great feeling of
satisfaction, of inspiration, over this International School of
Physical Education and Sports that we have fortunately been able
to create here with these buildings, most of them already in
place or scheduled to be finished soon. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If we take into account that our country
has more than 30,000 physical education and sports teachers and
is in the process of linking all the available physical education
and sports faculties, plus reestablishing certain facilities for
training intermediate level sports technicians who will then
continue with their studies --and even if we do not count this
international school which is being dedicated today-- we have the
capacity to train around 10,000 students as teachers in this
specialty.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">That is why I thought that if we had to
give an additional number of scholarships to other countries at
some time, we have 10,000 places available to meet the needs of
young people who want to study this worthy subject. Why add one
more here, disturbing what could be called the balance between
the number of students and the facilities the school will have
available? There is no need to disturb this balance when we have
the capacity that I just mentioned available, which allows us to
accept an additional number of students from overseas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Of course, our other schools are neither as
good nor as modern as this one. Nevertheless, they have trained
tens of thousands of teachers, who in turn have trained Cuban
world, Olympic and Pan-American champions. Our excellent physical
education and sports instructors and professors who have offered
their services in dozens and dozens of countries were trained in
these schools. Those who teach our children, our teenagers, our
youths, our adults, our pensioners who meet in the parks in
growing numbers to do exercises, were trained in them. For if a
child needs exercise, then a man in his later years --and I can
see that Fernández is laughing, we are more or less the same
age-- also needs to exercise. So, all our people benefit from the
services of our physical education and sports teachers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The schools also train physiotherapists who
work in rehabilitation hospitals, providing treatment for people
with physical problems that are the result of some illness or
accident. Sometimes they require months and months of
rehabilitation. We have seen these physiotherapists who come out
of our sports schools working eight straight hours a day, helping
a great many people to recover their health, or the ability to
move, the ability to lead a normal life.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To speak of physical exercise and sports is
to speak of health; it is to speak of discipline, of forming
young people&#146;s character, of healthy habits, of the battle
against drugs. Sports are the antithesis of drugs; sports are the
antithesis of alcoholism. Sports and physical exercise are a
preventive remedy for many illnesses that can kill or disable,
such as obesity, or a decrease in a person&#146;s faculties.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To speak of exercise and sports is not to
speak of world and Olympic champions, it is to speak of daily,
ongoing well-being, it is to speak of a good health, it is to
speak of the capacity for study and work. To speak of physical
education and sports is to speak of a science, a universal
activity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You might be athletes, but you have not
come to this school to be athletes. You have come here to be
trainers of athletes, to give a boost to sports in your
countries. Do not lose heart if there are only three or five or
ten of you. The New Testament reads that Christ sought out 12
fishermen. One of our great patriots also said that &quot;Twelve
men suffice to up-rise an entire nation,&quot; and no matter how
many of you there are in your countries, you should become into
physical education and sports apostles, and struggle on
(APPLAUSE). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You will be educators. You will proudly
carry the tittle of teachers and standard bearers of health and
well being to children, young people, adults and elders. Believe
me and try to understand this; be aware of the extraordinarily
noble, beneficial and beautiful responsibility that you will have
and obtain with the sacrifices you make here, far away from your
countries, far away from your loved ones.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Make this the very best sports school ever,
for you can be completely certain that, given the professors and
the facilities this school has, one day they will say about each
and every one of you not only that you are teachers and
specialists in this or that, they will say, &quot;They are
graduates of the International School of Physical Education and
Sports.&quot; It does not read Cuba there (HE POINTS TO THE NAME
OF THE SCHOOL), but when people talk about this unique and
unbeatable School of Physical Education and Sports, everyone will
know that it is the Cuban International School of Physical
Education and Sports that is being talked about (APPLAUSE AND
SHOUTS).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Just like economists from Harvard, from
Oxford, who are first and foremost </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">specialists in capitalist and imperialist
economics --albeit it is only fair to acknowledge that some are
innovators and some are very good and do not entirely agree with
the madness and the chaos that such a system implies-- just as
they enjoy world renown, I envy your future world renown
(APPLAUSE).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have always really liked sports, and I am
jealous that I am not one of you (APPLAUSE).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I will conclude now because there are
50-meter races with and without hurdles. There are 100, 200, 400,
800, 1500, 3000 and 5000-meter races. There are marathons as
well. Can I see the timer? I must be at about the 3000-meter
mark. (LAUGHTER).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">But, I will not say Patria o Muerte. I will
rather say: Long live internationalism! (APPLAUSE AND SHOUTS OF
&quot;LONG LIVE INTERNATIONALISM!&quot;).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Long live humanity! (APPLAUSE AND SHOUTS OF
&quot;LONG LIVE HUMANITY!&quot;) Which, as Martí said, is the
homeland of each and every human being.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Long live youth! (APPLAUSE AND SHOUTS OF
&quot;LONG LIVE YOUTH!&quot;)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Long live healthy, strong sports! (APPLAUSE
AND SHOUTS OF &quot;LONG LIVE HEALTHY, STRONG SPORT!&quot;)</font></p>
