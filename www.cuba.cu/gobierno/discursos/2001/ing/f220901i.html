<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">Speech by Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz, President of the Republic of Cuba. Havana, September 22, 2001</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fellow countrymen:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one can deny that terrorism is today a dangerous and ethically indefensible phenomenon, which should be eradicated regardless of its deep origins, the economic and political factors that brought it to live and those responsible for it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The unanimous irritation caused by the human and psychological damage brought on the American people by the unexpected and shocking death of thousands of innocent people whose images have shaken the world is perfectly understandable. But who have profited? The extreme right, the most backward and right-wing forces, those in favor of crushing the growing world rebellion and sweeping away everything progressive that is still left on the planet. It was an enormous error, a huge injustice and a great crime whomever they are who organized or are responsible for such action.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the tragedy should not be used to recklessly start a war that could actually unleash an endless carnage of innocent people and all of this on behalf of justice and under the peculiar and bizarre name of &quot;Infinite Justice&quot;.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the last few days we have seen the hasty establishment of the basis, the concept, the true purposes, the spirit and the conditions for such a war. No one would be able to affirm that it was not something thought out well in advance, something that was just waiting for its chance to materialize. Those who after the so-called end of the cold war continued a military build-up and the development of the most sophisticated means to kill and exterminate human beings were aware that the large military investments would give them the privilege to impose an absolute and complete dominance over the other peoples of the world. The ideologists of the imperialist system knew very well what they were doing and why they were doing it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the shock and sincere sorrow felt by every people on Earth for the atrocious and insane terrorist attack that targeted the American people, the most extremist ideologists and the most belligerent hawks, already set in privileged power positions, have taken command of the most powerful country in the world whose military and technological capabilities would seem infinite. Actually, its capacity to destroy and kill is enormous while its inclination towards equanimity, serenity, thoughtfulness and restrain is minimal.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The combination of elements  --including complicity and the common enjoyment of privileges-- the prevailing opportunism, confusion and panic make it almost impossible to avoid a bloody and unpredictable outcome.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first victims of whatever military actions are undertaken will be the billions of people living in the poor and underdeveloped world with their unbelievable economic and social problems, their unpayable debts and the ruinous prices of their basic commodities; their growing natural and ecological catastrophes, their hunger and misery, the massive undernourishment of their children, teenagers and adults; their terrible AIDS epidemic, their malaria, their tuberculosis and their infectious diseases that threaten whole nations with extermination.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The grave economic world crisis was already a real and irrefutable fact affecting absolutely every one of the big economic power centers. Such crisis will inevitably grow deeper under the new circumstances and when it becomes unbearable for the overwhelming majority of the peoples, it will bring chaos, rebellion and the impossibility to govern.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the price will also be unpayable for the rich countries. For years to come it would be impossible to speak strong enough about the environment and the ecology, or about ideas and research done and tested, or about projects for the protection of Nature because that space and possibility would be taken by military actions, war and crimes as infinite as &quot;Infinite Justice&quot;, that is, the name given to the war operation to be unleashed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can there be any hope left after having listened, hardly 36 hours ago, to the speech made the President before de U.S. Congress?  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will avoid the use of adjectives, qualifiers or offensive words towards the author of that speech. They would be absolutely unnecessary and untimely when the tensions and seriousness of the moment advise thoughtfulness and equanimity. I will limit myself to underline some short phrases that say it all:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We will use every necessary weapon of war.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign unlike any other we have ever seen.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Every nation in every region now has a decision to make. Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I’ve called the armed forces to alert and there is a reason. The hour is coming when America will act and you will make us proud.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This is the world’s fight, this is civilization’s fight.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I ask for your patience [...] in what will be a long struggle.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The great achievement of our time and the great hope of every time, now depend on us.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. [...] And we know that God is not neutral.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask our fellow countrymen to meditate deeply and calmly on the ideas contained in several of the above-mentioned phrases:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">.  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No nation of the world has been left out of the dilemma, not even the big and powerful states; none has escaped the threat of war or attacks.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">.   We will use any weapon.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No procedure has been excluded, regardless of its ethics, or any threat whatever fatal, either nuclear, chemical, biological or any other.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">.   It will not be short combat but a lengthy war, lasting many years, unparalleled in </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">    history.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">.   It is the world’s fight; it is civilization’s fight.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">.   The achievements of our times and the hope of every time, now depend on us.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, an unheard of confession in a political speech on the eve of a war, and no less than in times of apocalyptic risks: The course of this conflict is not known; yet its outcome is certain. And we know that God is not neutral.       </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an amazing assertion. When I think about the real or imagined parties involved that bizarre holy war that is about to begin, I find it difficult to make a distinction about where fanaticism is stronger.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Thursday, before the United States Congress, the idea was designed of a world military dictatorship under the exclusive rule of force, irrespective of any international laws or institutions. The United Nations Organization, simply ignored in the present crisis, would fail to have any authority or prerogative whatsoever. There would be only one boss, only one judge, and only one law.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have all been ordered to ally either with the United States government or with terrorism.    </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cuba, the country that has suffered the most and the longest from terrorist actions, the one whose people are not afraid of anything because there is no threat or power in the world that can intimidate it, with a high morale Cuba claims that it is opposed to terrorism and opposed to war. Although the possibilities are now remote, Cuba reaffirms the need to avert a war of unpredictable consequences whose very authors have admitted not to have the least idea of how the events will unfold. Likewise, Cuba reiterates its willingness to cooperate with every country in the total eradication of terrorism.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An objective and calm friend should advise the United States government against throwing the young American soldiers into an uncertain war in remote, isolated and inaccessible places, like a fight against ghosts, not knowing where they are or even if they exist or not, or whether the people they kill are or not responsible for the death of their innocent fellow countrymen killed in the United States.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cuba will never declare itself an enemy of the American people that is today subjected to an unprecedented campaign to sow hatred and a vengeful spirit, so much so that even the music that sings to peace has been banned. On the contrary, Cuba will make that music its own, and even our children will sing their songs to peace while the announced bloody war lasts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever happens, the territory of Cuba will never be used for terrorist actions against the American people and we will do everything within our reach to prevent such actions against that people. Today we are expressing our solidarity while urging to peace and calmness. One day they will admit we were right.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our independence, our principles and our social achievements we will defend with honor to the last drop of blood, if we are attacked!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will not be easy to fabricate pretexts to do it. They are already talking about a war using all the necessary weapons but it will be good recalling that not even that would be a new experience. Almost four decades ago, hundreds of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons were aimed at Cuba and nobody remembers anyone of our countrymen sleepless over that.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are the same sons and daughters of that heroic people, with a patriotic and revolutionary conscience that is higher than ever. It is time for serenity and courage.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The world will grow aware of this and will raise its voice in the face of the terrible threatening drama that it is about to suffer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for Cubans, this is the right time to proclaim more proud and resolute than ever:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Socialism or death!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homeland or death! </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will overcome!</P></FONT></BODY>
