<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>First offered to a mere 18 pupils in a primary school
in Pilón –better to say, a little school in Pilón--, equipped with a single
computer powered by solar energy, the Introductory Computer Sciences Course,
four years after its inception, benefits 74 374 primary school students who now
have access to 2 021 computers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

primary and secondary education audiovisual programs already have 7 460
television sets, 3 581 VCRs and 5 054 computers at their disposal. Four hundred
and eighty five schools that had no electricity are now powered by </span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-language:ES'>photovoltaic cells
--the so-called solar panels.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those
schools do not need to invest a single cent in fuel in order to have the
electricity they require to operate these equipment or even to have light</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>; 167 of these schools have an enrollment
of less than 5 pupils, and 24 have only one pupil and a teacher. These schools
embody the principle that no child ought to be deprived of schooling, no matter
how remote their place of residence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>The Comprehensive Upgrading Course for Young People
(SHOUTS FROM THE AUDIENCE) was inaugurated --that was four years ago here, in
Granma, in the city of Manzanillo, on that evening-- with an enrollment of 12
124 students. Today, some 17 930 students are enrolled. A total of 17 950 young
people who have completed these courses have begun university studies.
Including these, Granma can report the figure of 47 409 students enrolled in
higher education, three times the number for the entire country at the time the
Revolution triumphed. Enrollment in the 39 university degree programs offered
has increased considerably thanks to a program aimed at making higher education
accessible to everyone, which has opened 54 new chapters across all of the
province's municipalities (APPLAUSE).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>At the time, Granma’s unemployment rate was 10.7 %;
today, it has dropped to 1.6 % (APLAUSE). I remember that sometime before that
date, we spoke about a 17 % unemployment rate in Granma, or at least in
Manzanillo.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That figure was really
dramatic.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many factories were shut down
during the special period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>During those days, a Video Viewing Rooms Program was
also set in motion to take television programs to rural populations living in
isolated regions. Back then, the province had 171 such rooms.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were many, and we felt proud about
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today, there are 454 rooms, the
country's highest number. If we add up all visits paid to these rooms so far,
figures will show that they have been visited by the rural population more than
4 million times (APPLAUSE).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>These facilities, in addition to offering
entertainment, have become centers where people learn and play chess –which is
good to develop the brain muscles—(LAUGHTER), take courses on sanitary issues
and participate in other important social activities. Three hundred and sixty
four of these rooms have been especially equipped and staffed to offer
rehabilitation services to the community (<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>Applause</span>).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>I remember the day when we first came across
that idea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they were already in
place, if their construction was solid, if they had electricity, all we needed
to do was to find a place to install there the equipment that was needed by so
many people who were unable to come down from the mountains, or move from a
far-off place to Media Luna or Niquero<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>or Pilón to go to a polyclinic where they could receive the adequate
treatment for any kind of injury or find a solution to any of their needs,
which are many more<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>that anyone can
imagine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ten new Video Viewing Rooms are
currently being set up. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>The Visual Arts Teaching Program was opened at the
“Carlos Enríquez” Academy, in a refurbished and expanded building in
Manzanillo. Bayamo's “Oswaldo Guayasamín” Academy, a newly inaugurated
institution, has joined the program. Both institutions have graduated 83
students, and their current combined enrollment amounts to 171 students (<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>Applause</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>At the time, the refurbishing of the Manzanillo
Theatre, which had been shut down for thirty years, was still underway. The
repair process has been completed and over 120 000 theatre-goers have enjoyed
580 shows which have been staged there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>Programs for the creation of concert bands gained
momentum and a school for training in the specialty, one of a kind in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, was created. This made it possible for
all of the province's municipalities to have their own band (<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>Applause</span>).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ten bands were assembled in the 13
territories which did not have any; 2 children's bands were created, and
another 2 were created in prisons. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>In keeping with these ideas, prison inmates were also
offered access to upgrading courses. Of these, 243 have reached 12<sup>th</sup>
grade of education and 140 have completed courses offered by the Youth Computer
Clubs (<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>Applause</span>), instead of
resorting to violence and drugs, with which no one could be re-educated, or,
better to say, educated, because, as a rule, those persons end up in prison
because they never received proper education.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Let us all educate, and we will see how the numbers of those who go to
prison will be reduced (SHOUTS OF “LONG LIVE FIDEL!”).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>There are already 43 Youth Computer Clubs in the
province equipped with a total of 524 computers. To date, 59 473 students have
completed courses in these (APPLAUSE). Seven new Clubs will be built as part of
this program (SHOUTS OF “LONG LIVE!”). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>Over this period of time, 614 works as part of the
Battle of Ideas and four other major constructions of great social significance
have been completed in Granma. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

today these services use state-of-the-art technology. They offer 24 hour

with which they began to write the glorious history of our homeland. There, in
