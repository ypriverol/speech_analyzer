<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

Mexican periodical <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Por Esto! </span></i><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

reached the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> by crossing the Texan border in a car and

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> government knew, from day one, through

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Abascal,
Álvarez and Mitat were the crew of the <i>Santrina</i>, as were skipper José

in a reef area on </span><st1:date Month="3" Day="14" Year="2005"><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>March 14, 2005</span></st1:date><span

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, where it arrived four days later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>In his
comments for the CUBADEBATE web-site, renowned lawyer José Pertierra, the
Venezuelan government’s legal representative in the extradition case of the
Cuban-born terrorist who is a naturalized citizen of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Venezuela</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, evaluated the FBI documents in this way:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;By
affirming that Posada Carriles entered the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> on the <i>Santrina </i>with Santiago Álvarez
Fernández Magriñá, the prosecution itself is questioning the credibility of
Posada, Álvarez, his accomplices and even the White House.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Upon
entering the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> illegally, Posada and his accomplices
lied to protect the <i>Santrina</i> crew. &quot;To help a terrorist enter the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> illegally is a very serious felony that
is punishable by several years in prison. To lie to cover up a felony is also a
federal crime&quot;, added the legal expert. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;'Now
we learn that one of the people who helped Posada to enter the country
illegally worked for the FBI. It is evident that the White House has always
known how Posada entered the country, with whom he entered, and where he was
living’, assured Pertierra, who added: '<span class=GramE>This</span>
besmirches them all’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;’If the FBI knew —argues Pertierra—, the
Security Department knew.</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
Arial'> Why didn’t they arrest him in March? Why didn’t they press charges
against Álvarez and Mitat for having helped a terrorist to illegally enter the
country?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;A
month before these statements appeared in the Herald, on March 22, the US
Immigration and Customs Enforcement wrote Posada Carriles a letter to explain
the reasons why he, tried as a mere ‘illegal immigrant’, continued in prison.
In the letter, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement <span class=GramE>tells</span>
Posada that he: ‘...will not be released from the custody of US Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE) at this time, because, as described below, you
continue to present a danger to the community and a flight risk’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Further
on, the letter states that Posada has a ‘history of engaging in criminal
activity, associating with individuals involved in criminal activity and
participating in violent acts that indicate a disregard for the safety of the
general public and a propensity for engaging in activities proscribed within the
provisions of INA § 212(a) that pose a risk to the national security of the
United States’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;Further,
you have shown a cavalier attitude towards the impact your actions have had on
the safety and well-being of persons and property. Open source information and
your own statements link you to the planning and coordination of a series of
hotel and restaurant bombings that occurred in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> over a several month period in 1997.
Moreover, on </span><st1:date Year="2004" Day="20" Month="4"><span lang=EN-US
 style='font-family:Arial'>April 20, 2004</span></st1:date><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>, you were convicted in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Panama</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> for Crimes <span class=GramE>Against</span>
National Security and Counterfeiting Public Records, for which you were
sentenced to 7 years and 1 year imprisonment respectively. Although you were
later pardoned for these crimes by the President of Panama, a foreign pardon,
in itself, does not have any effect in relation to US immigration laws.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Additionally, a review of your arrest and
criminal history shows that following a trial and acquittal on criminal charges
in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
  Arial'>Venezuela</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>, your acquittal was overturned on appeal, and, while
pending a retrial on the charges, you made several escape attempts and
eventually succeeded in escaping from prison. Due to your long history of
criminal activity and violence in which innocent civilians were killed, your
release from detention would pose a danger to both the community and the
national security of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>At the
end of the letter, the ICE reminds the terrorist that his &quot;expertise in
assuming false identities, your disregard of the immigration laws of the United
States, your history of escape and the presence of your pending international
extradition request demonstrate that you pose a significant risk of fleeing, if
released from custody&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>In
spite of the facts mentioned by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in
its letter, Posada Carriles continues to enjoy many privileges and is not in
the least bit treated as a criminal. While thousands of illegal immigrants are
persecuted, imprisoned and sent back to their countries, in the midst of the
largest political mobilization by Latinos seen in decades, terrorist Luis
Posada Carriles has the privilege of a nearly 6-hour-long hearing to review his
request for </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

imprisonment for illegal possession of explosives, after being accused of
heading an Alpha ‘66 paramilitary camp in Pomona ranch, where Mexicans were

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I was
saying that Alpha ‘66 participated in several of the so-called &quot;autonomous
operations&quot; directed by the CIA from its JM/WAVE Miami station. The
criminal actions this group has perpetrated include pirate attacks and the
hijacking of fishing vessels; armed infiltrations into our country; death
threats aimed at people with links to Cuba living in Mexico, the United States,
Ecuador, Brazil, Canada and Puerto Rico, and numerous attempts to assassinate
me. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Miami</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Don’t
forget that this gentleman I mentioned, Santiago Álvarez Fernández Magriña,
that guy —you've seen him on TV—who gave orders over the phone to a man who had
infiltrated Cuba, who he had sent with explosives and firearms. The infiltrator
was captured and Fernández Magriña, who was <span class=GramE>later</span>
arrested for who knows how many crimes in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> —yes, Mr. Magriña, buddy of the Bushes—
was the head of that group gave it orders over the phone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>You
recall that phrase, the last instructions he gave. When he asked whether the
infiltrator had seen the plan through or not, and the latter responded that things
were getting complicated, he asked about the mission he had been tasked with, a
monstrous act of terrorism on the Tropicana cabaret, he said: “Throw the two
tins inside, through a window of the cabaret, and nothing will remain standing”.
He admitted that he had said this and he was there in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Miami</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> government. Apparently, there was a
conflict of interests at one point or other and the government had no other
choice but to arrest him and accuse him of some of the hundreds of crimes he
committed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Posada
Carriles was there, all of these things were taking place in Miami and this
super-organization, designed to protect the United States from terrorism
--headed by Negroponte who is implicated in the dirty war in Nicaragua-- which
controls over 30 intelligence organizations, didn't know anything. The State
Department declared on numerous occasions that it didn't know Posada Carriles'
whereabouts. The White House said it didn't know, and everyone else was saying
the same thing, that they didn't know anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Just
look at how morally, how ethically impoverished they are, how low they have

took him out of Panama, because the US government knew of and was responsible
for the assassination plans that were to be executed at that meeting of heads

know nothing of these things, nor of the plans to blow up Tropicana, where,
back then, there were doubtless many US citizens, because, then, they allowed
some Cuban-born people who were naturalized citizens of the United States and
even US citizens, people who had been born in and were citizens of the United

president— and his partner Eusebio de Jesús Peñalver Mazorra, arrested in

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> possession of an arsenal of weapons, when
he participated in the preparations for a terrorist action against Cuba, and
another notorious terrorist, Ángel Francisco D'fana Serrano. Never have US
governments been unaware of these entire terrorist and assassination plans. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I
mentioned two exceptions in this long period: President Ford who, following the
investigation on plans to assassinate me conducted by the (US Senate) Church
Commission, apparently embarrassed by these, had issued a resolution
prohibiting these types of actions. Another president who was unquestionably
incapable of ordering these kinds of assassinations was Carter, whom we know
well —he visited us and participated in that important baseball game between a
team from Baltimore and Cuba, he visited the University of Havana and spoke
there, engaging in discussions—, he doesn't share our ideas, his ideology is
not even remotely related to ours, but we can say that he is an honest
American. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Then,
the same people who had organized Operation Condor, the bombing of the Cuban
airliner in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> and myriad international crimes returned
to office. They were the same and are the same people who are today in power in
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:

style='font-family:Arial'>. Some are even worse, because a number of them were
old hawks and these are the apprentices of hawks that want to outdo their
masters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>It
remains to be seen whether they can do this or not, whether the American people
will allow it, if they are willing to put up with more crimes like the genocide
and the countless acts of torture they are committing around the world today,
in any country in the world, encroaching upon the sovereignty and borders of
nations and ordering killings. Not long ago, at a joint session of the US
Congress, Bush said that many enemies of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> would no longer bother it because they
were either in prison or dead. He said it with haughtiness, with arrogance, and
what he said meant: I have ordered the killing of everyone I have felt like
killing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>This
is what he has done. Bush was quick to rescind Ford's decree and, with the
support of the President of the US National Rifle Association who was at the
House, he repealed the prohibition to commit those crimes and misdeeds. Not
even </span><st1:City><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Rome</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>’s worst emperors dared to claim such
rights, of killing, of assassinating —through any means possible, resorting to
the most sophisticated means— any patriot, any revolutionary, any political
leader who opposes the empire’s vulgar efforts of domination. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>No one
has the right to issue such an order, even when dealing with terrorists. Where
is the Law, where are the laws, where are the courts? Even though some of the
empire's judges are also repulsive, like the one who sentenced our Five Heroes,
a ruling that <span class=GramE>a court</span> acting with a minimum of freedom
and honor later had to overturn, the notorious Court of Atlanta, which
overturned that trial’s ruling. Then, instead of releasing them, something
unprecedented took place, they appealed the court’s ruling, turning —even from
the point of view of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

And they remain in prison, while Posada Carriles is granted a hearing to
discuss his right to US citizenship, perhaps because of the crimes he’s
committed, perhaps because of his moral fiber, similar to that of the illustrious
character that holds executive power in that country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>On
June 2, 2005, the US president expressed his gratitude for Alpha ‘66’s &quot;support&quot;
in a letter in which he stated that he &quot;appreciated knowing&quot; the
ideas of the paramilitary group. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

cable agency UPI reported that a group of Cubans and Nicaraguans were receiving
military training in a remote and derelict camp site in the south of Florida
operated by Alpha ‘66, but the FBI and the authorities of the Californian city
of San Bernardino did not consider these actions illegal for, according to them
they were not in violation of any local or state law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

November 1999, news arrived from California that René Cruz and Eusebio Peñalver
(both closely linked to Posada Carriles) and terrorists Roberto Martín Pérez, Ángel
D'Fana and Ernesto Díaz, Alpha ‘66's current leader, were involved in a plan to
assassinate President Hugo Chávez, receiving aid from a group of wealthy
Venezuelan individuals. This was denounced by </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> in a timely fashion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>In the
first quarter of 2006, Cuba's economy grew by 11.8 % more what it did in 2005;
its current growth rate —hear this—<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> </b>is
of more than 12.5 % (Applause). I know %ages can get annoying and that they are
both used and abused. Some people say: &quot;There's such and such %age of
growth, but where do we see it?&quot; If you're building the premises to
produce eggs and poultry meat and breeding the chicks you need, you're growing
but you're not distributing eggs —though eggs are already being distributed— do
you understand? If you construct high-tech storage silos to conserve the
grains, you're making an investment; if you buy hundreds of locomotives and
repair thousands of wagons, or purchase trucks and motors by the tens of
thousands, and you reconstruct everything, or if you work in an enormous<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>plan to construct houses after a hurricane
razed more than 50,000 to the ground —and it did more than raze houses to the
ground, you also have to count the houses that were damaged, those that required
new roofs and many other things— you’re not seeing the finished houses, you may
not even visit the site of the disaster. A bus on a ship sailing across the
Atlantic is not yet in service; when it arrives, one first tests it and uses it
to address the country's urgent needs, it is not yet picking up passengers down
a regular route. When you start using the bus, you really have to look at the
routes you're going to assign to it, though these vehicles are not used
exclusively in bus routes, the country needs to and has the duty to optimize the
resources and costs associated to every route. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>That
is why we speak of growth which is not yet immediately evident. But we're
starting to see some things, you know this, everyone knows this, and these
things are becoming ever more numerous and reaching never-before-seen figures.
We're not after luxury; we're not simply moved by a desire to improve the
living standard of our people, which is our greatest wish, for our people to
live better in every sense of the word. We're not <span class=GramE>selfish,</span>
we want to support other peoples of the world, because humanity is one. I spoke
of this not long ago, on the 29th. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I say
this because we need to learn many things, all of us, you and we; you, many of
you well educated, there are already more than half a million Cubans pursuing
higher education studies, and we also, who didn't have such privileges, some of
us have to learn more, and less, than others, depending on how privileged we
were. We are all duty-bound to think and learn constantly, to learn from the
lessons of history and continue till our last breath. No one graduates at the
end of the fifth or sixth year of their university studies —and, in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, this is less and less the case— nor when
they specialize or complete a Masters degree or a doctorate. Some will reach
this level, not everyone, because there are many things to do for society. This
won’t be true of everyone, but it will be true of more and more people, and not
one of them will ever cease learning. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The
industrial sector as a whole remained at levels similar to those reported in

underway since mid-February and we're reaching the objectives set forth, at a
time when the price of sugar in the world market is favorable. These efforts
are indeed worthy of recognition, especially if we consider different,
pre-existing factors that demanded even greater efforts, efforts that were made
to obtain surprising results: having produced less than 200,000 tons on Saint
Valentine’s Day, February 14, today we are already producing 1,100, 000 tons,
nearly 80 % of the goal figure, and there are still some weeks of harvest left,
though refineries are slowing down in terms of milling and the rain and heat is
intensifying, reducing performance rates. But we won't far off the goal we've

we are talking about fuels used domestically by the population. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The
consumption of diesel fuel also dropped by 7,000 metric tons, as did gasoline
consumption, which had gone down by 1,000 metric tons up until March, in spite
of the economic growth achieved: there are more bricks, more blocks, more
concrete, more rods, all of this has to be transported, don't forget. Cuba's
energy intensity figures (units of energy per unit of GDP) —not including

a question we must ask ourselves, because, from it, we can derive the truly
significant figure of over one million kilowatts/hour —I would say that well
over one million kilowatts/hour—saved, that is to say, what would be being used
without the energy saving measures, during consumption peak hours. <b

there are many things still to be done to reduce the country's total energy
consumption. There are energy saving measures, more energy is being consumed in
some places and less in others. All of these factories I am mentioning and all
of these production and growth processes consume and consume energy, especially
electricity. The number of new consumers of electricity has gone up to
approximately 43 thousand. Not only is the economy growing, the number of
consumers is growing as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has been increased by 5 % through the use of ENERGAS natural gas…One of these
facilities, one of the most economical ones, was giving us a bit of headache
some days ago, strong winds that hindered the supply process, the accompanying

6.1 % savings at the plants, we're talking about savings in terms of

transmission and distribution —we’ve seen a reduction in this sense— (which
went from 17.99 % to 15.75 % in that period). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to be done. Just about everything that will be distributed from now on will be
energy-saving equipment, electricity-saving equipment, which will multiply, by
several times, hard currency resources that are today needed for many other
things and to continue investing and improving, as much as possible,
consumption by the population. Only this way, through the use of electrical
appliances, will the country free itself from these things that horrify us, such
as kerosene and its derivates, which all of you, save for our invitees, know
well— and 967 thousand 56 fans. You know very well how many were being
manufactured using the motors of Aurika washing machines which were imported
into the country by the millions and which guzzle electricity; nearly one
million have been replaced. In addition to this, 9 million 118 thousand 250
energy-saving light fixtures have been distributed to households to date. You
know about this well, there are still some bulbs out there that have not been
replaced, those that must replaced by better and more economical fixtures won't

to 65.3 % at the end of 2005 –well, it was in 2005 that we prohibited the
circulation of the dollar, not deposits, any citizen knows that he/she can
deposit foreign currency at the bank and withdraw it, that money is sacred,
untouchable; before, most deposits were made in foreign currencies. Today, 65.3
% are in convertible pesos. These are highly important economic data, let the
Chicago Boys say so, yes, they’re always talking about that, to muddle things

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, at the Pinar <span class=GramE>del</span>
Río ceremony, we stated: “On the First of May we shall have reached the
capacity to generate 1 million KW, equivalent to 3.3 thermo-power stations like
the ‘Antonio Guiteras’”. This is what I said.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This figure has been surpassed. <span class=GramE>(Applause).</span> Today,
on May Day, we have an installed capacity of more than 1,100,000 KW with the
synchronized generators and the emergency generators with a capacity above 120
KW.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That amounts to one hundred thousand
kilowatts, more than 3.3 times as much the real capacity of the “Antonio
Guiteras” thermo power station installed in less than eight months.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This plant took six or seven years to be
constructed, it shuts down all the time, right now it is not functioning, it's
there as a reserve. A number of plants are on stand-by, saving on fuel. The
truth is that the largest of them is currently not working, the one that cost
God knows how many hundreds of millions, which we had to finance from the time
we ordered it, the one that’s caused our country so many headaches. There are a
number of such large plants either on stand-by or working at half their
capacity which, of course, we still need, because this is a program which is
still in development, though we need them for only a little while longer. We'll
see what happens in the course of a year. We'll see, I can't tell you about
everything today, we have to save some for later. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>At that meeting in January we referred to the
importance of using accompanying gas, a source of pollution, which can be used
after a simple purification process, as a fuel for power generation at the
lowest possible cost for our country. Once we make this investment, we will be
able to produce one kilowatt for less than two cents.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>As part of the process of making the most use from
accompanying gas, we have completed the substitution in Havana of LPG cylinders
which used to be distributed using methane—this accompanying gas began to be
used not long ago; before, we used naphtha, some naphtha, some gas, which would
blacken containers, this is no longer the case— after the starting up of the
Marianao Plant last February. This measure has allowed us to save, until today,
8, 650 tons of naphtha and 158 tons of liquefied gas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>Quick progress is being made in the studies, research
and tests that will allow us to resort to wind energy as soon as possible. We
have already purchased the first 100 pieces of equipment —they're due to
arrive— and, most especially, towers to measure wind speeds in all of the
country's key regions. There are good prospects for many of these regions.
We'll see when we have the information, how quickly we can build these. This
system adjusts itself well to wind energy, because winds are whimsical and
unpredictable, for a system with large plants like we had it was impossible to
synchronize electricity produced through wind power. Eight hours would suffice
and the process would be very economically efficient. We have places in which
12, 15 and 20 hours are guaranteed, and places in which measurements are being
made and the speed has not dropped to a level below that required to produce
electricity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
