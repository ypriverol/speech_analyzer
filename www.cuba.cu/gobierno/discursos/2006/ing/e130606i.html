<p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>EDITORIAL <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
Arial'>There is no need to burn papers<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Yesterday,
June </span><st1:metricconverter ProductID="12, a"><span lang=EN-US
 style='font-family:Arial'>12, a</span></st1:metricconverter><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'> rabid lapdog of the empire and the terrorist mafia
in Miami, <b>El Nuevo Herald</b>, published an article titled &quot;U.S.
Interests Section in Havana Under Siege,&quot; in which it accuses the Cuban
government of cutting off electricity and water supplies to that office as a
response to what it describes as &quot;a deepening of the diplomatic
crisis&quot; that began when &quot;the electronic billboard was installed on
the facade of the Interests Section.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>According
to the article, &quot;the United States Interests Section in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Havana</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> had issued instructions to its personnel
on Friday to begin destroying all non-essential documents&quot;. It adds this
suspicious conclusion: &quot;The sources who offered this information to <b>El
Nuevo Herald</b> consider the destruction of documents in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> diplomatic offices in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Havana</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> the prelude to an evacuation, or at the
very least, a preparation for one if it were necessary.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The <b>El
Nuevo Herald</b> article insidiously included a photo taken during one of the
historic Marches of the Combatant People that passed by the Interests Section (USINT),
in which our people appear in the surroundings of that office reaffirming their
repudiation of the imperialist and genocidal policies towards Cuba. The purpose
is to manipulate readers into believing that at this moment the USINT is permanently
surrounded by our compatriots, when everything is actually normal there and
only the specialized personnel charged with guarding that facility are in the
area. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The
article ends by slipping in a sentence that exposes the real hidden intentions
behind this latest maneuver: &quot;In response to the aggravating situation in
its offices, the U.S. Interests Section in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Havana</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> could be temporarily forced to suspend
its activities, something that would explain the step of beginning to destroy
important documents.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>A few
hours later, confirming the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> government’s involvement in the fabrication
and direction of this deceitful campaign, State Department spokesman Sean
McCormack cynically insisted on accusing our government of harassing USINT.
Playing the victim, McCormack said that despite the alleged difficulties with
electricity and water supplies, USINT continued with &quot;business as usual&quot;,
including its efforts to &quot;reach out to the Cuban people,&quot; and
impudently affirmed that the alleged hostility towards USINT could be linked to
its efforts to &quot;offer basic information and facts to the Cuban
people.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Thus,
the lying spokesman qualified the growing attempts at espionage and subversion
that USINT is carrying out in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> as &quot;business as usual&quot;. What he
referred to as &quot;efforts to reach out to the Cuban people&quot; are the
patronage, direction and generous financing of mercenary <span class=SpellE>grouplets</span>
nursed by USINT in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> and comprised of traitors and stoolies
who collaborate with the implementation of the brutal blockade intended to
bring our people to their knees through hunger and sickness. And, at the height
of insolence, he describes as &quot;offering basic information and facts to the
Cuban people&quot; the systematic launching of the crudest insults towards our
people via the electronic billboard, which, in violation of the most elemental norms
of international law, they think they can maintain with impunity on the facade
of that imperial lair. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>To get
an idea of the type of &quot;information and facts&quot; that USINT has been
spreading via its electronic billboard, let’s take just one example: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;Many
decent Cuban women cannot live decently without doing something indecent. If
you are young and pretty, what is it that pays more, to pursue a career or a
Spaniard?&quot; (April 7 and 8)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>In the
afternoon, Drew <span class=SpellE>Blakeney</span>, spokesman for the U.S.
Interests Section in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Havana</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, told a bald-faced lie in a statement to
the press when he affirmed: &quot;The regime's increasing resort to bullying
tactics in dealing with USINT and the Cuban people comes as no surprise; it has
been trying to isolate and harass the Interests Section for some time.&quot; He
also added, &quot;On Monday, June 5, at approximately </span><st1:time
Minute="0" Hour="3"><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>3:00 a.m.</span></st1:time><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, electricity supplies to the main
building of the U.S. Interests Section in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Havana</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> were cut off.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>El
Nuevo Herald</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> and </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> government spokespersons are shamelessly
lying when they hold our government responsible for a supposed power cut and a
decrease in the availability of drinking water to the Interests Section. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We
categorically deny any premeditated power-cuts aimed at obstructing the
operations of the US Interests Section. In fact, there were a large number of
power failures in the city of Havana and throughout the country; one of them
occurred along the underground 13,000-volt circuit Vedado2, which directly feeds
the Interests Section offices, and one of the two channels that supplies
electric power to the Anti-Imperialist Tribune, due to the adverse weather
conditions experienced by the country over the last two weeks up until
yesterday afternoon, Monday (June 12): repair work on this interruption is
underway just like on all the others. In spite of that, as the spokespeople
admit, USINT has continued to operate unhindered, as has its provocative electronic
billboard which, since January 16 and for almost five months now, has been
offending and insulting our people, demonstrating that that facility has not
lacked even one watt of electricity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Maliciously,
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
  Arial'>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'> government chooses to avoid mentioning that every
time USINT has reported difficulties with the supply of drinking water or
electric power to its facilities, these have been duly attended to by the Cuban
companies that provide those services. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>USINT
consumes an average of 26,000 kilowatts monthly, the same amount of electricity
consumed by about 200 average Cuban families. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>In
spite of the reorganization of fuel distribution undertaken in the entire country,
USINT has been supplied by CUBALSE, a total of </span><st1:metricconverter
ProductID="53,756 liters"><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>53,756
 liters</span></st1:metricconverter><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>
of fuel to date this year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>In
spite of the severe drought, and general difficulties in supplying drinking
water to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Havana</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> which, before the recent rains, were
affecting almost the entire country, the capital’s water company has maintained
a stable water supply to USINT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>In response
to a USINT request, in March of this year, the water company sent its
technicians to the USINT main building and annex to check the internal and
external aqueduct mains and to repair whatever faulty system it came across. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>From
January 2006 to date, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>’s CUBALSE Company has carried out seven
maintenance or repair operations in the buildings housing USINT officials.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>In
spite of the fact that, on February 1, USINT rudely expelled from its
facilities workers from the <span class=SpellE>Blas</span> <span class=SpellE>Roca</span>
<span class=SpellE>Caderío</span> Contingent, who were carrying out
construction work on the annex building, CUBALSE has been punctually supplying
USINT with materials for continuing the construction work. To date, USINT has
received the </span><st1:metricconverter ProductID="44 cubic meters"><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>44 cubic meters</span></st1:metricconverter><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> of premixed concrete, </span><st1:metricconverter
ProductID="540 meters"><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>540 meters</span></st1:metricconverter><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> of rebar and </span><st1:metricconverter
ProductID="300 meters"><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>300 meters</span></st1:metricconverter><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> of steel sheeting that it has requested. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>USINT
currently has 302 Cuban workers under contract. To date this year, nine of
those workers have traveled abroad on the request of USINT, with the aim of
receiving training needed to carry out their duties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The
U.S. spokespersons likewise choose not to mention the most important fact: that,
during this year alone, USINT has received immediate approval for 33 requested
operations to return illegal emigrants, without any delay or exception
whatsoever; four operations to repatriate Cuban citizens considered to be ineligible
by U.S. authorities, and eight consular visits to U.S. citizens being held in
Cuban jails. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The
latest accusations against the Cuban government are part of the US
administration’s plans, exposed by comrade Fidel on January 22 and 24 of 2006,
when he affirmed, verbatim: &quot;Under pressures from the Cuban-American
mafia, and as one of its next steps, the government of the United States is
intent on openly violating the U.S.–Cuba Migratory Agreement (...) It is
looking for any pretext to prevent, at all costs, the sale of agricultural
products to Cuba, which has been increasing, while our country has paid every
cent on time during five years –something it did not expect from a blockaded
nation facing constant aggression (...) And, unhappy with the decision taken by
President Carter on May 30, 1977, it intends to force a rupture of its current
minimal diplomatic ties with Cuba. The gross provocations that have been
carried out from its Interests Section offices in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Havana</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> do not and cannot have any other
purpose.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The
latest accusations against Cuba also perfidiously aim to draw attention away from
the real problem, the subversive and provocative nature of the actions of USINT
which, in frank violation of the diplomatic status conferred upon it by
international agreements and conventions, has become the General Staff of the
counterrevolution, which it directs and materially and financially supplies in
order to incite the subversion of our country’s internal order. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Perhaps
they think that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> is afraid of the constant provocations
devised against our homeland or the consequences of a rupture of the minimal
existing ties, already substantially deteriorated due to the immoral and
cynical policies of the Bush administration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>It is
up to the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
  Arial'>United</span></st1:PlaceName><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>
 </span><st1:PlaceType><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>State</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>’s imperialist government to explain its
demented and reiterated practice of devising and implementing new brutal
measures against </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, and its vain attempts to break the
heroic spirit of resistance of our people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> government is sinking morally and
materially in its war of conquest in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Iraq</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, corruption scandals, growing budget and
account deficits, high energy prices, inability to overcome natural disasters,
illegal espionage against its own citizens, and the repugnant practice of
clandestine arrests and torture on a global scale. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The
Revolutionary government has provided a lesson in equanimity, firmness and
strict adherence to diplomatic regulations in its response to the vulgar,
contemptible actions of USINT and the mercenaries at its service in our
country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>With
our moral authority and our principles, we will defeat each and every one of
its criminal and cowardly campaigns, provocations and aggressions!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> looks the enemy in the face and has no dirty
tricks up its sleeve; it has no reason to seek pretexts to harass USINT. It
knows how to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to requests by the empire’s
representatives. It is not looking for subterfuges, or trying to cut electric
cables to turn off stupid little signs. It is not harassing </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> officials or representatives. The
millions of people who have paraded past those facilities with honor and
dignity, including children and teenagers, have never thrown a single stone
against that building. Throughout the history of the Revolution, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> has always fought with a moral authority
that crushes its enemies. If the current U.S. government is seeking pretexts to
remove USINT, cut food sales to our people and do away with the Migration
Agreement, then it should do so without inventing them or attempting to
perpetuate its gross and cowardly provocations, which did not come from Cuba,
but from USINT, which has become a bastion, headquarters and bank for the
mercenaries and a center for supplying subversive materials smuggled in their
diplomatic pouches. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> could peacefully do without all of that,
and everything else that interventionism and aggression entails. It would not
shed a single tear at its departure. There is no need to burn papers, the
monstrosity of their content notwithstanding. Our Revolution would never assault
or break into a diplomatic office. It never has and it never will. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
