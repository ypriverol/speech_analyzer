<p ALIGN="CENTER">REMARKS BY DR. FIDEL CASTRO RUZ, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CUBA, AT
THE INFORMATION ROUND TABLE ORGANIZED BY YOUTHS AND STUDENTS ON MARCH 29, 2000</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologize if for the third time in three days I find it necessary to
say something here.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, they had to show on screen what they did not want to show.
They were certainly ashamed to show something like that but today they had no other
choice. We can easily understand the decision they made yesterday because that dialogue
and those questions they asked the child are a really sickening and disgusting display.
However, I will not abound on that, I will rather leave it to the experts on the subject.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Look, today is the day. Everything has happened today and it is not
over, yet. At this moment, the INS people are still in that meeting with the lawyers and
the extended family and they have failed to reach a decision, at least, that we know of.
As I said yesterday, the logic goes that they will comply, that they have to comply. Mr.
Pertierra, attorney at law, has indicated the same thing. But, as they live there in such
fear and hysteria, nothing is known until information is released on the discussions.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Still, there is something very significant. See that they are so
helpless now, that they can only resort to a deceitful action, that is, to say that the
father does not care for his son. They talk lightly about that as if there were not a
thousand dangers stalking the father in Miami. They have completely forgotten what
happened with the grandmothers. They seem to forget that even the police and the mayors
there act in contempt of the Federal Government.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A trip by Juan Miguel to the Mafia territory would require, at least,
the involvement of a battalion from the 82<sup>nd</sup> Airborne Division to protect him.
But, that is not the key to this matter.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Juan Miguel is not afraid nor has he ever been afraid. I say this
because I know him quite well. Theirs was a different trap: they would resort to anything,
they have said so, to subpoena him, as they wanted to do with his child, to testify before
a Congressional committee. This is the only great mistake they have avoided, but if they
did it, an individual there would soon decide whether or not he could return because from
the moment he is subpoenaed he must obey and it would be a violation of the law not to
comply or to return to Cuba without their permission. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But Juan Miguel is not afraid of even that, just as the grandmothers
were not afraid. They were willing to offer testimony and to tell them all the truths that
should be said to those who in that Committee are capable of such brutal, arbitrary and
wild actions. That is the truth, there is no fear. It only happens that we have never done
what they would like for us to do. Well, then, I shall now get right down to the issue.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the round table proceeded, I was listening, taking notes and
asking Carlitos to communicate over the telephone with various comrades, particularly,
Juan Miguel. Actually, for the first time since I have been attending these debates, I
also went aside to talk on the phone with Juan Miguel before making the decision to ask
for a few minutes tonight to make these remarks. It will not take long; it is a short
statement which I have already written down.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Miami Mafia and the American extreme right have let all the beasts
loose in the lot. The mayors in the service of the Miami Mafia have revolted. By the way,
there is so much talk about the mayors but they are all from the same area in the city.
The lawmakers who respond to the interests of that Mafia have been making moves and
putting all kinds of pressure for an out-of-courts solution. They are trying to pass some
sort of resolution or Act to take this case out of the courts, which to begin with have no
legal right to consider this case because it does not correspond to the U.S. courts to
decide on the issue. However, you see what is happening.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had been planning for some time, together with Juan Miguel and
Elián's grandparents, the father's trip to the United States while we waited for the
right time to do it properly and with adequate guarantees against any absurd trick aimed
at hurting him.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During this round table I have been in constant communication with Juan
Miguel and his family and we have agreed, just today because we find this is the right
moment, to release the following information:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Juan Miguel González, Elián's father, is ready to immediately travel
to the United states to assume custody of his son, as the child's father with full rights
recognized by the INS and Judge Moore, accompanied by indispensable people according to
the criteria of medical doctors, psychiatrists and psychologists. Together, the would
forthwith undertake the child's recuperation and his reinsertion to the family and school
environment while case unfolds in the Atlanta Court of Appeals.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact is that it is now said that the process would last one and a
half month, at least, and that is precisely what the INS is discussing today with the
lawyers and the extended family. The INS is demanding from these people a pledge that when
the court gives its ruling they will abide by such decision but they have so far refused
to do even that and at this moment they are still resisting. Therefore, the purpose of the
trip would be to have the child under the father's custody until that court issues its
ruling on the case.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday, we heard concerns about how to resolve the problem of the
child's separation from the false mother; who would be receiving him and how he would be
reincorporated to his family. Then, we have found the perfect formula for his reinsertion,
I would even say the best formula, which our people will better understand after listening
to those dialogues between Elián and his father in the last few days. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have seen that despite all pressures he still reacts and sustains
such conversations with his father; he talks about his little brother, his cousin and the
others and certainly much more spontaneously than the awful things we just saw on
television: &quot;Look, you want to go to Cuba or you would rather have your father come
here to stay with you&quot;, they said to him. The child was not interested until he grew
tired of all that and said: &quot;Well, don't ask me more questions.&quot; This increases
our hopes that there are true possibilities for this child to recuperate, mostly if
something is done promptly. It is due to that time pressure that we are now making this
statement.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Juan Miguel would be accompanied by his wife and Elián's little
brother who is six months old and of whom he speaks with great affection because he loves
his brother despite the fact that when he left the baby was hardly three months old. By
the way, this is a very lively six-months-old. Also traveling with them would be a very
dear cousin of Elián, 12 first-grade classmates chosen among his closest friends and
among them, of course, Hanser, the boy who shared his school desk; also his teacher who
cried so much those first days after the tragedy for the loss of her student and the
sadness of his classmates and his kindergarten teacher who had previously worked with him
for a whole year and knows him very well; the neonatologist who cared for him from birth,
a team of psychiatrists, psychologists, pediatricians and others as well as an advisor who
is familiar with the American legal and political system.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of this action is not only to preserve the child's health,
as you have rightly indicated, but also to facilitate the resumption of his education so
that he can pass the school tests and move to second grade.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now they are keeping him confined to the house with a visiting teacher
and, according to news we have received, there is much noise there. Just today he
complained to his father that many cars stop by the house making noise and sounding their
horns. It must be hell for him that he is not even attending school.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our proposal is that we take his classroom to him there, with is
classmates, his teachers and the most outstanding specialists to take care of him. At the
moment, we do not know who is taking care of him.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Juan Miguel, his wife and baby, and the children will be accommodated
at the residence of the head of our Interests Section in Washington, Mr. Fernando Remírez
de Estenoz. We only need to make the necessary arrangements with attorney Gregory Craig
with whom we are keeping in touch. Mr. Craig talks every day with Juan Miguel and comrade
Alarcón since when it was decided to retain that talented lawyer for certain undertakings
he asked for the possibility to analyze with Alarcón the technicalities involved in the
actions he would have to address in common agreement with Juan Miguel. So, there are daily
communications between that lawyer, Juan Miguel and Alarcón. Quite often the need arises
to interpret legal matters with which Juan Miguel is not familiar and then Alarcón helps
him.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the moment, certain details of the trip are still pending although
this is something that we had been discussing. Anyway, we will apply for the U.S.
government visas as soon as Mr.Craig has been able to make the necessary arrangements.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only thing left before departure would be the assurances the
American authorities would have to give us about their readiness to surrender custody of
the child to his father or to do their utmost to obtain it. If the latter were true, their
departure would have to wait for the outcome of such special efforts as would certainly be
required.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an example of how everything can be solved, that is, the
creation of the best possible conditions for the boy's reinsertion. In other words, we are
offering to carry Cardenas to Washington, symbolically that is, by taking there the people
closer to Elián both in kindergarten and first grade until the time when he was taken
away from that environment. I would say that even the school desks can be taken by plane,
at least the famous desk shared by Hanser and Elián could be taken on the plane for them
to use at the residence.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have consulted Remírez about his residence and he has said to have
enough space in a meeting room area on the first floor. There, they can have the classroom
and create in the house the proper conditions for the doctors to do their work. I am not
saying that they will all fit in Remírez' house but other officials live in the area.
Perhaps the adults will have to live somewhere else but there is plenty of space in the
house to work in an orderly fashion and for the family and children to accommodate. All
conditions can be created for the permanent presence of a doctor and a nurse, that is, for
medical care and education in the residence.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will be a small school and a small hospital. And, of course, if this
took a month, a month and a half or two months these will be optimum conditions and I
wonder who could challenge such arrangements. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the old saying goes: If the mountain does not come to Mohamed, then
Mohamed goes to the mountain. These would be perfectly ideal conditions that the child
does not have where he is now surrounded as he is by rogues, noise, cameras and such
disgraceful situations as we have been watching today. We are really pleased that they
decided to show that, for we have been able to see it.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This offer would be our contribution to the solution of this
predicament because all you can see there is a chaotic situation, a crime committed in
daylight. However, the best and the ideal conditions can be created to care for the child.
Of course, the children would not be prisoners there, neither would be Juan Miguel and his
family. We hope their visa would allow them to visit interesting places in Washington.
There are interesting places there like Capitol Hill --well, from a distance-- and the
Lincoln Memorial. I have heard that there are many interesting places in Washington and
its surrounding. They would not have to stay like in a small prison there. No, the
residence will be their school and living quarters.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Listen, do you not think it is better to thus facilitate the child's
rendezvous with his father? And this is a father whose love for his son nobody doubts; he
is a particularly dotting father. There is also the love of Juan Miguel's wife for this
child to whom she was very close, and his little brother that he loved; also the cousin
who was his playmate and 12 of his closest school friends.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Allow me to say that when we talked to the children's parents a few
days ago, the 12 couples who are the parents of the 12 children did not hesitate to given
their consent for their children's trip accompanied by their teacher. They are not hearing
this for the first time now, they have known it for some time, their passports are ready
and they have been provided shoes, clothing, everything. And the plane, of course, is
ready. They would leave as soon as the lawyer says that all the arrangements have been
made. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will add something else: some of the people here tonight would also
travel so you had better not count them in for tomorrow. They are ready although the
decision has yet to be made. Perhaps, some of them would speak to us from there and let us
know about Elián's health and mood. Under no circumstances would we do any of the awful
things that those relatives over there have been doing and use the boy for propaganda.
Absolutely not.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already said that nobody will mobilize when the child arrives.
Only his family will be waiting to welcome him home. The doctors will say whether he needs
to spend a few days here and when he should go back to his school because it is not the
same thing a small 12 students' school than his big school in Cardenas.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undoubtedly, not only the people in the school but all the people in
Cardenas will need certain preparation to properly deal with this new situation. But, this
formula seems to us to be perfect to allow time for the boy's adaptation.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Presently, the solution is in the hands of the United States
government. We hope that they have not promised to those individuals, just to please them,
that the child will remain in that hell for that month and a half or two months, I mean,
if they decide to take the case to the Supreme Court, although they would have a hazardous
road to trail. At the moment, they are forcing the government's hand as they usually
operate on the basis of force and blackmail; they definitely want to force the
government's hand.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They are talking about bringing the boy to Cuba but there is no need to
bring him back to Cuba immediately, absolutely not. As there is no need to demonstrate at
the airport, either.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that notorious press conference they spoke about walls; we shall see
which walls they have in mind. Possibly, they were referring to a wall here but the wall
is really there and it opens up only to receive those who break the law putting at risk so
many people's lives. People are perishing at that artificial wall they have raised there
with illegal formulas like those leading the child over that wall where non of his rights
have been respected.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, Juan Miguel and even the children in Elián's school
are willing to jump over that wall, legally and constructively, to save Elián.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have made reference to guarantees. These Cubans will have the same
guarantees that Imperatori had: the morale, the rightfulness, the law, the truth and also
the guarantee provided by the immunity of our Interests Section in Washington. Once there,
we shall see what happens and if they want to use force to have anybody do something.
Perhaps, it occurs to them to invite somebody to a Committee. Anyway, that would be their
problem and not the problem of those they invite because I am sure that if Juan Miguel
were invited to one of those tricky hearings, there would be plenty of decent lawmakers
and people willing to accompany him, and so would his advisor. As I say, if that were the
case they would be inviting their own headache because there is nothing they could fairly
use against these people.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Juan Miguel cannot be jailed there because he and his children would be
accompanied by 11 million Cubans and 11 million Cubans cannot be easily jailed. It would
be such an insanity that I do not believe such a risk even exists.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall see what they have to say about this offer that would allow
for the recognition of the boy's rights and the possibility for him to be reunited with he
people who were with him from birth, who have been rearing him and teaching him to draw.
And look how amazing the boy's drawings are, an ability he acquired in kindergarten. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we could see here is just a sample of the excellence of education
in our country, the excellence of our teacher's work and their disposition not only to
educate but even to give their lives for one of their students with that fraternal spirit
that the parents of the other children have also exhibited. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely, the children will be happy to be reunited with Elián and so
neither the U.S. government nor anyone else would have to worry that the child be sent to
Cuba which for them is hell. It would actually be there, under the Washington sky, that
the reunification would take place albeit with his teachers, his doctors, his
psychologists and his classmates to prevent that child from continuing to get sick and for
him to immediately begin recuperating his health.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is Juan Miguel and his family's statement that I have read here on
behalf of our people. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(APPLAUSE)</p>
