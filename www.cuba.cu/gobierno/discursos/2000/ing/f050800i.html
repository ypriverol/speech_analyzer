<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>SPEECH DELIVERED
BY DR. FIDEL CASTRO RUZ, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CUBA, AT
THE COMMEMORATION OF THE 47</b><sup><b>TH</b></sup><b>
ANNIVERSARY OF THE JULY 26, 1953 ATTACK ON THE MONCADA GARRISON
HELD IN THE PROVISIONAL REVOLUTION SQUARE OF PINAR DEL RIO.
AUGUST 5, 2000</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">People of Pinar del Río;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Fellow countrymen of Cuba;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Distinguished guests:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Our neighbor, the empire, is living
election time. Everybody knows by now who are the candidates to
the presidency of the government of the United States, our
stubborn, arrogant and overbearing adversary. During the long,
hard struggle for the return of the kidnapped boy we were able to
learn about all the contenders for this coveted position. Not a
single one of them had the decency or the sense of justice to
support the rights of the boy and his father. Desperately
pandering the Cuban-American annexationist mob for their few
votes and, particularly, for their abundant funds, they supported
the kidnappers or shamelessly encouraged the defection of the
father, who is a humble, honest and incorruptible Cuban worker. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Under certain historical circumstances
there have been candidates in the United States with deep
convictions like Lincoln, with the wisdom of a statesman like
Roosevelt during truly difficult times for his country and the
world, or the ethics born of sincere religious beliefs of a man
like Carter, who was perhaps worthy of better luck in the face of
the galloping inflation brought about by the misadventure of the
Vietnam War and the energy crisis. Those personalities have
aroused great interest both within the United States and abroad.
But perhaps never before, in times as complex and chaotic as
these facing humanity today, has there been two such boring and
colorless candidates, so totally devoid of background history and
sound views and principles as those competing today for
leadership in the sole hegemonic superpower of our unipolar and
globalized world. They even lack Clinton&#146;s sincere concern
over certain social issues, his intellectual shrewdness and
personal culture, despite his hesitations and errors. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Regardless of who wins the presidency, he
will control deadly weapons and have direct command of the
suitcase carrying the nuclear codes. He will be the master of war
and peace in the world, much more powerful than any emperor in
ancient Rome.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In the United States, the final stage of
the political contest begins when one of the candidates controls
the majority of delegates from one of the two main factions
prevailing in that country&#146;s political system where hundreds
of millions of dollars are usually invested. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">First comes the ritual of choosing a vice
president. Of course, the candidate based on purely electoral
interests and tactics chooses him. Then comes the pompous
presidential nomination ceremony, and nothing less than an
alleged government platform without the slightest value as a
mandate or as a standard for ethical or political conduct. It is
usually a simple summary of moods, group interests, shady deals,
posturing and phrases intended to sweetening the ears of one
voting sector or another, in the midst of a ferocious battle
where each side tries to balance the accusations of being too
liberal or too conservative that the two factions throw at each
other. No one should expect sincerity, a sense of responsibility
for the country or the world, or the slightest reflection of
profound knowledge, genuine political culture or awareness of the
serious problems facing humanity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The so-called Republican Convention has
just come to an end. It was held in none other than the city of
Philadelphia, home to the famous 1776 Declaration of
Independence. Actually, while those slaveholders who rebelled
against the British colonial rule did not abolish the disgraceful
practice of slavery --which remained in effect for almost a whole
century longer, and racial discrimination is still very deeply
rooted in American society-- they were after all the bearers of
the most advanced political ideas of the time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We recently witnessed how the mere idea of
creating an antimissile shield in violation of major
international agreements aroused a significant international
reaction. Yet, the first announcement made at the Republican
Convention just held in Philadelphia under the leadership of the
party&#146;s illustrious candidate was the plan to considerably
raise the military budget for research and development, and the
construction of an antimissile shield to cover the entire nation
with a radar network that could detect enemy missiles en route to
U.S. territory and shoot them down in mid-air.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Those holding these views are unable to
understand that such a policy would meet with the overwhelming
opposition of the rest of the world, including Europe. That, like
a magnet, it would bring together all those nations threatened by
a strategy that would leave them helpless against the United
States. A new, dangerous and extremely costly arms race would
immediately follow and nothing could prevent the proliferation of
nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The authors of the plan know very well that
slightly more than half the American people, who are still
confused and insufficiently informed about this complex issue,
believe that to be the most suitable solution in the interest of
the country&#146;s peace and security. However, the adoption of
this extreme position by the Republican candidate vis à vis any
other more sensible or reasonable proposal from his opponent
would present him to voters as the strong, farsighted, tough guy
that the United States needs to confront all imaginary or real
dangers. This is the good news they sent out from Philadelphia to
all of the peoples on Earth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">What does this smart platform have to offer
Latin America and the Caribbean in particular? There is a phrase
that says it all: &quot;The next American century should include
all of the Americas.&quot; This simple statement means no less
than the proclamation of the United States&#146; right of
ownership over Latin America and the Caribbean.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It later adds, &quot;In concert with the
Congress, (the president) will work with key democracies like
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and --above all-- Mexico.&quot; They do
not specify if that American century will include Pinochet-like
governments or military juntas like the one in Argentina, which
vanished tens of thousands of people after a series of coups
d&#146;état promoted by previous Republican administrations that
maintained close cooperation with those brutally repressive
regimes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Particularly striking is the phrase that
reads: &quot;...and </font><font face="Courier New">--</font><font
face="Arial">above all--</font><font face="Courier New"> </font><font
face="Arial">Mexico&quot; since that is a country they robbed of
half its territory through an unjustifiable, expansionist war.
Their obvious intent is to begin with the economic annexation and
full political subordination of that country to the United States
and then do likewise with the rest of the countries in our
region, imposing a free trade agreement essentially favorable to
U.S. interests, from which not even the tiniest Caribbean island
could escape. They mean, of course, the free circulation of
capital and commodities, not the people! The United States does
not intend to be full of indigenous people, blacks or mestizos;
not even full of white Latin Americans because they are not of
pure Aryan blood, and none can escape the suspicion of carrying
distant genes from the genome of another human race. Neither the
Ku Klux Klan nor the other passionate and increasingly numerous
admirers of the swastika would permit it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As expected, the highly biased Philadelphia
platform devotes a substantial part of its section on Latin
America to Cuba. According to the wire services it reads:
&quot;Our economic and political relations will change when the
Cuban regime frees all political prisoners, legalizes peaceful
protest, allows opposition political activity, permits free
expression, and commits to democratic elections.&quot; For the
authors of this demagogic abomination, freedom and democracy mean
an outdated, corrupt system in which it is money alone that
decides and elects, and in which a presidential candidate is
nominated, with lightning speed, as the heir to a vacant throne
only on account of his father&#146;s powerful influence and the
millions of dollars in donations from those expecting major
privileges from the new leader. That is really light-years away
from what the country&#146;s founding fathers dreamed of over two
centuries ago. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Another wire story reports that: &quot;The
platform, aside from active support for the enemies of the
Revolution, includes the broadcasting of news from the United
States to the Caribbean nation.&quot; That is, they intend to
keep up with the filth spewed against Cuba by subversive radio
stations located in U.S. territory; they will persist in the
outrageous use of the name of José Martí --a name that is
glorious and sacred to our people-- in official U.S. government
broadcasts directed against Cuba.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Yet, another wire story reports that
&quot;the members of the Florida delegation said at a press
conference that the final wording of the declaration was the
result of the work of the representatives of the state that is
home to the main enclave of the Cuban-American vote in the United
States, which is predominantly Republican.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At the press conference, the hysterical
Díaz-Balart euphorically squealed, &quot;This is unprecedented
language. Never before has the Republican Party made such a broad
commitment.&quot; They cannot forget the enormous and crushing
defeat sustained by the Cuban-American mob recently, one from
which it will never recover.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Meanwhile, Ileana Ross, the ferocious
she-wolf who wrapped Elián in the Stars and Stripes flag,
jubilantly declared that the Republican&#146;s is &quot;the party
that promotes democracy.&quot; This is a lie! This is an utter,
shameless lie! There are Republicans who promote even fascism but
there are also many decent Republicans who do not share or
support the extremist right-wing &quot;democracy&quot; this woman
believes in, that of terrorists and lawbreakers capable of
kidnapping, tormenting and politically exploiting an innocent
six-year-old boy for months.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">According to a wire story sent out from
Philadelphia on July 31, the Republican Party platform holds that
&quot;the United States, under the presidency of George Bush,
should strengthen the policy against Cuba with active support of
dissidents on the island.&quot; It then goes on: &quot;Although
the platform basically maintains the same policy, it makes clear
their open support for the opponents of Fidel Castro.&quot; This
is good, really excellent! There will be absolutely no need to
prove what everyone in our country knows so well: that is, the
mercenary and traitorous nature of the tiny counterrevolutionary
groups working in our country on the empire&#146;s payroll. Their
clumsy masters are heedless of the fact that after the seven
months of unrelenting battle waged by our people against the
repugnant misdeeds of the Miami annexationist mob and the U.S.
extreme right, the members of these groups have been left like
fish out of water.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;U.S. policy toward Cuba should be
based upon sound, [...] principles,&quot; states the section on
Cuba in the chapter entitled Neighborhood of the Americas. It
takes a lot of nerve to use the words &quot;sound
principles&quot; to describe the gases emanating from the
stinking sewer of the Miami terrorist and mercenary mob! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To top off the mountain of garbage
contained in the Republican platform, it is finally stated:
&quot;Republicans believe that the United States should adhere to
the principles established by the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act,
which recognizes the rights of Cuban refugees fleeing communist
tyranny.&quot; Excellent! There will be no need to explain much
further to the Cuban people the reasons for the Oath of Baraguá
and the need to continue, without rest or respite, our struggle
against the narrow-minded policy reiterated against Cuba. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The prestige of the imperial policy will so
crumble that not even its dust will remain. We will
systematically denounce and demolish one by one, its hypocrisy
and lies. They obviously have absolutely no idea what kinds of
people have been forged in these 40 years of Revolution. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Our message will reach all corners of the
Earth, and our struggle will serve as an example. The world, ever
more ungovernable, will fight until hegemony and the subjugation
of peoples become totally unsustainable. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Whoever is elected leader of the empire
should not ignore that Cuba demands the total removal of the
murderous Cuban Adjustment Act and the criminal pieces of
legislation that bear the notorious names of Torricelli and
Helms-Burton as well as the genocidal blockade and economic war.
It should be noted that those who have authored, promoted and
enforced these laws and policies are guilty of the crime of
genocide, as defined and condemned by international treaties
signed by both the United States and Cuba. Also that, our nation
being the aggrieved party, the Cuban courts has jurisdiction over
these matters. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">They must not forget that although no
lawsuits have been filed so far demanding compensation for moral
damage </font><font face="Courier New">--</font><font
face="Arial">and this compensation could be substantial-- the
U.S. government already owes the Cuban people over 300 billion
dollars for the human damage resulting from its mercenary
invasion by the Bay of Pigs, its dirty war and many other crimes,
and for the economic ravages caused by the blockade. This claim
is based on firm rulings issued after absolutely legal
proceedings pursued in a court of law to which the U.S.
authorities, out of arrogance and moral cowardice, did not even
deign to send their representatives. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">They should not entertain any illusion
regarding Cuba&#146;s stance if relations between the United
States and our country ever become as normal as those currently
existing with other socialist countries like China and Vietnam.
We will not remain silent in the face of any crime, aggression or
injustice committed against other peoples. Our battle of ideas
will not cease as long as the current imperialist, hegemonic and
unipolar system is still in place and remains a scourge of
humanity and a mortal threat to the survival of our species. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A growing number of millions of Americans
are becoming aware of the horrors of the economic and political
order imposed on the world. Those who have been able thus far to
manipulate human destinies as they see fit can no longer even
meet in Seattle or Washington to promote their dirty policies in
the WTO or the International Monetary Fund because a growing
number of thousands and tens of thousands of Americans have taken
to the streets near their meeting places in protest despite a
brutal repression with methods of violence and hate that are
reminiscent of Hitler&#146;s assault troops or Pinochet&#146;s
ferocious police force.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Cuban Revolution does not merely
confide in the moral integrity and patriotic and revolutionary
spirit of its people, and in the survival instinct of the human
species, whose very existence is threatened. It also believes and
confides in the traditional idealism of the American people that
can only be led into unjust wars and shameful aggressions on the
basis of vulgar deceit. Once demagoguery and lies are definitely
exposed and defeated, the world will find excellent allies in the
American people. This is what happened in the case of the
repugnant war that cost the lives of millions of Vietnamese and
over 50,000 young Americans. A more recent example is the
American people noble support of a little boy and a Cuban family,
victims of a brutal crime perpetrated by a band of criminals who,
after having taken advantage of that country&#146;s hospitality,
ended up showing their hatred and frustration by trampling and
burning the U.S. flag. That has never happened in revolutionary
Cuba, despite the blockade and the crimes committed against our
people by successive U.S. administrations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba must
be unilateral because the U.S. leaders have unilaterally imposed
the blockade and economic war against Cuba. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Fellow countrymen:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Pinar del Río was the poorest province in
Cuba before the triumph of the Revolution. Its lands were the
property of big landowners. In no other province of our country
did sharecroppers and tenant farmers pay such high rents for the
use of those lands. Many had to turn over at least 30% of their
crops. Pinar del Río was once known as the Cinderella of Cuba.
As I told you on another occasion, a medical student once said to
me, years after the triumph of the Revolution, &quot;It
isn&#146;t Cinderella anymore; now it&#146;s the princess.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The 16 poorly run health care centers,
which provided medical care with around 100 private practices,
have raised to 125.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The 248 doctors, 25 dentists and 50 nurses
and assistants became 3473 doctors, 569 dentists and 5702 nurses
and assistants, who provide services that are free of charge to
the entire population.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The infant mortality rate of 60.5 per 1000
live births became 6.5, a rate lower than that of the United
States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The average life expectancy rose from 53 to
76.5 years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The illiteracy rate of 30% among people
over 10 years of age is now practically 0%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The average level of schooling has gone
from second grade to ninth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The 1710 teachers became 18,816. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">An education budget of five or six million
pesos grew to 113 million.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The number of women who are university
graduates rose from 33 to 22,940.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The number of university-graduate
professionals rose from 541 to 46,500.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The number of cultural institutions rose
from 25 to 171.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The number of sports facilities rose from
42 to 604.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Unemployment dropped from 30% to 4%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have limited myself to just a few figures
related to social features of great importance to the lives of
human beings: health, education, culture, sports and employment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Its universities, its scientific
institutions with over 200 PhDs and Masters in science, its
hospitals, its sports and recreational facilities, its elders'
homes and the full social security of its people have transformed
the human face of what was once the Cinderella of Cuba. The same
thing has happened throughout the whole country, from Punta de
Maisí to Cabo de San Antonio. No other people in the world have
achieved such progress in such a short time while facing constant
aggression, blockade and economic warfare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There has not been a single political
assassination, a single execution without due process, a single
person vanished or tortured throughout these 41 years of
Revolution in Cuba. However, these things still happen in many
parts of the world, including the United States. All of our
fellow countrymen know this, even preschool children.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Almost half of our Parliament is made up of
constituency delegates nominated and elected by local residents,
with no interference whatsoever from the Party. Municipal
assemblies, made up by the respective constituency delegates in
every municipality nominate all of the members of this supreme
state body. All of the members of our Parliament, which in turn
elects the nation&#146;s executive and judicial powers, must be
elected, without exception, by over 50% of those who exercise
their right to direct vote by secret ballot. No guns are used to
guard the voting stations; the ballot boxes are protected by our
children with the same efficiency they showed in protecting the
U.S. Interests Section during the combative marches and massive
demonstrations held in its vicinity, when not a single window was
ever broken.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">However, imperialism calls everything I
have mentioned here a violation of human rights. As a result, the
country that has carried out this tremendous human feat is the
victim of a blockade, hostility and a thousand other forms of
aggression. Due to the achievement of such lofty advances, we are
now the only nation in the world subjected to such ferocious
harassment by the government of the United States, which is the
wealthiest, the mightiest and the sole superpower in the world
today.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">How vain are the hopes of those who have
just proclaimed the continuation of the cynical and criminal
policy I described at the beginning of my remarks! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">From here, from this province where the
Bronze Titan ultimately crowned, in Mantua, the colossal feat of
the invasion he had begun in Mangos de Baraguá, we say to them:
You ignorants! Do you not understand that Cuba is impregnable,
that its Revolution is indestructible, that its people will never
bow down or surrender? Do you not realize that our patriotism and
internationalism are as deeply rooted in our minds and hearts as
the imposing <b><i>mogotes</i></b> of Pinar del Río are in the
volcanic rocks of this part of an island that is called Cuba and
is surrounded today by the halo of having successfully endured
almost 42 years of blockade and aggression by the most formidable
power that ever existed?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We are defended by the strength of our
prestige and the example we have set, the indestructible steel
that is the justice of our cause, the inextinguishable fire of
our truth and our morale as well as the double trench of stone
and ideas that we have built which is unassailable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">That is why, Mr. Bush, if you finally
become the leader of what no longer is and can no longer be
called a republic but rather an empire, then, in the spirit of an
honest adversary, I suggest that you leave aside the euphoria and
fever of your Convention, and reconsider your position in order
to avoid the risk of becoming the tenth American president to
come and go watching with sterile and unnecessary bitterness a
Revolution that will not bow down or surrender and that can never
be destroyed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I am very much aware of what you have
recklessly told your close and indiscreet friends in the
Cuban-American mob: that you can solve the problem of Cuba very
easily, in clear reference to the methods used in the sinister
era when the Central Intelligence Agency was directly involved in
assassination plots against our country&#146;s leaders. Because I
do not share this narrow view of the role of individuals in
history, I urge you not to forget that for every one of the
revolutionary leaders you may decide to so remove, there are
millions of men and women in Cuba who are capable of taking their
places and altogether there are far more of them than you could
ever remove, or that your immense political, economic and
military power could ever defeat.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You, the people of Pinar del Río, have
earned the honor of hosting the commemoration of the 47<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of the July 26. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In the face of the cynical Philadelphia
platform, let us renew once again the oath we made in Baraguá:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;The Cuban Adjustment Act must end!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;The Helms-Burton Act must end!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;The Torricelli Act must end!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;The amendments smuggled into many
U.S. Congress laws in an attempt to aggravate our people&#146;s
suffering must end!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;The blockade as a whole and the
criminal economic warfare against Cuba must end!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;The threats, the subversive
campaigns, the destabilization plans must end!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;And in due time, given that it is not
a priority at this moment although it is an absolutely just right
that cannot be renounced, the illegally occupied territory of
Guantánamo must be returned to Cuba!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">And all of this unconditionally!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To the people of Pinar del Río we say
Congratulations!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To our fellow countrymen throughout Cuba we
say Patria o Muerte!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Venceremos!</font></p>
