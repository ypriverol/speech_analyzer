<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Speech delivered
by Dr. Fidel Castro Ruz, President of the Republic of Cuba, at
the Cuban solidarity rally held in Riverside Church, Harlem, New
York, September 8, 2000</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Dear sisters and brothers from the
Reception Committee;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Dear sisters and brothers present here;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Dear sisters and brothers in the nearby
room;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Dear sisters and brothers listening to us
from outside on the street, since many were not able to get into
this church hall:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You have been extremely generous and kind
to me.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When a few questions were posed here that
you responded associated to efforts we have made for the benefit
of our children and all our people and the efforts we have also
made for other children and other peoples in various parts of the
world --things which we never mention for there is no need to--
something occurred to me. I thought, all of this actually has a
name, and it is &quot;violation of human rights,&quot; (APPLAUSE
AND SHOUTS) which is used in an attempt to justify a blockade and
economic war that have now gone on for more than 40 years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Also, when you sang &quot;Happy
Birthday,&quot; it brought many things to mind, and it occurred
to me that perhaps it would have been more fitting to say,
&quot;Happy Good Luck, Fidel.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It is a miracle that I have lived this many
years (APPLAUSE AND SHOUTS), and not because we spent a number of
years fighting against the tyranny in our country, or for having
participated in some war actions but rather because of everything
that came after the triumph of the Revolution. They say that a
word to the wise is enough (APPLAUSE), and you are not only wise
but noble and intelligent, too.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">On my way here, I recalled my four visits
to the United Nations. The first time, I was thrown out of the
hotel near the United Nations. I had two choices: pitching a tent
in the United Nations courtyard --and as a guerrilla fighter who
had recently come down from the mountains, it would not have been
all that difficult for me (APPLAUSE)-- or heading for Harlem,
where I had been invited to stay in one of its hotels. (APPLAUSE)
I immediately decided: &quot;I will go to Harlem because that is
where my best friends are.&quot; (APPLAUSE AND SHOUTS)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">(SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE SHOUTS, &quot;My
house is your house.&quot;) (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Thank you very much. That is what they used
to say to me in many beautiful homes where very wealthy people
lived. They had those little signs that read exactly like that.
Later, when we did something to help the poor they definitely
removed the signs. (APPLAUSE) However, in you I can sense the
generosity of the humble.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When I came back the second time, in 1979,
I do not remember right now exactly what I did; all I remember is
that I spoke there on behalf of all the poor countries of the
world. The third time I came back to Harlem, and not only to
Harlem, but also to the Bronx (APPLAUSE), as someone said here
tonight.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This time I have been honored with an
invitation to this neighborhood that I believe is called
Riverside. Is that right? (SOMEONE ANSWERS, &quot;Yes.&quot;)
From what I can understand, I am beside a river (LAUGHTER); but
at the same time, I am in the middle of a river, a river of the
purest and loftiest friendship. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I am sure you can understand that it is not
easy for me to visit New York; there is more than enough proof of
that. This time it was definitely not easy, and many of my
compatriots were very worried. We are living in a special period,
and I do not mean the special period in Cuba, which has been
brought about by the double blockade, but rather the special
period of presidential elections. (LAUGHTER) And I have received
all kinds of threats, from killing me to sending me to a U.S.
prison.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">However, that was a very important meeting.
They called it the Millenium Summit, and we truly are beginning a
millenium full of uncertainties. What&#146;s more, for those of
us who believe that the 20<sup>th</sup> century ends this
December 31, humanity is about to begin the 21<sup>st</sup>
century in extremely difficult and extremely troubling
conditions. I could not fail to attend for any reason, and
believe me when I say that I felt very happy when I got on the
plane, after the complicated procedures needed to obtain a visa.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As you know, comrade Alarcón came here
with us. (APPLAUSE AND SHOUTS) He was supposed to attend a
conference of chairmen or Speakers of legislative assemblies or
Parliaments from all countries in the world. He had applied for a
visa almost a month earlier and been turned down, but was finally
granted a visa at the same time as me --since he was part of the
summit delegation-- around 24 or 48 hours before the trip. I
should add that I have been treated very well at all times and
that the U.S. security staff assigned to us have been very
cordial and highly efficient, so it is only right to acknowledge
this. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We were given five minutes to speak at the
meeting. As I am sure you understand, that is very little time to
address encyclopedic problems or rather an encyclopedic list of
problems, but I did my homework and managed to speak for only
seven minutes and three seconds. (APPLAUSE) I ended up as one of
those who spoke the least. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have come here tonight after having gone
through this training (SHOUTS), but I know that you will allow me
more than seven minutes and three seconds. (APPLAUSE AND SHOUTS)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I draped a handkerchief over the little
lights that signal the time, and I did it for two reasons.
Firstly, it was a sort of protest against the fact that Heads of
State and Government are subjected to the torture of a yellow
light coming on first and then a red light to signal that their
five minutes are over; nothing happens after that but it is
humiliating. Secondly, I did it because I do not think that the
speakers podium at the United Nations should be turned into a
traffic light. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Of course, because there are so many
speakers the time should be limited so as to reduce the many
inconveniences caused to the city of New York by staying gathered
here for a week or even two weeks. Still, one would suppose that
they are not preschool children, and so if things are told and
explained to them, they can be very brief.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have taken part in many meetings with
very short time limits. There are always some who talk for far
longer than the time allotted, with or without traffic lights. I
have always tried to comply with the time-limit because the worst
punishment for those who go on for too long is the restlessness
of those waiting for their turn, and no matter how interesting
the things they are saying may be, people will criticize them. It
is not advisable to speak at length in that kind of meetings.
Now, although we are not at the United Nations I intend to limit
myself to some basic issues.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Why did I say that, in my view, that was a
very important meeting? Because the world is suffering a truly
catastrophic situation. Do not believe those experts who feign
optimism, or those who ignore what is really happening in the
world. I have irrefutable statistics about the situation in the
Third World, in the countries where many of you come from, or
countries that have been visited by many Americans where
three-quarters of humanity live. I have brought a few papers
along and chosen various statistics, which I will read.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I could say, for example, that in more than
100 countries, the per capita income is lower than it was 15
years ago.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In the Third World, there are 1.3 billion
poor people. In other words, one out of every three inhabitants
lives in poverty.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">More than 820 million people in the world
suffer from hunger; and 790 million of them live in the Third
World.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">More than 840 million adults are still
illiterate and the vast majority live in the Third World.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At the moment of birth, an inhabitant of
the Third World can expect to live 18 years less than another of
the industrialized world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa is
barely 48 years. That is 30 years less than in the developed
countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It is estimated that 654 million people
living in countries of the South today will not live past 40
--almost half my age.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A full 99.5% of all maternal deaths take
place in the Third World. The risk of maternal death in Europe is
one death per 1400 births. In Africa the risk is one in six. I
use the word risk because the number of those who actually die is
lower, of course. But the number of mothers who die in Africa for
every 10,000 births is no less than 100 times higher than the
number in Europe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">More than 11 million boys and girls under
five years of age die every year in the Third World from diseases
that are largely preventable. That means more than 30,000 every
day, 21 every minute, and almost a thousand since this rally
began, about 45 minutes ago. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In the Third World, 64 children out of
every 1000 born live die before reaching one year of age. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Two out of every five children in the Third
World suffer from retarded growth, and one in every three is
underweight for their age.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I said 64 out of every 1000 as an average
for all the Third World countries, and that includes Cuba whose
infant mortality rate is slightly under seven. But, there are
numerous countries in Africa where more than 200 children out of
every 1000 live births die every year before the age of five.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There are other terribly painful moral
aspects such as the fact that two million girls are forced into
prostitution and about 250 million children under the age of 15
are forced to work for a living.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Ten of the 11 new HIV positives occurring
in the world every minute take place in sub-Saharan Africa, where
the total number of people infected is now over 25 million.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">And all of this is happening at a time
when, throughout the world, 800 billion dollars are put into
military spending, 400 billion are spent on narcotic drugs, and a
trillion dollars are invested in commercial advertising.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">By the end of 1998, the Third World&#146;s
external debt amounted to 2.4 trillion dollars, that is, four
times the total in 1982, only 18 years ago. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Between 1982 and 1998, these countries paid
over 3.4 trillion dollars for debt servicing, in other words,
almost a trillion dollars more than the current debt. Far from
decreasing, the debt grew by 45% in those 16 years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Despite the neoliberal discourse on the
opportunities created by the open-trading system the
underdeveloped countries, with 85% of the world&#146;s
population, accounted for only 34.6% of world exports in 1998.
That is less than in 1953, despite the fact that their population
has more than doubled. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">While flows of official development
assistance in 1992 represented 0.33% of the developed
countries&#146; gross national product, by 1998, six years later,
that percentage had dropped to 0.23%, far below the 0.7% goal set
by the United Nations. Therefore, while the wealthy world is
becoming increasingly wealthy, contributions to the development
of the large number of poor people decrease every year.
Solidarity and responsibility shrink further by the year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">On the other hand, the daily volume of the
currency buying and selling transactions has reached a sum of
approximately 1.5 trillion dollars. This figure does not include
operations involving the so-called financial derivatives, which
account for an almost equal additional sum. That is, some three
trillion dollars worth of speculative operations are carried out
every day. If a 1% tax were charged on all speculative
operations, the amount raised would be more than enough for a
sustainable development, with the necessary protection of nature
and the environment in the so-called developing countries.
Actually, these countries are headed down the path of growing and
visible underdevelopment, since the gap between the rich and the
poor countries is wider every day, as is the difference between
the rich and the poor within countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I could ask you, for example, whether
adding up the savings that all of you may have in the bank, big
or small, would amount to even a thousandth of the wealth of the
richest man in the world who, by the way, happens to be a citizen
of this country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I mentioned trillions of dollars in
speculative operations every day: 3 trillion dollars. What does
this have to do with world trade? All of the world trade as a
whole totals 6.5 trillion dollars a year, which means that every
two working days, speculative operations are realized on those
stock markets that you hear so much about amounting to
approximately the total of world trade operations in a year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When those stock markets were created, the
phenomena I have described did not exist. This is something
totally new, and genuinely absurd. Speculative operations in
which money is used to make money have absolutely nothing to do
with the creation of material goods or services. This is a
phenomenon that has developed uncontrollably over the last 30
years and is growing to ever more absurd heights every day. Can
this frantic gambling be called economy? Can the genuine economy
that should meet the vital needs of humankind withstand it?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Money is no longer used primarily in
investments for the production of goods; it is used in
currencies, stocks and financial derivatives in the desperate
pursuit of more money, directly, through the most sophisticated
computers and software and not through productive processes as
was historically the case. This is what the much trumpeted and
infamous process of neoliberal globalization has brought about.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The developed countries control 97% of all
the patents in the world, of course, they have monopolized the
finest minds on the planet. In the last 40 years, the
industrialized countries have taken a million professionals away
from Latin America and the Caribbean. I repeat, a million
professionals! In the United States it would have cost 200
billion dollars to train all these people. Thus, the poor
countries of the world supply the developed nations with the
finest fruits of their universities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I had some figures about this on a sheet of
paper around here somewhere. I spoke about this at a round table
in the United Nations. In the last 10 years, out of 22 Nobel
Prize Laureates in physics, the United States attracted 19 and
the same happens with Nobel prizes in medicine and other
sciences. While knowledge is considered a major asset for
development today, the Third World countries are constantly
deprived of their best talents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">One last statistic, from a few I chose:
barely 1% of the 56 billion dollars invested every year in
medical research is spent on research into pneumonia, diarrheic
diseases, tuberculosis and malaria, four of the primary scourges
of the underdeveloped world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The most advanced medicine used to add a
few years to the lives of those faced with the tragedy of being
HIV positives cost 10,000 dollars in the industrialized nations.
This is what they charge for them although the actual production
cost is approximately 1000 dollars.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We are well aware of the tragedies facing
the world because one of our most sacred principles is that of
solidarity. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Those who do not believe in humankind, in
its potential for noble sentiments, in its capacity for goodness
and altruism, will never understand that we do not only hurt for
every Cuban child who dies or suffers --we must not limit
ourselves to only those who die --but also for every child in
Haiti, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Africa and
every country in the world. (APPLAUSE) It cannot be claimed that
the human species has attained a maximum of consciousness while
it is incapable of hurting for the suffering of others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Actually, humanity will attain its maximum
of consciousness and potential qualities when people feel the
same sorrow for the death of any family&#146;s child as they
would for their own child or other close relative. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I know that many of you --perhaps the vast
majority-- are Christians, and we are gathered together in a
church. Well then, this is exactly what Christ preached, and this
is what &quot;Love thy neighbor&quot; means to us. (APPLAUSE)
This explains the efforts that Cuba has made for other countries
to the extent of its capabilities. Some of these things were
raised by you at the beginning of this rally.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There is a statistic that demonstrates this
spirit of solidarity: about half a million of our compatriots
have carried out internationalist missions in numerous countries
in different parts of the world, especially in Africa (APPLAUSE),
such as medical doctors, teachers, technicians, construction
workers or soldiers. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When many were investing in and trading
with racist and fascist South Africa, tens of millions of
voluntary soldiers from Cuba fought against the racist and
fascist soldiers. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Today, everyone speaks glowingly of the
preservation of Angola&#146;s independence, although the country
is still subjected to a brutal civil war. The fault lies with
those who supplied the armed bandits for many years, among them,
the apartheid government and other authorities whom I will not
name out of respect for where I am right now. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Those half million volunteers who carried
out their mission for free did not go there to invest in oil,
diamonds, minerals or in any of the country&#146;s other riches.
(APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Cuba does not have a single investment in
any of the countries where our internationalists fulfilled their
duty (APPLAUSE); it does not have a single dollar of capital
invested, and does not own a single square meter of land.
(APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Amílcar Cabral, a great African leader,
(APPLAUSE) once made a prophetic statement that was an
unforgettable honor for us: &quot;When the Cuban soldiers go
home, all they will take with them are the remains of their dead
comrades.&quot; (PROLONGED APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Nobody blockaded the obnoxious apartheid
regime. Nobody waged economic warfare against it. There were no
Torricelli or Helms-Burton Acts against that fascist and racist
regime. Yet, all these laws and measures have been adopted
against Cuba, a country that always has and always will be
dedicated to solidarity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Simply by reducing infant mortality in our
country from approximately 60 deaths per 1000 live births in the
first year of life to less than 7 per 1000, we have saved the
lives of hundreds of thousands of children. We have protected the
health of all children free of charge and guaranteed a life
expectancy of over 75 years. (APPLAUSE) Moreover, we have not
only preserved lives but also guaranteed free education for all
(APPLAUSE), and not a selfish and mediocre education but one
based on solidarity and excellence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A study carried out by UNESCO, a UN agency,
revealed that our children possess almost twice as much knowledge
as the average child in the rest of Latin America. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We have also saved the lives of hundreds
and hundreds of thousands of children in Africa and other parts
of the Third World throughout the years of the Revolution, and we
have provided health care for tens of millions of people. Over
25,000 health care workers have taken part in these
internationalist efforts. (APPLAUSE) This is called a
&quot;violation of human rights,&quot; and it is why we must be
destroyed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Our Revolution has a history. I would have
absolutely no moral right to be speaking here now if a single
Cuban had been murdered by the Revolution at some point
throughout these 40-plus years, if there were a single death
squad in Cuba, if a single person in Cuba had been vanished. And
I will go even further: if a single person in our country had
been tortured --mark my words-- if a single person had been
tortured in our country. And the Cuban people are very much aware
of this. (APPLAUSE AND SHOUTS) They are a rebellious people with
a very high sense of justice. They would not have forgiven us a
single one of the acts I have mentioned (APPLAUSE) and these
people have followed the Revolution throughout more than 40
years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Also, with exemplary courage they have
withstood 41 years of a blockade enforced by successive
governments of the most powerful country in the world in
political, economic, technological and military terms.
Furthermore, for the last 10 years, they have withstood the
double blockade that resulted from the collapse of the socialist
bloc and the USSR. We were left without markets and without a
source of supplies of food, fuel, raw materials and many other
essential products that we paid for with our earnings, and in
order to pay, of course, we needed to trade. If nobody buys
anything from a country, that country will not have anything with
which to buy from those who deprive it of earnings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Perhaps a day will come when history will
recount how Cuba worked the miracle of withstanding all of this
(APPLAUSE); but in the meantime, I can assure you that no other
country in Latin America and the Caribbean would have been able
to do it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This country, where we are right now, is
one of the few countries in the world that could be almost
totally self-sufficient in terms of the basic elements for
maintaining life. But, the same cannot be said of a small
isolated country, or a medium-sized country or even a large
country in Latin America. None would have been able to withstand
this for even two weeks, and we have withstood it for 10 years.
(APPLAUSE) And for several years now, little by little, we have
managed not only to survive but also to gradually increase our
economic production, although we have still not bounced back to
the rates we had before the double blockade that forced us into
what we call the special period. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Suffice it to say that a daily caloric
intake of 3000, more or less evenly spread, was reduced overnight
to 1800 calories. It now stands at around 2400 calories. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">But not even that stopped us from doing
what we should. Throughout these ten years, we added 30,000 new
doctors to our health care network and we have not closed a
single clinic, or a school or a classroom. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Our country has never been subjected to
those so-called economic shock policies that wipe out hospitals,
schools, social security and vital resources for low income
people. We have resisted and not a single one of those measures
was ever used, and those that we did implement to confront this
terribly difficult situation were discussed with all of the
people, not just in our National Assembly. We do have a National
Assembly --even though many people ignore it-- characterized by a
democratic spirit that fills us with pride because it is the
neighbors who put up the candidates, nominate them for delegates
of their districts and elect them by direct and secret ballot. No
candidate is nominated by the party. They are all freely
nominated by the district residents --no more than eight and no
less than two candidates from whom one is chosen-- and elected on
the basis of their own merits and capacity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">These district delegates make up the
municipal assemblies and these municipal assemblies, established
at the grass roots level, nominate the candidates to delegates of
the provincial assemblies and the deputies to the National
Assembly. These delegates must also be elected by direct and
secret ballot and must obtain over 50% of the votes cast.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Almost half of that National Assembly --of
which Alarcón is the Speaker and other comrades in the
delegation whom I can see from up here are members-- is made up
of these district delegates who are, as I have explained,
nominated and elected by the people, with no intervention by our
Party. The only role played by the Party is to guarantee the
observation of the procedures set forth in our Constitution and
our laws for the electoral process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Nobody needs to spend a penny, not a single
one. (APPLAUSE) The district candidates campaign together as a
group, as do the candidates to the National Assembly who are
nominated in every municipality, proportionally to the size of
each municipality, although every one must have a minimum of two
deputies in the National Assembly. This is the procedure, the
method we have developed to guarantee the democratic principle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Yet, as I was telling you, when we adopted
measures to confront the difficult situation of the special
period all were discussed, first of all, at the grass-roots
level, with workers, farmers, students and other mass
organizations, at hundreds of thousands of assemblies and later
at the National Assembly. Then, after they had been studied by
the National Assembly, they were sent back to the grass-roots
level for further discussion before their final adoption by the
Assembly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">These measures protected everyone and
guaranteed social security for all. Among the main measures
adopted were taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and other sumptuary
items. Medicines, food or other essential products were never
taxed and despite everything, we still could ensure a liter of
milk a day for every child up to the age of seven. (APPLAUSE) And
do you know how much the population had to pay for that liter of
milk? According to the official exchange rate, 1.5 cents of a
U.S. dollar, one and a half cents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We still have a ration card and we will
maintain it for a number of foodstuffs. But a pound of rice,
which costs between 12 and 15 cents on the world market,
--without including the cost of transportation from distant
places, since we cannot buy it from the country closest to us,
and without including the cost of internal transport,
distribution and the rest-- is sold to consumers for just under
one and a half cents. (APPLAUSE) And a pound of beans is sold for
the same price as a liter of milk, 1.5 cents of a dollar.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In our country, the vast majority of
citizens pay 0 cents of a dollar for the homes they live in
(APPLAUSE), because today, as a result of the revolutionary laws,
over 85% of homes are owned by the families who live in them
(APPLAUSE), and they do not even pay taxes on them. In the
remaining homes, located in out-of-the-way places deemed
essential for industry or services, the tenants pay an extremely
low rent or are granted usufruct of them. That is why when people
say that someone earns 15 or 20 dollars a month in Cuba, I say
that you have to add X amount for what they would have to pay for
housing if they lived in New York, X number of dollars for the
cost of education, another X number of dollars for health care,
and other rising costs. I am not saying that we are not poor, or
that we do not have needs; but we have distributed our poverty or
resources as fairly as possible. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I will offer two or three more examples. To
watch an important baseball game in Baltimore, for example,
according to our experience costs an average of 19 dollars; at
the current exchange rate, it would cost a Cuban five cents of a
dollar. Going to a movie in New York costs between six and eight
dollars, as you know, but in Cuba it costs five cents of a
dollar. Visiting a museum --for those who pay because children do
not pay-- costs our people five cents of a dollar. This is why we
have been able to withstand such difficult circumstances despite
the crisis, although there are still many things we lack.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The prices of basic medicines are the same
they were in 1959, over 40 years ago. (APPLAUSE) At that time
they were cut by half because one of the first things the
Revolution did was to lower the price of medicines and those who
are administered these medicines in a hospital do not pay a penny
for them. (APPLAUSE) And if they need a heart transplant, a liver
transplant, other transplants or costly operations or treatments,
they do not pay a penny.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This is what the Revolution did for the
people. This is what forged the heroism with which our people
endured the tremendous hardships never before withstood by any
other country throughout more than 40 years of blockade, of which
the last 10 years were characterized by the conditions I have
explained to you. Therefore, it is only natural that the very
United States recognizes that the healthiest young people who
migrate to the United States, one way or another, are the Cubans.
In addition, they have higher qualification than immigrants from
any other country in Latin America or the Caribbean. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I feel it is my duty to explain these
things to you, without straying even an iota from the truth,
since you have so steadfastly shown your solidarity with our
country in the face of so much deception and lies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Now then, our internationalist spirit has
not falter in the slightest during the special period. It is true
that we had to reduce the number of scholarships for foreign
students, whose numbers reached 24,000 in the 1980s. We were the
country with the highest number of foreign students per capita,
among all countries in the world (APPLAUSE), and we did not
charge them a single penny.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There are tens of thousands of
professionals and technical workers in Africa who studied and
graduated in Cuba. I mention Africa, although there were also
students from many other countries, but they primarily came from
the world&#146;s poorest continent. Their numbers decreased
during this past decade.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We also inevitably had to cut back for a
few years on our programs to support health care efforts in other
countries. But I can now say, with great satisfaction, that today
we have more doctors and health care workers providing free
services in the Third World than at any previous time. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I would like to make a few brief comments
on this subject. After Hurricane George --I do not know why they
named it after one of the forefathers of independence in the
United States and its first president-- caused great devastation
and killed many people, we offered Haiti, the poorest country in
our hemisphere, all of the doctors it needed. (APPLAUSE) Then the
same thing happened a few weeks later in Central America with
Hurricane Mitch, which brought sweeping rains associated to
climatic changes. These were particularly destructive because the
forests had been cut down to export timber to the wealthy
countries. We offered the same thing to the Central American
countries as we did to Haiti, and immediately sent hundreds of
doctors and proposed the development of comprehensive health care
programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We felt it was not simply a matter of
sending a number of doctors, helping out for two or three weeks
after the hurricane and then leaving, because this hurricane had
killed over 30,000 people, according to the highest estimates
made at the time. Perhaps the actual number of deaths was around
15,000, since many of those who were missing eventually showed
up. We already knew that over 40,000 children die of preventable
diseases every year in Central America; I will not even mention
the number of adults. This is like an ongoing quiet hurricane,
--much more devastating than Hurricane Mitch-- that kills three
times as many children every single year as the number killed by
Hurricane Mitch, and nobody even talks about it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The countries of Central America accepted
our doctors, primarily those who acted independently; some were
prohibited from accepting. The health care programs that were set
up at that time are in operation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Currently, there are about 450 Cuban
doctors and health care workers, --including a few technicians to
operate the equipment and a few specialized nurses, although
almost all of them are doctors-- in the most isolated locations
of one of these countries where there are snakes, mosquitoes and
no electricity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">These programs are working and expanding.
We do not provide the medicines because we do not have them. The
medicines are supplied by the governments of the countries
involved and some non-governmental organizations. But, our
doctors&#146; services are supplied absolutely free of charge
(APPLAUSE).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Today there are several hundred Cuban
doctors in Haiti --approximately the same number as in the other
country-- who provide medical care to over four million people.
There is also a group of Cuban specialists in the country&#146;s
main hospital and in other hospitals where there were not enough
specialists, and they treat people from any part of the country
who need it. They have saved many lives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Obviously, saving lives is not so difficult
if you follow the simple strategy of immunization with vaccines
that cost a few cents. And of course, the same is true if you
apply the kind of health care policies that permit lives to be
saved and people to be cured at a minimal cost. The lives of
millions of children who die in the Third World could be saved
for just pennies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We offered Central America about 2000
doctors and Haiti as many doctors as it needed. But that was not
all we did. Following cuts to our military spending, we founded a
medical school in Cuba at what used to be a major military
facility, a former defense school There, about 1000 Central
American youth from distant regions and humble backgrounds are
studying medicine. (APPLAUSE) First, they do six months of premed
studies to level them off followed by two years of basic sciences
at that same school. They will then go on to four years of
studies in any of our country&#146;s 20 medical schools which,
combined with the basic sciences schools, can currently
accommodate 40,000 students.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There were years in which 6000 students
entered these medical schools but that number was subsequently
reduced. Now these schools are used to train not only doctors but
also university-graduate nurses and hospital technicians, as well
as dentists. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The new school I have described now has
over 3000 students. In a few months, when the new school year
begins --in some countries high school classes finish in the fall
while in others they finish in the summer-- new students will
enter the premed course. By March, another group of 1700 students
will join bringing the total enrollment to approximately 5000
students. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In three years there will be over 8000
Latin American medical students, who do not have to pay a single
penny for their studies and are even provided with better food
than the 40,000 Cuban university students on scholarships. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At the moment there are also 80 students at
the school from Equatorial Guinea, a Spanish-speaking country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This is a full program called the Latin
American School of Medical Sciences, but it is not limited to the
building where basic sciences and premed courses are taught. The
program includes all the medical schools spread throughout the
country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have not said that in Santiago de Cuba we
have more than 200 Haitian students. They are excellent students.
They have finished their premed and begun their medical studies.
Every year they will be joined by about 80 new students. I have
also not included the young medical students from the Caribbean
who are studying at the medical school in Cienfuegos. At the
moment there must be over 4000 students from Latin America and
the Caribbean studying medicine in Cuba, and that is a
conservative estimate. Soon there will be 10,000. (APPLAUSE) Our
country has done this in spite of the blockade and at absolutely
no cost to the students who are provided with adequate food and
living quarters, laboratory equipment, textbooks and clothing;
and other costs are covered as well, such as transportation to
and from the school.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The invitation was opened to students from
all over Latin America as a way to promote unity, brotherhood,
and cultural exchange.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The school has cultural groups representing
each country. The students will leave with considerable knowledge
about the other countries of the region. Above all, the idea is
to create a new concept, a new concept on the role of doctors in
society because in the capitals and other big cities of Latin
America there are more than enough doctors, but they have not all
been educated about the real duties of a doctor. (APPLAUSE) The
number of students is not as important as the ideas that guide
this program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You cannot imagine how eagerly these
students apply themselves to their studies, how dedicated they
are, even more so than our own students, who are as used to
having these opportunities as to seeing the sun rise every day.
The Latin American students come from very poor regions and
studying medicine was a dream. The results have been excellent.
These schools will turn out excellent doctors! The effort they
put into their studies is more than enough compensation for us. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">What are we doing in Africa? It would be
impossible to bring tens of thousands of Africans to Cuba. You
see, to have one doctor for every 4000 people, Africa would need
about 160,000 doctors. Cuba has one doctor for every 168 people,
and 2000 new doctors graduate every year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In order for sub-Saharan Africa to have one
doctor to 1000 people, there would have to be approximately
596,000 doctors. How are they going to train them? What is the
solution we have implemented through the Comprehensive Health
Care Programs for Africa? We have 3000 doctors available for
sub-Saharan Africa. Their first task is to immediately open a
medical school wherever one is needed. (APPLAUSE) They do this by
inviting high school graduates and offering a six-month upgrading
course. We have just done this in The Gambia, where 158 Cuban
doctors are working. (APPLAUSE) They asked us for 90 more, and we
provided them. This was the first country in Africa where the
comprehensive health care program was initiated. They had 30
Gambian doctors for a population of 1,200,000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The second country was Equatorial Guinea
where over 100 Cuban doctors are already working and have
established a medical school.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We had established a medical school in
Guinea-Bissau many years ago, but it was destroyed in a recent
civil war with foreign intervention. They have not been able to
rebuild it yet, but they asked us if the fifth and sixth year
students could continue their studies in Cuba. They were
immediately admitted (APPLAUSE), but because the rebuilding of
the school has been delayed, they asked us a few weeks ago if we
could take the first, second, third and fourth year students as
well. We told them, &quot;Send them over right away.&quot; Thus,
all these students will be able to continue their studies. This
is how we work. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There is a need to train hundreds of
thousands of African doctors and nobody cares to do anything
about it. There is a very wealthy part of the world that is only
interested in oil, diamonds, minerals, forests, natural gas,
cheap labor, and nothing else. As a result, the situation in that
hemisphere is much worse today than in colonial times, much
worse! The population has grown many times over. The situation is
dreadful.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Yesterday, at the United Nations they were
discussing AIDS. That is a whole other subject. If you will allow
me, I will talk about it later. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Why have I spent so much time on the
subject of medicine? I will explain. We have offered all the
Caribbean countries free university scholarships, for all those
who apply in any field of study. There are many countries in the
Caribbean but the total population is not large. They speak
English. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I recently learned something that really
amazed me. We were visited by some members of the Congressional
Black Caucus --I am talking about this because they mentioned it
to the press but it is the first time I discuss it publicly-- and
as I was telling a lawmaker from Mississippi about these programs
he said: &quot;Listen, there are a lot of places in my district
where there isn&#146;t a single doctor.&quot; I said, &quot;What!
Ah, now I see: you people are the Third World of the United
States.&quot; (APPLAUSE AND SHOUTS) And I said: &quot;We are
prepared to send you a few doctors free of charge, the same as we
do for other countries of the Third World.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I suddenly realized the way things really
are. You always hear about how wealthy the United States is,
about its gross domestic product of over eight trillion dollars,
and so on, and suddenly there I was talking to a respected member
of the U.S. House of Representatives who said that there are not
enough doctors in his district. That is why I said, &quot;We can
send doctors.&quot; And remembering the schools I immediately
added, &quot;And there is something more: listen, we are prepared
to grant a number of scholarships to poor youth in your district
who cannot afford to pay the 200,000 dollars it costs to get a
university degree.&quot; (APPLAUSE AND SHOUTS) When they got back
to the United States they discussed this matter, and they have
told us that they are studying the question of scholarships,
because there are always problems of compatibility among the
professional training systems in different countries. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I assured them that our doctors have
excellent training. They begin to have contact with community
doctors and polyclinics from the very first year, and their six
years of medical school include not only theoretical studies with
excellent professors but also practical experience. They are
constantly in contact with hospitals. Our 20 medical schools
--there are actually 22, but two of them are for basic sciences--
were built near the country&#146;s most important hospitals in
every province. They do their internships and study their
specialties right there, so they do not need to leave the
provinces to study in the country&#146;s capital.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The member of the U.S. House of
Representatives said to me that other minorities face the same
situation and he told to me about the Chicanos, about the Indian
reservations and about other parts of the country, and he meant
not only to Latinos and immigrants but also to people born in the
United States. I said, &quot;Your country is very big, enormous,
and we would not be able to do what we do in other countries. I
do not know how many people there are in your Third World but I
imagine that there must be about 30 or 40 million.&quot;
(APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Do you want to hear something? We have
enough doctors for quite a few million people, but I did not dare
to offer more because we have a lot of commitments, so I said,
&quot;This will not solve your huge problem but I am sure that if
you need doctors and request visas for these doctors to go there,
the authorities could not possibly turn them down. Otherwise, how
could they justify the thousands of doctors they have stolen from
us, the 3000 they took away in the first years of the Revolution
--half of the 6000 doctors we had at the time, a full half!-- and
more than half of our university professors. We were actually
left with only 3000 patriotic doctors (APPLAUSE), and with them
we developed our plans and took on the challenge. Today we have
67,500 doctors (APPLAUSE), over 20 for every doctor they took
from us in the early years. This is the result of tenacity and
the determination to do things&quot;. (APPLAUSE) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">And what is happening now? There is a
policy to promote the defection of our doctors working in
internationalist missions. Something happened a few weeks ago. We
have 108 doctors working in provincial hospitals in Zimbabwe
because they do not have enough doctors, since the apartheid
regime in Rhodesia did not train any black doctors. And so what
was once Rhodesia, and is now the independent nation of Zimbabwe,
after more than 20 years, has many hospitals with no doctors. We
spread our doctors around and sent a team of at least eight or
ten to almost every province: specialists in comprehensive
general medicine, surgeons, orthopedic specialists,
anesthesiologists, X-ray technicians, and other technicians to
repair equipment. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Two of these doctors defected, evidently
taken in by the trillion dollars spent every year on advertising
to exalt consumerism which always leads to the defection of a
small percentage. It is an honor for our country to be able to
say that only 1.6% of all those participating in these
comprehensive health care programs have defected. Still, it
hurts. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">These two headed nowhere else than the
offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Right away, the same characters who fought so hard in Congress to
keep little Elián in the United States addressed the
Administration to obtain visas for these two doctors. Nobody gave
a thought to the children and sick people they had abandoned,
those they were providing medical care for and the lives they
were saving. The important thing was the publicity: &quot;We
snagged two Cuban doctors!&quot; And the same has been done by
the Cuban-American mob, which is the name we give to something
that should never have been called a Foundation since it became a
terrorist organization. (APPLAUSE AND SHOUTS) And now they are
busy trying to do the same in Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, Haiti,
Guyana, Paraguay, and in the 13 countries where these programs
are currently in operation. We plan to extend them to roughly 30
or 40 countries, primarily in Africa. Who knows how many talents
they will manage to steal!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I said to the U.S. Congressman: &quot;How
can they deny you the visas, on what grounds, where is the moral
right if they are doing this kind of things?&quot; (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Could it be that to send these doctors we
will have to resort to using the Cuban Adjustment Act? We call it
a murderous law because of the thousands of lives it claims due
to the privileges that are not granted to people from any other
country in Latin America or the world but only to Cubans, as a
means of promoting destabilization, disorder, and fodder for
anti-Cuban publicity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We would not actually do this, of course.
This is a serious matter. It is my hope that if a group of
lawmakers from the Black Caucus or the Hispanic minority or
representatives of the natives&#146; community requested a number
of doctors, who would not cost the taxpayers or the U.S. Treasury
a penny, I believe that the U.S. government would not deny them a
visa. That is what I think. I cannot see the logic of any other
decision.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">They will argue, as is only logical, about
the training. I am absolutely certain that our doctors could be
subjected to a rigorous examination by any fair tribunal, and
they would successfully pass any tests needed to carry out this
mission honorably.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It is easier to send medical students. They
are already working on that and I can say here that we are
prepared to accept 250 students a year from the United
States&#146; Third World. (APPLAUSE) They will learn Spanish as
well, and they will get to know young people from all over the
hemisphere to whom they will teach all they know about America
and its culture and the others will teach them about theirs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I already said a figure, 250 scholarships
per year, but for the first premed course beginning in March we
could offer 500 to include other minorities. We would not choose
the candidates, they would be selected by the members of Congress
who want to help poor young people in their districts to study
medicine, and these young people would commit themselves to go
back home after they graduate as doctors. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Now I want to add a few things, and to keep
you from becoming impatient I will say something at the end about
the little boy Elián, and then I will conclude. I should see
what time it is. (He looks at his watch) We have already been
here quite some time, and I hope this will not go on much longer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I was saying that the health situation in
Africa is calamitous but the worst is that a new plague is
threatening to exterminate entire nations on that continent, mark
my words. Something else: it is threatening to wipe out the
population of sub-Saharan Africa, that is, 596 million people. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This is a very serious issue that I am only
addressing after much thought. I do not want to sound as an
alarmist but I can tell you without reading from nay papers that
of the 35 million people in the world who are HIV positives, 25
million are African. Based on data I have from various sources
but mostly from my conversations with the head of the UNAIDS
program run by the United Nations, whose raison d&#146;être is
to deal with this problem, I can say that more than two million
Africans are dying every year from AIDS and these include, as you
might imagine, young people, mothers of childbearing age. And for
every two that die, five more become infected. Nineteen million
have already died, there are 12 million orphans, and it is
estimated that in the next ten years this figure will reach 42
million. And there is a long way to go before a vaccine is found.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I wonder, how can a poor Third World
country develop in a situation where 30% of the population is
infected with AIDS and there is a shortage of doctors, medicines
and infrastructure? How can 42 million orphan children be cared
for? It is much distressing that a high percentage of the 19
million who have died are children infected at birth because, of
course, many mothers are infected. How can these children be fed
while there are so many undernourished and hunger prevails in
many of these countries?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There was a meeting in Durban, South
Africa, a few weeks ago and representatives from African
countries and from industrialized nations spoke. They said that
an effort had to be made to deal with this appalling problem. So
I said to myself, they have just discovered AIDS in Africa, or it
seems that they have just discovered it. They discussed what
measures to take, what to do with the companies who manufacture
the medicines so as to reduce their cost, and what little bit of
money could be given to help. They discussed a billion, or a
billion and something. Very well. But, they should know that if
they cut down the price of each treatment that stops or begins to
stop the development of the disease from 10,000 to 1,000 dollars,
they would need 25 billion dollars annually. If the price were
5,000 dollars they would need 125 billion dollars, and at the
current price they would need 250 billion dollars.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Now we will have to see how much they agree
on, how long it will take them to implement a health program, how
many more millions will become infected, how many more millions
will die and how many more millions will add to the number of
orphans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I can assure you that with the cooperation
of the industrial nations a basic problem could be solved, and
that is what I was going to refer to when I spoke about something
that has been raised by several African representatives. They
said: &quot;What is the point? What is the point if we do not
have the infrastructure required to use these medicines?&quot;
They consist of a drugs cocktail to be administered at such and
such a time and under such and such conditions. It is not an
aspirin which one takes for a headache. I have thought a lot
about this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At yesterday&#146;s round table in the UN
many African representatives addressed the AIDS issue, and
recalling what was discussed in Durban I said: &quot;If the
industrial nations put up the money for the medicines, our
country, thanks to the experience acquired through the work of
tens of thousands of doctors in the Third World, could set up
that infrastructure in one year to fight AIDS and other diseases.
(APPLAUSE) And do not worry about politics because our doctors
have strict instructions to follow, one rule above all:
&quot;Never to discuss politics, religion or philosophy&quot;.
And they abide by that rule. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If there is a pastor of a Protestant
church, they work with the pastor. The pastor does not want his
children or his people to die, and he cooperates. He can be a lot
of help in health programs, he can persuade the people to adopt a
given measure. If they are with a pastor from another church, if
he is a Muslim or a spiritual leader of an African religion, the
same thing applies. They do not want the children to die. If it
is a Catholic priest involved, exactly the same, he does not want
the children or the families in the parish to die. Who could
oppose that?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">With the progress of such terrible
epidemic, they will soon be unable to work, even produce food and
the few hospital beds they have will not be enough because AIDS
brings with it other terrible diseases.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To this health predicament we should add
the hundreds of millions of cases of infection or re-infection
with malaria, which kills one million people every year, and the
three million who die from tuberculosis, a disease unquestionably
linked to malnutrition and HIV. I have already said that only 1%
of total world spending on health research programs is used to
research tropical diseases.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The infrastructure could be useful to
provide other medical services not only medication for AIDS. If
there are medicines and vaccines to treat or prevent other
diseases which affect many people, these diseases could be fought
as well, services could be provided, and these are indeed fairly
economical. We could send a minimum of 100 doctors to each of the
countries in most need in sub-Saharan Africa.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Those doctors would organize the
infrastructure, direct and train the young people. If they were
assigned young 15-year-old assistants with a sixth-grade
education, with the right books they could turn them into nurses
in half the time needed in a nursing school. If they want to
train orthopedic specialists, surgeons, or specialists in other
fields of medicine, they could train them in half the time used
in a residency in a hospital. So, those doctors could do much
more than create the infrastructure: they could train tens of
thousands of qualified personnel. In addition, they could open
university schools of medicine in countries where they do not
exist. Cuba would not charge a single penny for those services,
nor wait years to implement them. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">They will say that there is no money. A
little bit could be taken from the amount spent on advertising,
which encourages consumption not only in developed societies but
also among billions of people living in underdeveloped countries
where they can have hardly any consumption. They could also take
a small amount from military spending, which currently totals 800
billion dollars. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">They could release a worldwide issue of
bonds and many good people who do not know about this could buy
bonds as part of their contribution. One more thing: a small tax
on speculative operations, and there would be more than enough
money not just for that but practically enough to develop the
whole Third World. It is necessary, it is absolutely crucial.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Why is it not done? Why do they talk so
much about human rights when all these catastrophic things are
happening in the world? Who is responsible for the death of tens
of millions of people every year whose lives could be saved?
There are children among that number --eleven million of those
who die-- teenagers, young people and adults, who also die for
lack of treatment or of some disease that was not treated timely
or because of some malformation that could be mended, or because
they needed surgery or an orthopedic operation after an accident.
It is not known how many die who could be saved, or how many old
people could live a little longer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A person who lives 50 years --you know a
lot of them and have many relatives like that-- would like to
live 10 more years, 20 or 30 more years. And 70-year-olds would
like to live five, eight or 10 more years, or people my age, 74,
as you remembered today, would like to live four or five or even
10 more years to see how the world evolves and if any predictions
come true.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Personally, I would like to have more time
to benefit from the experience I have accumulated in the long
time I have spent fighting in the service of the people.
(APPLAUSE) My adversaries talk about &quot;Castro in power for X
number of years&quot;, &quot;Castro&#146;s dictatorship&quot;,
&quot;Castro&#146;s tyranny&quot;, &quot;Castro who is in power
and does not want to step down&quot;, and a number of other
things. If power is not used to do something good, it is
absolutely worthless, and it would be crazy to want it.
(APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Anyway --as I have explained to many
visitors-- I have very few constitutional and legal powers, the
minimum. I do not appoint ambassadors. In every part of the world
the President of the country appoints ambassadors, appoints
ministers. I do not appoint ministers, I do not appoint anyone to
any state office. The ambassadors whose names are put forward are
suggested by a commission which analyzes all candidates and
submits their names to the 31 members Council of State, which
must approve them and at the end, my job is to sign.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The same is true with pardons, or
commutation of a death sentence, in the case of the highest
penalty; these are discussed by the 31 members of the Council of
State.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">But, such power is not important to me, I
do not need that. I think that a person who governs or a leader
does not need the trappings of power, what he or she needs is
moral authority, is moral power. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Only once in the course of 41 years were
there some public disturbances in Havana, near the harbor. They
were associated to announcements made by foreign radio stations
in the sense that a number of boats would come from the United
States close to Cuba to pick up immigrants. They knew that we did
not shoot at or try to intercept boats in the sea with people on
board. When speedboats from the United States began to come on
smuggling operations, one of them came very close to the
coastline east of Havana, and those keeping watch, taken by
surprise by that unusual occurrence, told them to halt and shot
at them; some people wounded, I do not know if anyone died.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Another time a tractor --it was pulling a
cart with people in it towards the coast-- attempted to run over
a police officer who stood in front of it and its partner who was
with him fired shots. Some people were wounded and some died.
That happened twice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">On another occasion a sand dredging boat
was hijacked with crew members aboard --all this is encouraged by
the Cuban Adjustment Act-- and a patrol boat fired some shots;
luckily no one was hit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Then, all coast guard forces and
authorities were instructed: &quot;Do not shoot at nor try to
intercept any vessel with people on board who are trying to
leave, even if it is in the middle of the harbor.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Even the Regla passenger ferry, which as
many of you might know provides sea transportation between Old
Havana and that other municipality, was the target of a
hijacking. Someone went on board with a revolver who had several
accomplices already there; they overpowered the skipper and left
through the same port. Nobody laid a finder on them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The famous incident they talk about
involving the tugboat <i>13 de Marzo</i> has its own history,
which we know fully and in detail because we ordered an
exhaustive investigation into it. There is a place where the
tugboats that work the port are kept, that was assailed and those
keeping watches were neutralized, communications destroyed and a
tug stolen. Three people who worked there boarded another tugboat
and another three or four --I do not have the exact numbers right
now-- boarded a third one. This was at night and without saying
anything to anyone they left with the two tugboats to try and
intercept those who were escaping. No one knew anything; in fact,
hours had gone by since the theft of the tug.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As soon as the relevant authorities learned
of the event they issued immediate orders to the coast guards to
sail towards the course the others had set to prevent an accident
and to order the return of the tugboats, which had followed to
try and intercept the first tug.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It was in the early hours of morning, there
was a rough sea and big waves. Before a coast guard cutter
reached the tug --it luckily saved almost half of those who were
on the stolen vessel, since the coast guard had life vests, ropes
and other equipment to aid and rescue shipwrecks-- one of the two
tugs which were trying to intercept the first one crashed into
the stern of the stolen tug, which then sunk. The few crewmembers
on the other two tugs rescued several of the shipwrecked people
despite the fact that they lacked the right equipment and were
afraid of being kidnapped themselves. The coast guard boat soon
arrived and even in those difficult conditions and the darkness
of the night, they saved 25 people. That is the true story. Ah,
but they had to invent lies and create a patently false myth
around the incident.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I assure you that I am not exaggerating,
not altering the facts one iota. I would feel infinitely ashamed
to try to justify any disgraceful act. That is not our way.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There must be many of those 1200 prisoners
we took at the Bay of Pigs still in the United States. Not one of
them can say that they were hit with a rifle butt, despite the
fact that over 100 comrades had died and hundreds had been
wounded. I was there, this is not something I was told, I was
personally involved in taking prisoners. I even walked in front
of an armed squadron of the invaders that was positioned behind
one of the mangrove swamps --I was going along a road close to
the shore-- they saw me, just a few meters away but did not fire.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There are moments in a battle when the
enemy&#146;s morale completely deflates and no one fires any more
shots. Later, during the trial, they claimed this as a merit,
that is, to say in their favor that I walked in front of them who
were armed with automatic weapons and they did not shoot on me.
Well, thanks a lot! I really thank them for that. I would not
have reached this age of 74, so I thank them. (APPLAUSE) But no
one can say that they were mistreated and they had invaded our
country, armed and sent by a foreign power.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If it had happened the other way around,
you know that at the very least they would have been sentenced to
life imprisonment. And over here it is not very easy for someone
with a life sentence to be released because those Puerto Ricans
who have been in prison for many years and were recently released
(APPLAUSE) had a lot to suffer before seeing the fruit of a long
solidarity struggle. I do not know the exact number of years that
they were in prison, perhaps some of you can tell me. (They tell
him it was 20 years.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Brothers and sisters, I can assure you that
in Cuba some of the mercenaries who receive pay from abroad to
carry out subversive activities spend barely three months in jail
before the pressure and letters from all sides start arriving,
according to plans and mechanisms set in place beforehand, asking
us to set them free. We have released a large number of
rightfully sentenced counterrevolutionaries! Because it has been
a long struggle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At the beginning of the Revolution there
were 300 counterrevolutionary organizations involved in
terrorism, and when 1200 prisoners were captured in just that one
action, they did not even spend two years in prison. We suggested
to those who sent them: &quot;Look, if you pay damages in
medicine and baby-food, we will set them all free.&quot; Quite a
few of them committed crimes afterwards, they killed our comrades
with bombs and attacks. If they had been in prison for 30 years,
the lives of many comrades would have been spared. But, that risk
did not enter into our calculations, and one day a ship loaded
with &quot;heroes&quot; reached the United States with no
problems. They were given a flag, I think that the then president
gave it to them or the other way around so that one day it might
be unfurled in a free Cuba. In fact they could not save anything,
neither the flag nor the pennant, nor their weapons, not a thing.
That was many years ago.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Since those incidents I have spoken to
quite a few of those who took part in that expedition who have
changed their opinions, their way of thinking, who feel different
now because people can change.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I gave you the example of what happened in
the Bay of Pigs because it shows the continuity of a policy that
we have pursued since the war in the Sierra Maestra. In the first
clashes, the enemy soldiers fought on to the last cartridge, they
thought we would kill them. Later, that changed. Over the course
of the war we took thousands of prisoners. We gave priority to
their wounded and treated them before our own. No prisoner was
ever executed, not a single one of them was ever beaten. The
International Red Cross can witness to that. They have the lists
and the files of hundreds of prisoners taken captive in the last
offensive by government forces against our Front Number One in
the summer of 1958. You can look into through them to see if any
soldier was ever beaten, if any soldier was executed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">They were our arms suppliers. They were
transferred to other provinces and when the columns arrived and
they found themselves losing in some battle they did not fight on
to the end anymore, like at the beginning. To be more exact, it
has to be said that, as a rule, they always fought, they did not
cease offering strong resistance but when they realized the
battle was lost, they surrendered. There were soldiers who
surrendered three times. Why? Because we had a policy towards the
enemy, just as we had a policy towards the civilian population.
They killed civilian population, burned houses, stole everything,
and paid nothing. We paid for everything we bought. If there was
nobody around, we left the money with a neighbor or somewhere
else. For the whole time the war lasted, in Front Number One in
the Sierra Maestra, which was where all the columns left from, we
had the same war doctrine, the same political doctrine. I do not
remember a single case of one of our combatants behaving
disrespectfully towards the wife or daughter of a peasant family.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">After we were scattered --immediately after
the landing our yacht-- the war was won in less than 24 months,
starting out with seven armed men, with the help of all the
people against forces which had 80,000 men, that is, counting
soldiers, sailors and police. Why? Firstly, because we were
defending a just cause (APPLAUSE), and secondly because we had a
policy towards the peasantry and the population in general, and a
policy towards the enemy. Without that policy, victory would not
have been possible, not in 2 year nor in 30, even assuming that
everything else was done more or less correctly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Those traditions remain in place still
today. You can ask South Africans who were prisoners of our
troops if anyone beat them, if a single one of them was executed,
because we taught and passed on our war policy to those with whom
we collaborated. There are many places where combatants kill one
another. That is how it is.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In our case, neither in our war nor on our
internationalist missions was any prisoner ever beaten or
executed. There are living witnesses to this. That, of course, is
what builds a good morale and authority.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Even the police were surprised when those
disturbances occurred in the capital on August 5 of 1994. It had
never happened before. Groups of civilians who numbered several
hundred people began throwing stones at shop windows and houses.
People were somewhat dismayed. I heard the news, I was on my way
to my offices and they told me, &quot;This is happening.&quot; I
said, &quot;Not one single unit is to move out.&quot; I alerted
my escort, nine men who were with me. I had requested three jeeps
--I wanted to go in a jeep, not in a safe car, nor in an armored
car-- and the jeeps arrived. Counting the nine in my escort, a
comrade who is here and at that time was working with me and whom
you know, Felipe Pérez Roque, presently our brilliant minister
of Foreign Affairs (APPLAUSE) and comrade Lage, who joined us on
the way, we were a total of 12 people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We headed towards the place where all the
commotion was. The escort had categorical orders not to use
weapons. When we arrived I stepped down the jeep, walked to the
place and the people reacted immediately. In a matter of minutes
the disturbances ceased and even those same people who had been
thrown stones got caught up in the mood and marched in one great
throng. We went down to the Malecón and back on foot. That is
and will always be the Revolution&#146;s style. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In our country, the people have not seen a
fire truck turning its hoses on the population, or men wearing
those outfits which make them look like denizens of another
planet, carrying all that gear and using brutal methods. That has
never happened in our country in 40 years. We would give a big
prize to anyone who could show us just one photograph of that.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I remember that in the first years of the
Revolution there were 300 counterrevolutionary organizations,
armed bands, all over the country, thousands of people in prison.
When I was visiting the Isle of Pines, now the Isle of Youth, I
used to meet with those prisoners who were working in the fields
with machetes, axes and I talked to them. They never tried to
harm me!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I met several times with those who invaded
through the Bay of Pigs, I even went to the prison after they
were sentenced. Not one of them showed me the least disrespect!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Ethics and an honorable behavior are
invaluable. That is the most powerful force anyone can have.
(APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have already told you about my trips,
about all the threats. I even said I would like to live a few
years more. Nevertheless, I can also assure you that I would not
change a single principle, I would not accept a single dishonor,
I would not give in to a single threat in exchange for my life.
(APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">That is why I told you I was happy when I
began the trip to this country, to New York rather --I do not
have a visa to visit the country, only for New York and within
its 25 miles, not a millimeter beyond. I was pleased of my
contempt for the series of threats and my desire to meet with
you.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Perhaps these views I have offered you will
be useful for others who, like you, have been so brave and have
shown us so much solidarity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have spoken of the Third World&#146;s
serious social problems. But there are serious social problems
even in such a rich country as this, the richest in the world. I
want to mention some of them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Thirty-six million people, 14% of the
population, live below the poverty line, a rate twice as high as
that of other developed countries. Double that of Europe and
Japan.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Forty-three million people are not
health-insured and another 30 million have such low medical
coverage that it is practically non-existent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There are 30 million illiterates and
another 30 million functional illiterates. Cuba did not make this
up, these are official figures from international organizations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Among the black population the rate of
poverty is over 29%; the rate for the whole population is 14%.
The poverty rate among the black population is, therefore, more
than twice that of the general population of the United States.
Among black children the figure reaches 40%. In some cities and
rural areas in the United States it is over 50%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Despite economic expansion, the poverty
rates in America are from two to three times higher than those in
Western Europe, and 22% of American children live in poverty.
These are official figures.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Only 45% of all workers in the private
sector have social security coverage. It is estimated that 13% of
the total U.S. population will not live beyond 60 years of age.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Women still earn only 73% of what men earn
in comparable jobs and make up 70% of part-time workers, those
who have no right to any social benefits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Between 1981 and 1995, 85% of new workers
with more than one job were women.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The richest 1% of the population, who in
1975 owned 20% of the wealth, now owns 36%. And the gap keeps
widening.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There is not one millionaire, not one
person who belongs to the upper middle class, among the 3600
people sentenced to capital punishment who are now on death row
in U.S. prisons. One might wonder why. You perhaps have a better
answer than I do. I am not accusing anyone, I simply say what is
going on.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Apparently, one needs to reach the category
of millionaire to have the decency and discipline needed to never
be targeted for such sentence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There are more statistics which are a
little hard to take, but which I have to tell you about.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In the whole history of the United States
not one single white man has ever been executed for having raped
a black woman. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Nevertheless, and this is an historical
fact, during the time that rape was considered a capital crime,
of the 455 people executed for rape, 405 were black: that is to
say, 9 out of 10.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In the state of Pennsylvania, for example,
where the Declaration of Independence was proclaimed in 1776,
only 9% of the total population are black. Yet, 62% of those
sentenced to death, that is, a proportion seven times greater,
are black.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">One more thing. More than 90% of the 3600
sentenced to death were victims of physical or sexual abuse
during their childhood.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A recent study by a non-governmental
organization indicates that black men have a 13 times greater
chance of being given longer sentences than white men when it
comes to drug-related offenses, although there are five times as
many white men dealing drugs in the United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">More than 60% of the women in prison in the
United States are African-American or Hispanic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Perhaps all we Hispanics,
African-Americans, and all people from different ethnic groups
other than white are particularly prone to commit all sorts of
crimes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I am not glossing over the crimes that may
have been committed, far from it. Neither am I in a position to
accurately know what the procedures are like and what usually
happens. I simply wonder why. I simply wonder if we are
genetically criminal, in which case it would not matter if all of
sub-Saharan Africa, if all the indigenous peoples, if all the
mixed race people and all the white people in Latin America, all
the people in Caribbean nations including Cubans, of course, were
vanished. This is a question that we have at least the right to
ask ourselves. I have lived these 74 years that you remembered in
which I have dealt with a lot of people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I was born in the country, the son of a
landowner. My father was a poor peasant from Spain. He first came
to Cuba as a draftee with the Spanish army in the last war of
independence and had never gone to school. Once the conflict was
over in 1898, he was sent back to his country. But, later he came
back, <i>motu proprio</i>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">He worked in the system in place at that
time and eventually managed to bring together and direct more
than a hundred immigrants or Cuban day laborers like himself. It
was the time when the United Fruit Company, in order to develop
its sugar plantations in the neocolonial system installed in
Cuba, cut and burned the precious wood forests, like those that
were used to build the famous Escorial palace in Spain and even
the biggest battleship in the days of Admiral Nelson. It was sunk
at the Battle of Trafalgar. Those woods were highly prized and my
father and those men he had recruited were cutting the forests
and precious wood. Who could blame them?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Well, he made some money and bit by bit he
bought up land, a lot of land. He ended up owning about 900
hectares of land and controlling more than 10,000 hectares of
leased land. I was born and lived on that huge estate. I was
lucky to be the son and not the grandson of a landowner,
therefore, I had no time to develop the mentality and culture of
the rich. There is no merit in being a revolutionary, it depends
on many factors. All my friends were poor children and teenagers
of my own age. I got to know the poor shacks all around, both on
my family land and on the enormous plantations owned by the large
U.S. companies where many Haitian immigrants lived. There the
living and working conditions were worse than those of slaves
although slavery had been abolished in Cuba in 1886. That did not
make me a revolutionary, but it helped me later on to understand
the situation and the injustices in the country where I was born.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I will add a few words to what I have said
so far. You mentioned a while ago the name of an African-American
recently executed. You know that our people vigorously condemned
the judicial murder of Shaka Sankofa for a crime he did not
commit (APPLAUSE), despite the unanimous condemnation of world
public opinion and even that of many governments in the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I requested a lot of information, data, and
details. I even went as far as to look at small maps and sketches
of the place where the crimes he was accused of was committed.
Only person claimed to have seen him, at night, from quite a
distance, a quick glance that not even the most sensitive camera
could have recorded, that, and other evidence, led me to believe
in his innocence. I am not saying this because someone claimed it
was true, but because I analyzed all the information and reached
that conclusion. (APPLAUSE) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I even analyzed his social origins, the
marginality into which he was born, his first clashes with the
law. When explaining to our own people, I have quoted them as an
example of the true factors which lead a young man, black or
white or of whatever ethnic group, to commit a crime. Also, I am
a lawyer. I know something about law. I defended myself when I
was on trial for the attack on the Moncada garrison and I have
had to do so more than once since I became a lawyer. I hardly had
any other clients. (LAUGHTER)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If these were not my own conclusions, I
would be acting like a common demagogue in stating what I have
just said. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A televised round table was held in our
country in which internationally known figures participated. I
can see from here one person who took part in that round table.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I am equally well aware that for some time
now you have been caught up in a very just struggle, a struggle
which our people also fully support: the struggle for the release
of Mumia Abu-Jamal (SHOUTS AND PROLONGED APPLAUSE), a journalist
sentenced to death whose unfair trial has given rise to a giant
protest movement throughout the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If we go a bit further and analyze the
historical data, regarding that one white man for every nine
African-Americans executed for rape --there were about 50 whites
in total-- we see that other factors aside, the element of social
marginality was always present. And when, as it is the case with
the African-Americans, racial discrimination is added to social
marginality, tens and tens of millions of people suffer horribly
from this injustice, including those who have never been
sentenced to death nor to prison. Actually, they were born
sentenced to be humiliated every day of their lives. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I am more or less white. I say more or less
because there is no ethnic group that can claim purity. I
remember that I visited the United States in November 1948. I
remember because I was there at the same time that Truman,
despite all predictions, won the elections. I had gone to visit
Harvard. I wanted to study economics. I already had revolutionary
ideas but I wanted to equip myself with more knowledge. On the
journey back to New York, I traveled in a cheap second-hand car
bought for 200 or 300 dollars, one of those sold for a bit more
than they are worth as scrap metal, and I drove along those
highways down to Florida to go on to Cuba by sea in a ferry. I
stopped several times in some places for lunch, a meal or to buy
something. I perceived contempt more than once, sort of a
disparaging attitude just because I spoke another language or
because I was Hispanic. I had the impression that it was not only
certain ethnic groups that were discriminated against but also
people of any other nationality who spoke a different language.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Since then I have only been back to the
United States for a few days in, I think, 1956. I was living in
Mexico, preparing to go back to Cuba. I visited New York and
other places to meet with the few Cuban immigrants there were in
the United States at that time when the Cuban Adjustment Act did
not exist. No one could just arrive on a boat or raft; there were
almost no aliens here back then. It was actually the Revolution,
which opened the doors to hundreds of thousands of people who had
wanted to emigrate for a long time, and had no hope of doing so.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Therefore, we could remind those who so
hate Cuba, the Revolution and myself in particular that they
should thank the Revolution every now and then, because without
the Revolution there would not be many Cuban millionaires
(APPLAUSE), without the Revolution there would not be a so-called
Cuban-American National Foundation (BOOING), without the
Revolution there would not be Cuban members of the U.S. Congress,
they would not be able to sponsor certain bills, they would not
be courted in the election campaigns, they would not be granted
their every wish even though a large majority of them do not vote
because given the privileges granted to them it suits them better
to be Cuban than American citizens.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">What I say can be irrefutably proved. There
are statistics, I asked for them one day. For example, how many
resident&#146;s visas were granted in the last 30 years before
the triumph of the Revolution? The numbers were insignificant in
the 30s and 40s, and scarcely 2,000 or 3,000 between 1950 and
1959.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It was actually the Revolution, which
opened the doors to hundreds of thousands of people who had
wanted to emigrate for a long time, and had no hope of doing so.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It is well known that in the first few days
of January 1959 a large number of war criminals, embezzlers and
Batista accomplices who had murdered thousands of Cubans and
looted the country found save haven in the United States. The
first revolutionary laws that had to do with recovering embezzled
goods, with lowering the rates for basic services, with giving
back employment to workers unjustly dismissed during the tyranny,
with urban and agrarian reforms and other measures of elementary
social justice terrified the richest sectors of our society and
they began to emigrate to the United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">From the first day of the Revolution, visas
for the United States were unusually easy to obtain, especially
by those from the upper and middle classes, for doctors and other
university educated professionals, professors and teachers,
technicians and skilled workers. Many of these people had always
longed to immigrate to this country. Hostility towards the
Revolution and the aim of depriving us of a skilled labor force
became obvious almost immediately. They also needed former
Batista officers and young people to feed the mercenary attack
brigade, a plan that nobody knew about at that time. However,
permission was always given to those leaving legally for the
United States. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The brain drain encouraged the enormous
efforts in the field of education that the triumphant Revolution
had begun immediately. Even during the fighting at the Bay of
Pigs the commercial air flights were not interrupted. After the
Missile Crisis they abruptly suspended the flights and the visas.
Tens of thousands of families were separated. On the other hand,
even before the Cuban Adjustment Act, they allowed to enter U.S.
territory anyone who reached their shores by any means available
to them even by hijacking planes or boats.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">After the Camarioca incident, 360,000
Cubans left the country legally, in absolutely safety and without
a single victim. Among these there were, in addition to relatives
of United States residents, a large number of professionals and
teachers who could earn a salary ten times higher in the United
States than in Cuba, and skilled workers and technicians from
major industries. They were in fact economic migrants.
Nevertheless, everyone who went to the United States was given
the name of &quot;political refugee&quot; or &quot;exile&quot;.
If this concept were applied to Mexicans and other Latin
Americans who migrate to the United States, there would be
between 12 and 15 million Mexican political refugees (APPLAUSE),
a million Haitian political refugees, a million Dominican
political refugees, hundreds of thousands of Central Americans
political refugees, and who knows how many Puerto Ricans.
(APPLAUSE) Because Puerto Ricans are patriots and love their
country. So why do they come to the United States? For economic
reasons and there are almost as many here as on their island.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There is a million in New York. This year
we saw them supporting the just cause of Vieques. (APPLAUSE) We
had a televised round table on that with many international
personalities of great prestige.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">These round tables are broadcast on
television via satellite in English, of course, which is the
language most spoken throughout the world. Our television also
seeds internet. Unfortunately only 1% of Africans have access to
the Internet, so we have to reach them by radio. The same thing
happens with Latin America.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As to this subject of communications and
cooperation with Third World countries, I want to inform you that
we have developed a program to teach reading and writing by
radio. This idea came up one day when I asked the president of
Niger, who was visiting Cuba, what the illiteracy rate was in his
country, and he said, 87% illiteracy and only 17% have any
schooling. We are celebrating the arrival of the next century and
the next millenium and I wonder: In what century of the third
millenium will that country with the same population as Cuba have
eradicated illiteracy?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I was contemplating the fact that our
country with 11 million people, the same as Niger, has 250,000
professors and teachers. It is the same as with doctors: Cuba has
the highest per capita rate of teachers in the world. When one
thinks about that illiteracy rate knowing that infant mortality
among children from under 5 years of age in Niger is higher than
200 for every 1000 live births, that is, more than 25 times as
high as the infant mortality rate in Cuba, it is impossible not
to ask oneself: When? When? When? I asked him, &quot;Do they have
radios?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes, almost every family has a
radio.&quot; I said, &quot;How come if they do not have
electricity?&quot; He explained, &quot;Yes, because they have a
Japanese device which costs X number of dollars to recharge the
radio batteries.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I suggested to a group of Cuban educational
experts that they study the possibility of teaching reading and
writing by radio, starting with the idea of developing a small
manual which, using pictures of animals, plants and common
objects would identify the letters of the alphabet and would make
it possible to make syllables, words, phrases, and to introduce
concepts in the given language, using radio broadcasts under the
guidance of specialized teachers. In three months our educational
experts designed a method which when tested in the Creole
language in Haiti with 300 illiterate people showed really
promising results. A pilot program will soon begin with 3000
people. A literacy course using television would be very simple,
but access to television is difficult for the majority of the
world&#146;s illiterate. Our educational specialists who created,
monitored and guided the experiment are astounded. The course is
ready in French, Portuguese and Creole.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Here is another way of cooperating with the
Third World, by teaching hundreds of millions of people to read
and write for an infinitesimal cost. Enough talk about the 800
million illiterate adults, if by using radio, which is not the
Internet nor television, it is possible to teach reading and
writing to hundreds of millions of people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It is hard to imagine how humiliated a
person feels who cannot read and write. It reminds me a lot of my
mother and my father, who barely knew how to read and write, and
I can bear witness to how much they suffered. I know they did.
That explains the hunger for knowledge that exists in our
country. Even when our people have completed grade 10, or grade
12, they still have an insatiable hunger to learn about other
things. We have found this out and have created certain programs
--I hope that someday you will learn about them-- which are
simply astounding, hoping to create a comprehensive and general
mass culture. We are even going to teach languages.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I will give you a preview. The new school
year has already begun in Cuba. After the battle to get Elián
back and our amazement at how talented our children were, our
schools now have a 20-inch color television for every 100 of our
2,400,000 elementary, junior and senior high school students, at
a cost of 4.6 million dollars (APPLAUSE); and 15, 000 video
cassette players at a cost of 1.5 million dollars. So, we are
already making full use of the mass media in our school system in
support of our more than 250,000 teachers and professors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Let me just say that in October a course on
narrative techniques designed by one of our country&#146;s most
capable intellectuals will be broadcast from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00
a.m. And starting on November 1, from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.
there will be a language course, three times a week. To put it
simply, many people in our population can not remember the
grammar they learned a long time ago. I joke that we do not speak
Spanish, but a sort of dialect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">So, three times a week in Spanish and
--just imagine-- twice a week in English! We consider English to
be a universal language. Centuries of British colonialism and
about 100 years of --lets give it an elegant name-- enormous
American influence has made it into a universal language. It is
widely used, but not patented, so we shall use it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Almost all scientific and literary books
are published first in English. I have been given many as
presents and they are in English.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We are going to make sure the knowledge of
English is widespread; television courses are already being
prepared. Many of those thousands of teachers will see them and
record them and show them in school, they will not have to go
anywhere for them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Immediately after we are going to begin
French courses. Our hope is that all of our people or the
overwhelming majority who are interested will know three
languages: Spanish, English and French (APPLAUSE) at minimal
cost. That is, the cost of the electricity for the broadcasts and
the printed materials that will be sent to all those who would
take the course directly, or to those who request them. In the
latter case we will send them the materials charging them for the
costs of production and distribution. These are courses for
everybody who wants to take advantage of them and we will promote
them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I think that the fact that I have told you
about this idea will be a source of satisfaction for many of my
compatriots, for almost all of them. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">One day I asked the minister [of
Education], &quot;How many English teachers do you need for high
school?&quot; And he said, &quot;Two thousand&quot;. I replied,
&quot;That is more than enough.&quot; We are not planning to
reduce the number of graduates in primary or high school
education. On the contrary, we will not reduce the number of
teachers even by one; the numbers will be increased so as to be
able to reduce the number of pupils per teacher. That battle has
already begun to improve the quality of our education. But we
will place the mass media, our television services with no
commercials, at the service of education and of a general,
comprehensive level of culture. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I think that our country is on its way to a
completely new era. I will say no more. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have gone over my time. I have not kept
my word. (APPLAUSE) I will only take up a few more minutes of
your time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I promised you that before I finished my
speech I would talk to you about two things: first, the little
boy. Elián is doing wonderfully. (APPLAUSE) You can hardly
imagine what a happy boy he is, how intelligent he is, what a
serious boy he is, he is really extraordinary. Vast crowds did
not welcome him --just as we said-- but only by some schoolmates
and his closest relatives. Not one of us, not a single Party or
State official was there. The family spent six minutes greeting
those who were there to welcome them and then immediately left
the airport with Elián. He did not miss classes, not even the
day he left the United States. In two months, with his family,
his teacher and his little classmates, he had made extraordinary
progress and later, in Cuba, from June 29 up until July 28, he
had intensive classes together with his classmates who were here;
he was missing some sounds. He graduated on a par with all the
other children and moved up to second grade.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">His father insisted that I meet him. I said
to him, &quot;I will wait until he has finished school.&quot; And
when he finished the school year, very discreetly, I went to see
him and said hello.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Now we should make sure that this child has
a normal life, normal classes, because everybody knows this
little boy. We can count on the support of the whole population,
the cooperation of all our people not to approach him when he
goes to school, not to shout slogans at him, to treat him like
any other child. He has only appeared on television a few times,
and that is because the people were demanding it. He has never
been asked a direct question, he is always shown with his family
and only for a few minutes. He has been given careful attention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The first day of his new school year has
already begun. He is living in the same modest house where he
lived before. He is studying in the same school, he has the same
teachers --because these rotate up to the fourth grade-- the
teacher who was in Wye Plantation and the other teacher whom they
did not allow to go, and his same classmates from first grade are
still with him and will be until the fourth grade. Also, in the
middle of this month his father began working in the same modest
work place because that is what he wanted. Everybody wants him to
visit. Because not only the little boy but his father also became
very respected in our country. He resisted all pressures, even
when they tried to buy him out with his son, with promises to
return him the child if he stayed to live in the United States.
Millions of dollars, and he never wavered, not for one second.
(APPLAUSE) It seems to me that he is an example. On this point I
should say that I will not elaborate on the details, we can send
printed material, that way I will save time. But you will hear
more about the child.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We strongly believe in the idea that this
little boy should be given the best possible education.
Everything would be meaningless if this boy came home and were
not really a good student and a good person. They are a good
example for our people, and to a certain degree, a good example
for many millions of people around the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Our people will always thank those of you
who were so worried and those lawmakers who spoke here and others
who fought so hard as well as the Council of Churches and the
various other churches who honorably defended such a just cause.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In the same token I should say that our
people will never forget and will always thank the American
people who spoke out en masse in favor of the legitimate rights
of a father and his son. (APPLAUSE) Once more I said to myself:
the American people are very idealistic, therefore, for them to
support an unjust cause they first have to be deceived, they have
to be made to believe, like in Vietnam and other places, that
that was right. In this case, they learned the truth due to a
variety of factors, particularly through the mass media which
broadcast footage of 400,000 mothers marching, hundreds of
thousands of children marching, a million people marching in a
struggle that extended for seven months and which still continues
against the Cuban Adjustment Act, for the victims it creates.
That struggle is also being waged against the Torricelli Act, the
Helms-Burton Act, the blockade and the economic war, in fact for
respect and peace for our country. This is what we swore to do
there, in Baraguá, the site of Antonio Maceo&#146;s historic
protestation, and we are still struggling for those aims today.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When the U.S. public learned the truth,
they supported the child and his family in numbers that rose to
over 80% and which among African-Americans at the height of the
events reached 92%. (APPLAUSE) Our people will never forget that.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I am not claiming that our country is a
perfect model of equality and justice. We believed at the
beginning that when we established the fullest equality before
the law and complete intolerance for any demonstration of sexual
discrimination in the case of women, or racial discrimination in
the case of ethnic minorities, these phenomena would vanish from
our society. It was some time before we discovered that
marginality and racial discrimination with it are not something
that one gets rid of with a law or even with ten laws, and we
have not managed to eliminate them completely, even in 40 years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There has never been nor will there ever be
a case where the law is applied according to ethnic criteria.
However, we did discover that the descendents of those slaves who
had lived in the slave quarters were the poorest and continued to
live, after the supposed abolition of slavery, in the poorest
housing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There are marginal neighborhoods; there are
hundreds of thousand of people who live in marginal
neighborhoods, and not only blacks and mixed race people, but
whites as well. There are marginal whites, too, and all this we
inherited from the previous social system. I told you that our
country is on its way to a new era. I hope someday to be able to
speak to you of the things we are doing today and how we are
going to continue to do them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We do not have the money to build housing
for all the people who live in what we could call marginal
conditions. But we have lots of other ideas which will not wait
until the end of times and which our united and justice loving
people will implement to get rid of even the tiniest vestiges of
marginality and discrimination. I have faith that we will succeed
because that is the endeavor today of the leaders of our youth,
our students and our people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I shall not say more, I am simply saying
that we are aware that there is still marginality in our country.
But, there is the will to eradicate it with the proper methods
for this task to bring more unity and equality to our society.
(APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">On behalf of my Homeland, I promise to keep
you informed about the progress of our efforts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When those American friends went to Cuba
and talked to us of the two cases I mentioned, Sankofa and Mumia,
they supplied me with detailed information about their lives and
the injustices committed against them. The televised round tables
helped a lot to spread awareness about the seriousness of what
was happening. It is not a disgrace to be poor, the errors that
any person might commit as a child or a teenager are not a
disgrace. What is a disgrace is that in the century which is just
beginning, with all the technological advances that have been
made, when humankind even has aspirations to populate the planet
Mars, there are children, teenagers and adults on our planet
living in conditions of marginality (APPLAUSE), and that in many
countries on top of being marginalized they are discriminated
against. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This is the last thing I will talk about.
There is only this page left to explain to you about a news item
that came out today. The pastor of this church spoke about it,
and referred to a sign. It seems incredible to me that the
simplest thing in the world has made big news. I thought big news
had to be something that was happening in the world, the subjects
that were being discussed at the UN Summit Meeting, what we had
to do to save humankind and not only Africa. At the rate we are
going, not only Africans will vanish but all of us as well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At this rate, with these models of
consumerism which lead to the destruction of the natural means of
life, of the atmosphere, to shortages and pollution of drinking
water and of the seas, to climatic changes, natural disasters, to
poverty, to deeper and widening gaps within countries and between
countries, you can state with mathematical precision that the
social and economic order which exists in the world today is
unsustainable. I feel that these are truly important issues. I
was surprised to see that the big news, almost a scandal, was
something that happened almost accidentally at the United Nations
yesterday. Before I came here I found myself obliged to write a
brief clarifying note. I called it &quot;About greeting president
Clinton&quot; and it reads thus:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;After the lunch offered by the UN
Secretary General, at the end of the Millennium Summit opening
session, we were asked to move to an adjacent room for the
official photo. We walked toward that room, one following the
other, through a narrow space between tables. Then, I perceived
President Clinton standing hardly four meters ahead greeting
various Heads of States passing by him. He was shaking
everyone&#146;s hand out of courtesy. I could not run away to
avoid him, neither could he. In both cases it would have been a
shameful cowardice. Thus, I followed the others. In about two
minutes I was in front of him. Just like everyone before me, I
stopped for a few seconds and with due courtesy and dignity I
greeted him (APPLAUSE) and he did exactly the same thing; then, I
proceed forward. Anything else would have been rude and improper.
Everything lasted less than 20 seconds.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;That simple event was soon known and
various media reported it kindly. There were soon rumors, and
official press spokesmen lacking the right information began
giving different versions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;The Miami Mafia grew hysteric. To
them, the President had committed a great crime. They can be such
bigots!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;As for myself, I am pleased with my
respectful and civilized behavior toward the President of the
country which hosted the Summit.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Today, more rumors and official news
reporting that I had walked over to the place where the President
was standing. I had no need to do that. Everyone knows that no
honorable Cuban would ever beg for a greeting or any honor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This would be all. I ask your forgiveness
for having gone over my time. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>
