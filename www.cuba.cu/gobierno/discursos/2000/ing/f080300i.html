<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was announced that there would be two
surprises and you surely assumed that I would speak; anyone could have
guessed that. (Laughter)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But never in my life have I had to work
so pressed and in such haste as in the last two hours organizing papers
and figures and putting pages in order, because at times like these one
needs to be precise and exact. I want to thank singer Silvio [Rodr&iacute;guez]
who saved my life although he may have lost his voice. (Laughter and applause)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dear comrades:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some people have been wondering why I have
not spoken at any of the rallies and about five days ago I explained that
it was not necessary.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not know if this is an exception or
a combination, since there is this rally here today although the Federation
of Cuban Women Congress is not over yet, and this year I have not attended
the Congress at all even although I am usually present at congresses every
day and every hour. Anyway, today I have something to say.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am not going to talk about Eli&aacute;n
or, let us say, about Eli&aacute;n’s case. What has been done with this
child is truly a monstrosity but I think there is still a greater monstrosity:
the Cuban Adjustment Act, and I will prove it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The following are reports taken from wire
stories out of Miami:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"February 28.- A new group of five Cuban
immigrants arrived today, Monday, on the Florida coasts, presumably transported
by smugglers, the U.S. authorities announced.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"According to the U.S. Coast Guard Service,
the group, which arrived this morning in the Florida keys, paid 5,000 US
dollars for the trip from Cuba."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"February 28.- On Monday, the U.S. Coast
Guard detained seven undocumented Cubans who arrived on the Florida coasts
in two groups, according to a spokesman from this agency.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The patrol picked up a Havana couple in
Hollywood (Florida), who had departed the night before from the port of
Mariel (Cuba) in a speedboat. They said that they had paid 5,000 US dollars
each to a smuggler, according to spokesman Joe Mellia.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The couple claimed that another six Cubans
were with them on the boat but the Coast Guard did not detain any other
Cubans, nor the presumed smuggler, in Hollywood, the spokesman added".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"March 2.- Twenty undocumented Cubans arrived
on an island off Florida on Thursday in a makeshift raft built from empty
oil barrels, reported a U.S. Coast Guard agent. There were 15 men, three
women and two girls."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"March 3.- A total of 48 undocumented Cubans
arrived on the coasts of Florida in just one day, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman
confirmed Friday.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"In the early morning hours of Friday,
police in Monroe County (Florida) detained a group of 28 Cubans who had
arrived Thursday night at a beach on Marathon Key, in the state’s southernmost
archipelago, according to spokesman Joe Mellia. There were 10 men, 10 women,
five boys and three girls."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We already read what they reported about
the other boat, with 15 men, three women and two girls on board.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All of these are public wire stories.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"March 6.- A group of nine Cubans arrived
Monday to Key Largo, Florida, which means that a total of 89 undocumented
Cubans have arrived in the United States during the first six days of the
month, according to a Coast Guard spokesman."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There were actually 107 in five days, if
to those 89 you add the 18 who were intercepted on the high seas and will
be returned tomorrow, Thursday, by the U.S. Coast Guard Service.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When we realized that a high number of
Cubans were being transported to the United States on speedboats coming
from Florida which returned overloaded, or on flimsy boats financed from
Miami, today, at 9:30 a.m. we requested from the U.S. Interests Section
in Havana to urgently inform us of how many women and children were among
the 89 Cubans who had arrived on the U.S. coasts between March 2 and 6.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs filed the request and asked for an swift
response.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At approximately 4:00 p.m. this afternoon,
the Interests Section was asked if there was any response on the information
requested. The answer was that they still had no official information although
they had made numerous calls to Miami. They said that approximately 140
people had arrived in the last seven days, the majority of them as part
of smuggling operations, and added that they would insist in seeking out
information even if they did not expect to have any until at least tomorrow.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We really needed precise figures on this
matter today. We are talking about 140 Cubans, according to the Interests
Section.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As we did not receive a response today
on these figures, and tomorrow is not today, then based on what was reported
by the wire services on March 2 and 3 on the 48 people who arrived in two
groups --28 in one group and 20 in the other-- noting that there were women
and children on each boat, a total of 23 out of the 48 arriving on the
U.S. coasts this way --almost half, just one short of half the 48-- and
applying this ratio to the 89 mentioned in the March 6 wire story, we can
assume that there were around 24 women, possibly almost all of them mothers,
and 19 children. Based on these calculations we have an approximate idea
of the number of women and children who set out during those five days.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the same method is applied to the total
of 107 who set out between March 2 and 6, the figures would rise to 28
women and 21 children.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In fact, I have had to do a lot of calculations,
multiplying and dividing, because these figures had not been filled in
yet. I knew how I would have to work out the totals and I was waiting to
see if there was some response. There were still blanks where these figures
needed to be filled in. I thought I would be able to work out the totals
quickly, but I have had to fill up a whole page with numbers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If I have made any mistakes in my calculations,
then for those who like to analyze and verify figures --like I generally
do-- I offer my apologies. I even used fractions, but I could not talk
in terms of fractions of people. If it was closer to the higher number,
I rounded up; but I was quite conservative with my calculations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In summary, at this rate, there are 38
women and 28 children arriving per week, which means an average of five
women --I rounded down there-- and four children every day.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Undoubtedly, the U.S. government is doing
everything possible at this moment to return the kidnapped child to his
father and grandmothers. This is demonstrated by the fact that yesterday,
48 hours before the hearing scheduled for tomorrow morning, Thursday, March
9, it was announced that the deputy Solicitor General of the Department
of Justice, Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler, will present the oral arguments at the
hearing, which is highly unusual. The responsibility for presenting the
arguments at a federal court hearing has been given to someone who is practically
a deputy Minister of Justice.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We appreciate this because it increases
the possibility of a relatively quick solution to the problem, which is
crucial for the mental and even physical health of this tormented child.
I say that "it increases the possibility of a quick solution." However,
that does not mean that there is any certainty that this is what will happen
in a few days or weeks.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now then, and this is most important, how
significant would Eli&aacute;n’s return be if four children a day and 28
children a week are taken out of the country risking the same fate or even
worse than the shipwrecked boy who survived this tragedy?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the ill-fated voyage organized by an
irresponsible individual with a dire personal background, who would have
never been granted a visa to enter the United States, a total of 11 people
died, including women, old people and children, or one child. I do not
have precise information on this figure, but what is certain is that at
least one other child died.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ten days before the March 6 wire story,
another one out of Miami brought news of a similar tragedy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Actually, the first reports arrived on
February 26, but I prefer to use the wire story from February 28, which
provides the essential information with greater detail. It was a public
wire story, and this is how it read:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Without food or water, a group of rafters
who survived nine days at sea before being rescued off the coasts of Florida
were forced to drink their own urine, according to what they told a local
newspaper.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Three of a total of four survivors will
be released from hospital today, Monday, while the fourth remains in critical
condition in a Miami hospital since Friday, following the voyage in which
two other immigrants died.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Three of the survivors, Jorge Nicol&aacute;s
Gonz&aacute;lez, 33, Oscar L&aacute;zaro Garc&iacute;a, 27 and Reynier
Alvarez, 22 recounted their odyssey to The Miami Herald.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The group recalled that upon waking on
Friday, shortly before being rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard Service, they
found two of their companions dead.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The fourth survivor, Ernesto Molina Ramos,
29, remains in the intensive care unit of South Shore Hospital, where he
was admitted with circulatory problems due to saltwater ingestion. He could
also be suffering from gangrene in one of his legs."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I understand that they later amputated
one or both of his legs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"According to Sara Abreu, Garc&iacute;a’s
stepmother, the state of suffering on the raft had reached such heights
that Molina Ramos had given his companions permission to eat his body if
he died.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The outboard motor broke down shortly
after they had left the island," they explained.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another wire story two days later reported
that Ernesto Molina Ramos had also died; in other words, three of the six
lost their lives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There could be nothing better than this
case to illustrate what I was saying about the monstrosity of the Cuban
Adjustment Act.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Who were the six individuals who went through
this cruel and tragic ordeal?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have their names here with me in alphabetical
order and some background information.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Reynier Alvarez Vald&eacute;s. Date of
birth --the wire story I read from earlier gave his age as 22-- September
7, 1973. Age, 26. He had relatives living abroad, including his father,
who had never accepted his paternity. He had no criminal record.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">V&iacute;ctor Manuel Berm&uacute;dez Pav&oacute;n.
Date of birth, June 15, 1958. Age, 41. No criminal records although he
moved in clearly antisocial circles.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Jorge Gonz&aacute;lez Aguerreve. Date of
birth, December 6, 1967. Age, 32. His records show the following:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prison sentence for petty larceny in 1992,
Marianao Municipal Court. Served sentence in Valle Grande in January of
1992; released in February upon payment of fine.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prison sentence for assault and battery in
1991. Prosecuted for embezzlement. Trial pending for theft of a truckload
of chickens.</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ernesto Jorge Travieso L&oacute;pez. Date
of birth, June 20, 1963. Age, 36. His records show the following:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Applied to emigrate on October 17, 1986; application
denied June 11, 1990, four years later.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prison sentences for illegally leaving the
country in 1990 to 1991 and 1991 to 1992, in two separate cases.</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Note: he requested a visa in 1986 and was
turned down. At the U.S. Interests Section they pick and choose and they
are rigorous when it comes to giving out visas. It depends on who the applicant
is. A counterrevolutionary gets a visa quickly while someone with a certain
kind of personal history does not get one. Yet, he still attempted to leave
the country twice and was even detained for a time on both occasions, but
was then set free.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He was an ex-convict for common offenses
and not only for leaving the country illegally, according to file No. 0255040.
He had a sentence of several years pending for theft. As he was denied
a visa, he immediately resorted to the option of leaving the country illegally.
But, of course, he would be welcomed once he set foot on U.S. soil, even
if it was on one of the many tiny keys off the Florida state.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ernesto Molina Ramos. Date of birth, January
10, 1972. Age, 28. He tried to leave the country illegally in December
of 1999 and was returned by the Coast Guard Service that same month. He
had not even bothered to go to the Interests Section since he would have
never been granted a visa. Last December, when Eli&aacute;n’s case was
already underway, he tried to leave and was intercepted and turned back.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Based on the existing agreements, they
send back those they intercept but they intercept fewer everyday. They
have always kept a few, just over 20%, no one knows exactly why. In my
opinion, this policy is related to the demands of the extremists’ mob who
would like to see the migratory agreement removed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Well, they sent him back and he returned
to his own home with the same status he had when he left. On February 18
he left for the United States again. He left with another individual who
had also tried to leave in December and was intercepted along with him
and returned. These two who had been returned were among the six who tried
to leave the country illegally and enter the United States two months later.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The records show the following:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prosecuted for theft in the Boyeros People’s
Municipal Court. Issued a warning in 1998 for other offenses.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prison sentence for aggravated theft; sentenced
to nine years in jail, to expire in December of 2000. Released on parole
on July 18, 1996; in other words, he had served around six years of his
sentence.</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Oscar L&aacute;zaro Garc&iacute;a P&eacute;rez.
Date of birth, June 27, 1971. Age, 28. He had attempted to leave the country
illegally in December of 1999 with three other people including the one
mentioned earlier. They were traveling on a flimsy boat and were returned
by the Coast Guard. He tried it again two months later on this fatal voyage.
How many times would a person try to leave under these conditions and why?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The records show the following:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Application for definitive exit permit on
April 16, 1986, at the Immigration and Aliens Department section in Marianao,
application No. 86G601542.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prison sentence for aggravated theft. Served
sentence at Combinado del Este penitentiary from September of 1992 through
April of 1994. Case No. 556/92, file No. 1282547.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prosecuted for petty larceny following complaint
No. 436/94 filed at the Sixth Unit of the National Revolutionary Police
in Marianao.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prosecuted for aggravated theft, case No.
6733/92. This might be the case that resulted in the prison sentence.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prosecuted for damages, no date specified.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prosecuted for issuing threats, complaint
No. 9050/92.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prison sentence for acting as an accessory
in a homicide case and for possession of an illegal arm with a blade. Sentenced
to three years; entered prison in 1989 and released on parole on September
11, 1990. File No. 387890.</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">As you can see, among people who have committed
crimes, people who have trials pending or who are on parole there is a
high potential for individuals who do not abide by any laws or set of rules.
They try to leave illegally and they do it. They are sent back if intercepted
but the majority of them are not. At this moment, over 80% of those who
leave the country illegally are not intercepted. They achieve their goal
if their boats do not sink, if no tragedies occur; and if they are sent
back, they try it again.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">According to the odds of success, very
few people need to give it a second try because they have over an 80% probability
of making it in one attempt, and their odds increase even further in a
second one. The odds of success are doubled. There is no need to try three
times because the chances of making it are 170 in their favor to only 30
against.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How can these things be prevented if the
United States denies them visas but when they leave the country illegally
they are welcomed with open arms without any questions asked from Cuba
--the U.S. never does-- about their criminal records? They are granted
legal residence and immediate authorization to seek employment, something
recently added to the interpretation of the infamous Cuban Adjustment Act.
Really, what kind of employment are they going to seek if they have never
done anything in their lives --in the cases I am referring to-- aside from
living outside the law, without ever seeking employment?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What sense is there in returning the people
intercepted at sea to Cuba where they are sent back to their homes, in
accordance with the migratory agreements in force, when they can immediately
try to leave the country illegally, risking their lives over and over again,
until they finally reach the U.S. coasts?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thanks to the Cuban Adjustment Act, there
will not be a single adventurer or criminal with prison sentences already
served or still pending, on parole or out on bail, who does not dream of
traveling this way to the country where there are more things to steal
and more opportunities for crime. Of course, I do not mean that everyone
who tries or has tried to illegally leave the country is a criminal; many
of them are ordinary people who have not been granted a visa or have spent
many years waiting for one and have thus opted for the privileges of the
Cuban Adjustment Act.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ten years were practically lost after signing
the first agreement with Reagan, which pledged to grant up to 20,000 visas
annually. Notice how they interpreted that agreement, granting just over
1000 visas in one year, then decreasing that to less than 1000 because
according to their interpretation they only had to give out three visas
to say that they had complied with the agreement to grant up to 20,000
visas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What did they do in collusion with the
infamous Cuban-American National Foundation, their creature, to which they
wanted to provide a broad base of membership? Many of the visas that should
have been extended to people living in Cuba to be reunited with their relatives
in the United States --the people targeted by the agreement-- were instead
granted to Cubans living in other countries, in any of the many countries
where there are Cubans, who would not have been able to get into the United
States otherwise, since you cannot get there from these countries on speedboats
or rafts carried by the gulf stream. That is what they did with these visas.
Meanwhile, around 180,000 Cubans living in Cuba, I do not remember the
exact figure, were kept waiting.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Throughout all those years, less than 10,000
visas were issued. I think that agreement remained in force for nine years
until it was replaced by those signed in 1994 and 1995 with the Clinton
administration. As a result, the new agreements stipulated the issuing
of no less than 20,000 visas. This means that they can grant more, if they
want, but no less. They actually have been meeting this quota. There was
a period in which they were only granting 15,000 because they asked us
to help them solve the problem of the several thousand Cubans held at the
Guant&aacute;namo Naval Base. They asked for our cooperation and we obliged,
that was how thousands of those sheltered at this facility were able to
travel to the United States over the course of two or three years. Part
of the 20,000 quota was used for this purpose but then it was reestablished
and they have even, on occasion, issued 2,000 or 3,000 visas in excess
of the 20,000 stipulated. That is a fact.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How many lives has the Cuban Adjustment
Act cost our people throughout the 33 years it has been in force? How many
lives of innocent children, torn from their schools and placed in great
danger by mothers and fathers acting irresponsibly or fooled by illusions
or by the vicious campaigns and incitement of the overwhelming propaganda
originated in a country which, on the other hand, subjects ours to a blockade
aimed at destroying our people through hunger and disease?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the six individuals on that flimsy boat
had all drowned; if Eli&aacute;n and the other two survivors had died along
with the 11 others, perhaps no one would have ever heard about their deaths.
Why does this happen?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If it were not for the Cuban Adjustment
Act, we would never have seen the emergence of this disturbing and criminal
smuggling of human beings, which now uses techniques developed by drug
traffickers, with speedboats equipped with three powerful outboard motors
that no Coast Guard could intercept.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Whether traveling on slow makeshift rafts
or speedboats, only 18 individuals out of 107 were intercepted. In other
words, 16.9% of those who tried to reach the United States were not able
to do so, and they still have the prerogative of trying again, something
truly absurd and unjustifiable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Not a single smuggler has been arrested
in the United States, not a single one! The Coast Guard Service has been
the victim of ambushes, traps and provocations, along with media campaigns
showing footage aimed at discrediting and demoralizing it, and thus further
reducing its effectiveness. Only Cuba has adopted serious measures to fight
the trafficking of immigrants such as laws that establish stiffer sanctions
for this crime, including life sentences, and others that severely regulate
the ownership and construction of boats and that step up vigilance and
prevention with the support of the population in order to hinder or obstruct
illegal migration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are United States residents implicated
in the smuggling of immigrants using speedboats registered in the United
States, and through contracts and payments made in Miami, thus fundamentally
violating the laws of the United States. We have 60 of these people under
arrest here, who were caught between April of 1998 and February 20 of this
year.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For many months, we have been waiting for
the United States to accept our offer to extradite them to that country
where they reside, something they so strongly demand when it comes to drug
traffickers. They practically force many countries in Latin America to
comply with the extradition of nationals of those countries or individuals
residing there. It suffices with the intention of sending drugs to the
United States. However, that is not the case when it comes to people who
traffic in human beings.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those traffickers, 60 of them, are in prison
here. We have already tried and sentenced some others because during their
misadventures two of them caused the death of some of the people involved
and risked the lives of children on board these boats, thus the main crime
was committed here, not there. As for the other cases, the fundamental
crime was committed in the United States, where they live and where, I
will reiterate with greater precision, the smugglers acquire, buy or rent
the boats, make the contracts, receive payment for their services and illegally
bring in the immigrants.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Therefore, based on the aforementioned
principle, in the two cases where the main crime was committed in our country’s
territorial waters we have held two trials and enforced the new sanctions.
But, the other cases involve U.S. residents whose main crimes were committed
there. These people remain in prison. Their families in the United States
are growing impatient and demanding that they be sent back; even some of
their relatives in Cuba are demanding the same. However, there is fear
to make them stand trial in Miami, and anyone can understand why. There
is fear of the economic influence, the alleged electoral influence and
the challenges and disturbances of the Cuban-American mob and their allies
in Congress, from both parties, something truly humiliating and demeaning
to a major power.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the other hand, none of that country’s
leaders dare to admit the truth or say a word about the actual cause of
the sensitive problem created with the kidnapping of the Cuban child. Nobody
talks about the diabolical killing machine that takes the lives of women,
children, old people and men, with or without criminal records.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The United States does not have any right
to promote the death of people from this country, whether they are criminals
or not. The diabolical killing machine that claims lives and provokes tragedies
is nothing other than the Cuban Adjustment Act. That is the true reason
behind the sensitive problem created with the kidnapping of a boy who had
not even turned six years old then, who is being unfairly retained in that
country and who was placed under the custody of a person who lacks even
the minimal ethical requirements to assume this duty. We know this very
well since we have learned even more as we have looked further into the
kind of person that has this child in his power.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is because of all this that I told you
at the beginning that I would be speaking to you today about a greater
monstrosity, something more serious than the kidnapping of Eli&aacute;n.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will fight against this vicious law,
this heinous and criminal law. We will keep fighting until it has been
repealed. Only then can we be certain that thousands of innocent children
will not be illegally uprooted from their homeland, from their schools,
from their identities, and subjected to extreme dangers, or even death.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No matter how much it hurts, the Revolution
will continue to respect as something sacred the parental rights of our
citizens and their right to leave with their children, by legal and safe
means, for other countries, to opt for another identity, another kind of
education, another culture, another flag. It does not matter how many children
the homeland loses in this way. However, if it is attempted by resorting
to the abusive use of force, thus destroying the innocence, the identity
and the future of a Cuban child, which we feel is the greatest honor and
the greatest future offered to any child today, then we would all be willing
to fight and die for the sake of just one.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Homeland of Death!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We will win!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
