DR.FIDEL CASTRO RUZ, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CUBA, TO THE
RALLY HELD AT &quot;COMANDER ERNESTO CHE GUEVARA&quot; SQUARE IN
VILLA CLARA COMMEMORATING THE 47</b><sup><b>TH</b></sup><b>
ANNIVERSARY OF THE ATTACK ON THE MONCADA BARRACKS ON JULY 26,
1953. VILLA CLARA, JULY 29, 2000</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">People of Villa Clara,</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Fellow countrymen,</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Guests:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Everything changes, even the time and the
way our mass rallies are held. That was the case the past May Day
and this July 26<sup>th</sup>. The tenacious and unrelenting
struggle to correct a major injustice against a Cuban child, his
father and family, as well as the great massive battle of ideas
waged by our people throughout seven months, have deeply enriched
our revolutionary experience. We now have a great mobilizing
capacity, more organization and better discipline. Hundreds of
new talented speakers, many of them children, teenagers and
youths have emerged everywhere as an irrefutable proof of the
unbeatable educational work of the Revolution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">New and efficient ways to expose our people
and the world to our truth have been developed. Art and oratory,
culture and the revolutionary message have merged almost
inseparably in our historical process. The knowledge, general
culture and political consciousness of the Cuban people are
growing swiftly. Long speeches to people rallied in uncomfortable
places under a hot sun will no longer be necessary to delve into
complex issues and explain events which are being debated and
analyzed almost on a daily basis on television, the radio and the
newspapers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We are holding this rally today at this
Revolutionary Square in front of the mausoleum keeping the
remains of the reinforcement detachment made up by Che [Guevara]
and his brave comrades who perished in a noble and generous
struggle in other nations of the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">One by one they were sought for and found
dispersed in remote places; one by one their bones were
identified. It is our homeland&#146;s privilege to keep in this
sanctuary of solidarity and internationalism the protagonists of
one of the most beautiful pages in the history of the Americas.
Before Bolívar&#146;s and Martí&#146;s dreams of unity can be
realized, our Americas are already integrated here. Argentineans,
Bolivians, Peruvians and Cubans --even a daughter of the country
that was the birthplace of the first man who dreamed of a
socialist world-- are forever resting together in this place.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">These tombs, whose imposing presence convey
an encouraging message, remind us that we are not alone in this
July 26<sup>th</sup> celebration in Villa Clara, that here with
us are also those who died in the battle where one after the
other the streets and the buildings of this gallant city were
recovered from the claws of the tyrant. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">But, even after we had occupied the cities
of Santiago de Cuba and Santa Clara, the struggle did not stop
for a second. Our troops continued their impetuous march with the
unanimous support of the workers and all of the people up to the
total collapse of the regime less than 48 hour later. It was not
a forcibly take over with the use of weapons; it was a
Revolution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Soon, we all realized that the true master
was not the overthrown tyrant; the real master was another one a
thousand times more powerful. Under common circumstances it would
have seemed a simple theory or political hypothesis. Those were
times when many still believed that the peoples&#146; sovereignty
and independence were sacred universal principles accepted and
respected by all.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Our people learned their first lesson with
the massive departure for the United States --where their
fortunes were kept-- of hundreds of big plunderers of the public
coffers and the worst war criminals who had tortured and murdered
thousands of our sons and daughters. But, that was only the
beginning. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The leaders of that nation immediately cut
off all credits and began an intensive campaign of slanders,
which they commonly use to justify their actions and that still
goes on today. Then, the pretext was the exemplary punishment of
the war criminals who failed to escape the country as well as the
nationalization and confiscation of farms, real states and other
unearned riches accumulated in almost seven years of tyranny.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A crucially needed land reform, which had
been decreed four and a half months after the victory of the
Revolution, aroused the wrath of the empire. Several of its big
companies owned extensive areas of the best land in the country.
Thus, the Revolution was unequivocally sentenced to death. It
seemed quite easy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">That marked the beginning of the air raids
by pirate planes coming from the United States against sugar cane
plantations, sugar factories and even cities; terrorist actions,
armed gangs and dirty war; attempts against the life of leaders,
raids from the sea against coastal facilities and the merchant
and fishing fleet; the Bay of Pigs mercenary invasion and the
seemingly final and irresistible weapon against a small
underdeveloped nation: total blockade and economic warfare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">One after another the corrupted oligarchies
and bourgeois governments in countries of this hemisphere sharing
our same language, culture and colonial history --except for one
Latin American country-- joined the United States in that
fratricidal action. Our sugar quota of over 3 million tons
obtained in the course of a century was redistributed among
accomplices and traitors. Everything was done in the name of
&quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot;, which seldom if
ever existed in many of those same countries. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Once the mercenary invasion had been
defeated, other plans were worked out for a direct invasion of
Cuba by the U.S. military forces as irrefutably proven by
declassified official documents. There was even a real
possibility of a nuclear war.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Efforts were made to totally isolate Cuba;
sabotages were carried out against our merchant fleet and our
airliners. A civilian plane was blown up in flight carrying over
70 passengers including our youth fencing team, which had won all
the gold medals in a Central American Tournament. Biologic
warfare has been used to attack people, animals and plants; bombs
have been set up in hotels and other tourist facilities and other
terrorist actions have been directly executed either by entities
run by the U.S. government or through puppet organizations. Our
people have had to endure all of that for four decades.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The collapse of the socialist camp and the
disintegration of the Soviet Union deprived our country of its
basic markets, fuel, and food supplies, raw materials, equipment
and spare parts and led it into an exceptionally difficult
situation. It was disgusting that the moment was
opportunistically chosen by the U.S. administration to try to
deal the final blow to the Revolution using the Torricelli and
Helms-Burton Acts and tens of amendments attached to major
legislation in the U.S. Congress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">For several years many hopelessly awaited
the news that the Revolution no longer existed. However, our
people resisted with determination and that unprecedented feat is
for us a legitimate source of pride.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Nothing could prevent the extraordinary
social achievements that are today the subject of admiration of
every honest person in the world. Nothing could prevent the
golden pages written in the history book of internationalism and
solidarity with others. Nothing can write off the example we have
set for the world. Our patriotic sentiments are deeper and our
internationalist beliefs have multiplied with the blossoming in
the soul of the Cuban people of that most beautiful of
Martí&#146;s ideas, that is, &quot;Humanity is Homeland&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We take pride in those sentiments that led
José Martí to Dos Ríos and Che Guevara and his comrades to
Ñacahuazú, Río Grande, Quebrada del Yuro and La Higuera; that
led hundreds of thousands of Cuban internationalist fighters to
Angola, Cuito Cuanavale and the banks of the Cunene river along
the Namibian border providing a decisive cooperation to the
sister nations of Africa for the defeat of one of the most
revolting and hateful bulwarks of racism and fascism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Those sentiments have led dozens of
thousands of medical doctors, teachers, technicians and
construction workers to many distant places in the world to save
lives and relief the pain, to restore and preserve health, to
educate and contribute to the well-being and development of
millions of people, as they have led us to offer our educational
facilities and universities to tens of thousands of youth from
the Third World.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">That is a legacy that Cuba --threatened,
harassed and blockaded as it is by the mightiest power on Earth--
has contributed to the future world which can only be saved by
and built on those pillars of solidarity and internationalism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The theoreticians and advocates of the
imperial policies still dream that the revolution, which could
not be destroyed with such perfidious and criminal means, might
be subverted with such appealing methods as the one they have
called &quot;the policy of people-to-people contact&quot;. It is
all right with us; we are willing to take up the challenge but
they should play fair. They should put an end to their
conditioning and remove the murderous Cuban Adjustment Act, the
Torricelli and Helms-Burton Acts and the scores of legal albeit
immoral amendments opportunistically inserted in their
legislation. They should completely end the deadly blockade and
the economic warfare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Likewise, they should respect the
constitutional right of their students, workers, intellectuals,
businessmen and Americans in general to visit our country, to do
business, to trade and invest unrestrictedly --if they so wish--
without ridiculous fear, the same way we allow our people to
freely travel to and live in the United States. We shall see then
if that is the way they can destroy the Cuban Revolution, which
is definitely their purpose.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It is not our intention to disturb the
sweet dreams of those who believe that to be possible. It is
simply out of courtesy that I am warning them that the Cuban
Revolution can neither be destroyed by force nor seduced by fine
words.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">José Martí said that trenches of ideas
are worth more than trenches of stone, and we share that thought,
although he never said that the latter were unnecessary. A double
trench of stones and ideas presently defends Cuba: the former
against brutality. That one is made up by our people&#146;s
determination to fight to the end, whatever the consequences, so
that the intelligent weapons and the most sophisticated means
coming out of our potential aggressors&#146; advanced centers
that turn out death instruments are rendered useless.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">But, there is also a gigantic trench of
beliefs and ideas strong enough to thwart the whole arsenal of
lies, demagoguery and hypocrisy used by the imperialists to
deceive the world. Also, with well-founded ideas of justice and a
sound general and political culture, our people can defend their
identity and be protected from the demi-cultures emanating from
the dehumanized, selfish and irresponsible consumer societies. We
can also be winners in that field and, in fact, we will.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">History is on our side because the unfair
and globalized political and economic order imposed on the world
is unsustainable and it will collapse rather sooner than later.
Nature cannot put up with the aggression against its resources
and the environment. The billions of poor people increasingly
populating this planet will become ungovernable. Neither the
immigration laws nor the walled borders will contain them.
Civilization itself is in jeopardy and the politicians,
regardless of their haughtiness or inefficiency, will have to
understand that in this age and on this planet there is no
alternative to peace and close cooperation among the peoples.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The people in our country are very quickly
acquiring a deep knowledge and a growing awareness of these
realities. The enormous and combative march seen in our
country&#146;s capital barely 72 hours ago is evidence of this.
Also this massive, well-organized, enthusiastic, exciting and
beautiful rally in Santa Clara confirm it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">That monument, by which we stand now, is
like a beacon showing us the path to the future. The immortal,
rather than mortal, remains of our comrades resting in their
tombs are proof of what human beings can do for a world of
justice, peace and fraternity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Glory be to those who died at the Moncada
barracks, at the Bay of Pigs, in the Escambray area, on the
mountains and the cities of Cuba to make possible the dreams of
that July 26<sup>th</sup>!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Glory be to Che Guevara and those who
fought and perished with him!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Glory be to those who died in Guinea
Bissau, in the east of Congo, in Ethiopia, in Angola, in Cuito
Cuanavale, in the proximity of the Namibian border and elsewhere!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Glory be to the teachers and civilian
workers who perished in the line of internationalist duty!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Honor, gratitude and appreciation be to the
thousands of medical doctors and health workers who are saving
lives in remote corners of the world!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Honor and glory be to the people capable of
such deeds!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">People of Villa Clara, victors over
difficulties and obstacles, who have won the honor of holding the
commemoration of the 47<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the day when
an example and an idea lit a flame that today expands throughout
the world, congratulations!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Fellow countrymen of Cuba, carry on!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Ever onward to victory! </font></p>
