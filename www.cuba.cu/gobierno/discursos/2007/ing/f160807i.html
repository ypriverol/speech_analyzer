relations which, in your opinion, ought to exist between Cuba and the United States,
the government of the United States will undoubtedly adopt the measures
conducive to a final and authorized treaty between the peoples of both nations,

and the </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>United States</span><span

style='font-size:14.0pt'>, a committee of five members was appointed and charged
with studying and proposing a procedure that would lead to the stated goal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     On February 15, Governor Wood invited the members
of the committee to go fishing and hosted a banquet in Batabanó, the main
access route to the </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Isle of
 Pines</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>, as it was known then, also

lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'> troops which had intervened in the Cuban
War of Independence.  It was there in Batabanó that he revealed to them a
letter from the Secretary of War, Elihu Root, containing the basic aspects of
the future Platt Amendment. According to instructions from </span><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Washington</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, relations between </span><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Cuba</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>
and the </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>United States</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'> were to abide by several aspects.  The
fifth of these was that, in order to make it easier for the </span><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>United States</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'> to fulfill such tasks as were placed under its
responsibility by the above mentioned provisions, and for its own defense, the </span><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>United States</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'> could acquire title, and preserve it, for lands to be
used for naval bases and maintain these in certain specific points.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     Upon learning of the conditions demanded by the </span><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>U.S.</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'> government, the Cuban Constitutional Assembly, on </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>February 27, 1901</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, passed a position that was opposed to that of the
U.S. Executive, eliminating therein the establishment of naval bases.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     The </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
  14.0pt'>U.S.</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'> government made
an agreement with Orville H. Platt, Republican Senator from </span><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Connecticut</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, to present an amendment to the proposed Army
Appropriations Bill which would make the establishment of American naval bases
on Cuban soil a <i>fait accompli</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     In the Amendment, passed by the U.S. Senate on </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>February 27, 1901</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'> and by the House of Representatives on March 1, and
sanctioned by President McKinley the following day, as a rider attached to the
“Bill granting credit to the Army for the fiscal year ending on </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>June 30, 1902</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>,” the article mentioning the naval bases was drafted
as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     “Art. VII.- That to enable the United States to
maintain the independence of Cuba, and to protect the people thereof, as well
as for its own defense, the government of Cuba will sell or lease to the United
States lands necessary for coaling or naval stations at certain specified
points to be agreed upon with the President of the United States.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     Article VIII adds:  “…the government of </span><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Cuba</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'> will embody the foregoing provisions in a permanent
treaty with the </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>United States</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     The speedy passage of the Amendment by the U.S. Congress
was due to the circumstance of it coming close to the conclusion of the
legislative term and to the fact that President McKinley had a clear majority
in both Houses so that the Amendment could be passed without any problem.  It
became a United States Law when, on March 4, McKinley was sworn in for his
second presidential term in office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     Some members of the Constitutional Convention maintained
the view that they were not empowered to adopt the Amendment requested by the </span><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>United States</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'> since this implied limitations on the independence
and sovereignty of the </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Republic</span><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'> of </span><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Cuba</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>. 
Thus, the military governor Leonard Wood hastened to issue a new Military Order
on </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>March 12, 1901</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'> where it was declared that the Convention
was empowered to adopt the measures whose constitutionality was in question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     Other Convention members, such as Manuel
Sanguily, held the opinion that the Assembly should be dissolved rather than
adopt measures that so drastically offended the dignity and sovereignty of the
people of </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Cuba</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>.  But during the session of </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>March 7, 1901</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, a committee was appointed yet again in order to
draft an answer to Governor Wood; the presentation of this was entrusted to
Juan Gualberto Gómez who recommended, among other things, rejecting the clause concerning
the leasing of coaling or naval stations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     Juan Gualberto Gómez maintained the most severe
criticism of the Platt Amendment.  On April 1, he tabled a debate of the presentation
where he challenged the document on the grounds that it contravened the
principles of the Treaty of Paris and of the Joint Resolution.  But the
Convention suspended the debate on Juan Gualberto Gómez’s presentation and
decided to send another committee &quot;to ascertain the motives and intentions
of the government of the United States about any and all details referring to
the establishment of a definitive order to relations, both political and
economic, between Cuba and the United States, and to negotiate with the
government itself, the bases for agreement on those extremes that would be
proposed to the Convention for a final solution.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     Subsequently, a committee was elected that would
travel to Washington, made up of Domingo Méndez Capote, Diego Tamayo, Pedro
González Llorente, Rafael Portuondo Tamayo and Pedro Betancourt;  they arrived
in the United States on April 24, 1901.  The next day, they met with Root and
Wood who had earlier traveled back to his country for this purpose. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     The American government hastened to publicly
declare that the committee would be visiting </span><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Washington</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
14.0pt'> on their own initiative, with no invitation or official status.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     Root, Secretary of War, met with the committee on
April 25 and 26, 1901 and categorically informed them that “the United States’
right to impose the much debated clauses had been proclaimed for three-quarters
of a century in the face of the American and European world and they were not willing
to give it up to the point of putting their own safety in jeopardy.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     United States officials reiterated that none of
the Platt Amendment clauses undermined the sovereignty and independence of
Cuba; on the contrary, they would preserve them, and it was clarified that
intervention would only occur in the case of severe disturbances, and only with
the objective of maintaining order and internal peace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     The committee presented its report in a secret
session on </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>May 7, 1901</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>.  Within the committee there were severe
discrepancies about the Platt Amendment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     On May </span><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>28, a</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'> paper drafted by Villuendas, Tamayo and Quesada was
tabled for debate; it accepted the Amendment with some clarifications and
recommended the signing of a treaty on trade reciprocity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     This paper was approved by a vote of 15 to 14,
but the </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>United States</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'> government didn’t accept that solution. It
informed through Governor Wood that it would only accept the Amendment without
qualifiers, and  warned the Convention with an ultimatum that, since the Platt
Amendment was “a statute passed by the Legislature of the United States, the
President is obliged to carry it out as it is.  He cannot change or alter it,
add or take anything out. The executive action demanded by the statute is the withdrawal
of the American Army from Cuba, and the statute authorizes this action when,
and only when, a Constitutional government has been established which contains,
either in its body or in appendices, certain categorical provisions, specified
in the statute (...)  Then if these provisions are found in the Constitution, the
President will be authorized to withdraw the Army;  if  he does not find them
there, then he will not be authorized to withdraw the Army…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The United States Secretary of War sent a
letter to the Cuban Constitutional Assembly where he stated that the Platt
Amendment should be passed in its entirety with no clarifications, because in
that way it would appear as a rider to the Army Appropriations Bill; he
indicated that, otherwise, his country's military forces would not be pulled
out of </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Cuba</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     On </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>June
 12, 1901</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>, during another
secret session of the Constitutional Assembly, the incorporation of the Platt
Amendment as an appendix to the Constitution of the Republic passed on February
21 was put to the vote:  16 delegates voted aye and 11 voted nay.  Bravo
Correoso, Robau, Gener and Rius Rivera were absent from the session, abstaining
from voting in favor of such a monstrosity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     The worst thing about the Amendment was the
hypocrisy, the deceit, the Machiavellianism and the cynicism with which they
concocted the plan to take over </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Cuba</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>, to the lengths of publicly proclaiming
the same arguments made by John Quincy Adams in 1823, about the apple which
would fall because of gravity.  This apple finally did fall, but it was rotten,
just as many Cuban intellectuals had foreseen for almost half a century, from
José Martí in the 1880’s right up to Julio Antonio Mella, assassinated in
January of 1929.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>     Nobody better than Leonard Wood himself to
describe what the Platt Amendment would mean for </span><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Cuba</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>
in two sections of a confidential letter to his fellow in the adventure,

thing to do now is to seek annexation.  This, however, will take some time, and
during the period which </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Cuba</span><span

which it is quite apparent that she is absolutely in our hands, and I believe

to specify the scope of the Platt Amendment, so as not to delay the military
installation of the Guantanamo Base, given what that would mean for the defense
of the Canal whose construction France had begun and later abandoned in the
Central American Isthmus, and which the voracious government of the empire
intended to complete at all costs. Nor was he interested in defining the legal
status of the </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Isle of Pines</span><span

The fall of the Gerardo Machado’s tyranny under the pressure of a powerful
popular movement, and the subsequent installation of a provisional government
headed by the university professor of physiology, Ramón Grau San Martin, were a
serious obstacle to the achievement of the program demanded by the people. </span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>, against Grau’s government. These included

style='font-size:14.0pt'> in which the Cuban people show their confidence would
be welcome”.  The impatience of the U.S, administration to get rid of Grau was
growing, as from mid-November the influence of a young anti-imperialist,
Antonio Guiteras, was increasing in the government, which would take many of
its more radical steps in the weeks to come.  It was necessary to swiftly
overthrow that government. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

government in January 1934, as a result of internal contradictions and a whole
series of pressures, maneuvers and aggressions wielded against it by
imperialism and its local allies, meant a first and indispensable step towards
the imposition of an oligarchic-imperialistic alternative to solve the Cuban
national crisis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

the </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Washington</span><span

feelings of the Cuban people towards neocolonialism and its instruments.  Nor
was the </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>United States</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'> unaware of the importance of the support

characterized, from a political point of view, by the adoption of measures that
allowed for elections for the Constitutional Assembly to be called and for them

was that it was in his interest to move towards the establishment of formulae
that would allow him to remain at the center of political decisions, and thus
ensure the continuity of his power within the new order arising under the
formulae that he had implemented.  At the beginning of 1938 the agreement

was entered into the national budget.  Since 1960 until today these cheques
have not been cashed and they are proof of the lease that has been imposed for
