<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Another argument for the Manifesto<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Why did I once claim, in one of my
reflections, that Bush had authorized or ordered my death?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>That phrase may appear ambiguous and
vague. Perhaps it would be more accurate, though even more confusing, to say
that he both authorized and ordered my death. Allow me to explain immediately:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The denunciation surrounding his
plan to assassinate me was made before he snatched an electoral victory from
his opponent through fraud. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As early as August 5, 2000, I
denounced these plans in Pinar del Rio, before a vast congregation of combative
citizens who had gathered there for the traditional July 26 festivities, held
in that province, in Villa Clara and Ciudad de <st1:PersonName
ProductID="La Habana" w:st="on">La Habana</st1:PersonName> in recognition of their
merits that year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Attempts to identify those
responsible for the hundreds of plans to assassinate me meet with a shroud of
secrecy. All direct and indirect means have been used to bring about my removal.
Following Nixon’s morally forced renunciation Ford forbade the participation of
government employees in assassination schemes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I am convinced that Carter, bound by
ethical convictions of a religious nature, would never have ordered any such
action against me. He was the only <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
president who had a gesture of friendship towards <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region>
in several important areas, including the establishment of the U.S. Interests
Section in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I don’t know that <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Clinton</st1:place></st1:City> ever ordered my death, so I cannot
accuse him of such an action. Unquestionably, he showed respect for the law and
acted with political savvy when he accepted the judicial decision that called
for the kidnapped child's return to his father and closest relatives, a
decision by then backed by the overwhelming majority of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>However, it is also a fact that,
during his administration, Posada Carriles hired Central American mercenaries
to place bombs in the hotels and recreational centers of cities like <st1:City
w:st="on">Havana</st1:City> and Varadero in order to strike at <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s economy,
hit by the blockade and the special period. The terrorist had no reservations
about declaring that the young Italian tourist who perished in one of the explosions
was “in the wrong place at the wrong time&quot;, a phrase Bush repeated
recently like the line from a poem. The money and even the electronic materials
used to assemble those bombs were provided by the Cuban American National
Foundation (CANF), which distributed the handsome sums at its disposal through shameless
lobbying with members of different parties at the U.S. Congress. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At the close of 1997, the 7th Latin
American Summit of Heads of State and Government, which I was obliged to
attend, was to be held on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Isla
  Margarita</st1:City>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Venezuela</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>On October 27 that year, a vessel
called “<st1:PersonName ProductID="La Esperanza" w:st="on">La Esperanza</st1:PersonName>”
was en route to Isla Margarita. While sailing very close to Puerto Rican coasts,
it was intercepted by a patrol boat of the Coast Guard and Customs Service of
that occupied island on suspicion of drug trafficking. On the vessel were four
Cuban-born terrorists carrying two 50-calibre Barrett semi-automatic assault
rifles with infrared-guided telescopic sights, capable of delivering precision
rounds to armor-plated vehicles and planes in mid-air or about to take off or
land from a distance of over a thousand meters, and 7 boxes of munitions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The semi-automatic rifles were the
property of Francisco José Hernández, Chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation. The yacht &quot;<st1:PersonName ProductID="La Esperanza" w:st="on">La
 Esperanza</st1:PersonName>” was the registered property of José Antonio
Llamas, one of the directors of that counterrevolutionary organization.
Recently, the latter declared that CANF had purchased a cargo helicopter, ten
ultra-light, remote-controlled planes, seven ships and abundant explosive
materials, with the express aim of executing terrorist actions against <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The
organization also had another yacht at its disposal, the &quot;Midnight
Express&quot;, which, according to Llamas, was to transport the Chairman —the
head of heads— Mas Canosa to the island, where he would declare himself President
after Fidel had been assassinated and his government overthrown. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>American officers in <st1:place
w:st="on">Puerto Rico</st1:place> had no choice but to turn the four crew
members over to the courts. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Venezuela</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Posada Carriles was to coordinate the execution of the plan. He was expected to
arrive there at any moment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Could <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> authorities, who generated and
provided the Foundation with public funds and million-dollar businesses, have
been unaware of these facts?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In December 1999, the detainees were
acquitted by an indulgent jury, for “lack of evidence”. The rigged proceedings
were manipulated by Héctor Pesquera, corrupt FBI officer who was later rewarded
with the directorship of FBI headquarters in <st1:City w:st="on">Miami</st1:City>
and was a key figure in the arrest of the five Cuban anti-terrorist activists
in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Florida</st1:place></st1:State>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The notorious Cuban-American mafia was
preparing for the November 2000 presidential elections. Both parties were
contending for its support, for the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Florida</st1:place></st1:State>
state could tilt the balance. The chieftains, of pure Batista stock, were the
experts in committing fraud. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In the address I mentioned above, I literally
said, among other things:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The so-called Republican Convention has just come to an end. It was
held in none other than the city of <st1:City w:st="on">Philadelphia</st1:City>,
home to the famous 1776 Declaration of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>.
Actually, (…) those slaveholders who rebelled against the British colonial rule
did not abolish the disgraceful practice of slavery --which remained in effect
for almost a whole century longer (…).<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:Arial'>“(…) the first announcement made at the
Republican Convention just held in Philadelphia under the leadership of the
party’s illustrious candidate, [in violation of major international
agreements], was the plan to considerably raise the military budget for
research and development, and the construction of an antimissile shield to
cover the entire nation with a radar network that could detect enemy missiles
en route to U.S. territory and shoot them down in mid-air.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:Arial'>“Those holding these views are unable
to understand that such a policy would meet with the overwhelming opposition of
the rest of the world, including <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>. That,
like a magnet, it would bring together all those nations threatened by a
strategy that would leave them helpless against the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. A new, dangerous and
extremely costly arms race would immediately follow and nothing could prevent
the proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction&quot;. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>I
dared predict these events seven years before Bush’s recent visit to the
Albanian capital, which was the subject of one of my reflections. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>I
continued my address as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:Arial'>“The authors of the plan know very well
that slightly more than half the American people, who are still confused and
insufficiently informed about this complex issue, believe that to be the most
suitable solution in the interest of the country’s peace and security. However,
the adoption of this extreme position by the Republican candidate vis à vis any
other more sensible or reasonable proposal from his opponent would present him
to voters as the strong, farsighted, tough guy that the United States needs to
confront all imaginary or real dangers. This is the good news they sent out
from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Philadelphia</st1:place></st1:City>
to all of the peoples on Earth”.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>This
was still well before witnessing the occupation of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Afghanistan</st1:country-region>
and the plans to unleash a war against <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>I
proceeded to denounce Bush’s program vis-à-vis <st1:place w:st="on">Latin
 America</st1:place>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:Arial'>“What does this smart platform have to
offer Latin America and the <st1:place w:st="on">Caribbean</st1:place> in
particular? There is a phrase that says it all: &quot;The next American century
should include all of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Americas</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&quot;
This simple statement means no less than the proclamation of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>’ right of ownership over Latin
America and the <st1:place w:st="on">Caribbean</st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:Arial'>“It later adds: ‘In concert with the
Congress, (the president) will work with key democracies (…) and --above all-- <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Mexico</st1:country-region></st1:place>.’
(…). Particularly striking is the phrase that reads: ‘...and --above all—<st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>’ since
that is a country they robbed of half its territory through an unjustifiable,
expansionist war. Their obvious intent is to begin with the economic annexation
and full political subordination of that country to the United States and then
do likewise with the rest of the countries in our region, imposing a free trade
agreement essentially favorable to U.S. interests, from which not even the
tiniest Caribbean island could escape. They mean, of course, the free
circulation of capital and commodities, not the people! <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:Arial'>“As expected, the highly biased
Philadelphia platform devotes a substantial part of its section on Latin
America to Cuba: ‘Our economic and political relations will change when the
Cuban regime frees all political prisoners, legalizes peaceful protest, allows
opposition political activity, permits free expression, and commits to
democratic elections.’ For the authors of this demagogic abomination, freedom
and democracy mean an outdated, corrupt system in which it is money alone that
decides and elects, and in which a presidential candidate is nominated, with
lightning speed, as the heir to a vacant throne”.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:Arial'>“Another wire story reports that: ‘The
platform, aside from active support for the enemies of the Revolution, includes
the broadcasting of news from the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
to the <st1:place w:st="on">Caribbean</st1:place> nation.’ That is, they intend
to keep up with the filth spewed against <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region>
by subversive radio stations located in <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
territory; they will persist in the outrageous use of the name of José Martí
--a name that is glorious and sacred to our people-- in official <st1:country-region

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>”.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

legislators of Cuban descent euphorically squealed]: ‘This is unprecedented
language. Never before has the Republican Party made such a broad commitment’”.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

garbage contained in the Republican platform, it is finally stated: ‘Republicans
believe that the United States should adhere to the principles established by
the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, which recognizes the rights of Cuban refugees
fleeing communist tyranny’”. </span></i><span style='font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

will so crumble that not even its dust will remain. We will systematically
denounce and demolish one by one, its hypocrisy and lies. They obviously have
absolutely no idea what kinds of people have been forged in these 40 years of
Revolution. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

corners of the Earth, and our struggle will serve as an example. The world,
ever more ungovernable, will fight until hegemony and the subjugation of

<p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

empire should not ignore that Cuba demands the total removal of the murderous
Cuban Adjustment Act and the criminal pieces of legislation that bear the
notorious names of Torricelli and Helms-Burton as well as the genocidal
blockade and economic war. It should be noted that those who have authored,
promoted and enforced these laws and policies are guilty of the crime of

vulgar deceit. Once demagoguery and lies are definitely exposed and defeated,
the world will find excellent allies in the American people. This is what
happened in the case of the repugnant war that cost the lives of millions of
Vietnamese and over 50,000 young Americans. A more recent example is the
American people noble support of a little boy and a Cuban family, victims of a
brutal crime perpetrated by a band of criminals who, after having taken

suggest that you leave aside the euphoria and fever of your Convention, and
reconsider your position in order to avoid the risk of becoming the tenth

I do not share this narrow view of the role of individuals in history, I urge
you not to forget that for every one of the revolutionary leaders you may
decide to so remove, there are millions of men and women in Cuba who are
