style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I cannot
speak as an economist or a scientist. I simply speak as a politician who wishes
to unravel the economists’ and scientists’ arguments one way or another. I also
try to sense the motivations of each one of those who make statements on these
matters. Just twenty-two years ago, here in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Havana</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, we had a great number of meetings with
political, union, peasant and student leaders invited to our country as representatives
of these sectors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They all agreed that
the most important problem at that time was the enormous foreign debt
accumulated by the nations of </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
 style='font-family:Arial'>Latin America</span></st1:place><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'> in 1985. That debt amounted to 350 billion
dollars.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dollar then had a higher purchasing
power than it does today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>A copy of the outcome of those meetings was
sent to all the world governments, of course with some exceptions, because it might
have seemed insulting. At that time, the petrodollars had flooded the market
and the large transnational banks were virtually demanding that the countries
accept high loans. Needless to say, the people responsible for the economy had
taken on those commitments without consulting anybody. That period coincided
with the presence of the most repressive and bloody governments this continent
has ever suffered, installed by imperialism. Large sums were spent on weapons,
luxuries and consumer goods. The subsequent debt grew to 800 billion dollars
while today’s catastrophic dangers were being hatched, the dangers that weigh upon
a population that doubled in just two decades and along with it, the number of
those condemned to a life of extreme poverty. Today, in the Latin American
region, the difference between the most favored population and the one with the
lowest income is the greatest in the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Many years before the subjects of today’s
debates were center stage, the struggles of the </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Third World</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> focused on equally agonizing problems like
the unequal exchange. Year after year it was discovered that the price of the industrialized
nations’ exports, usually manufactured with our raw materials, would
unilaterally grow while our basic exports remained unchanged. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The price of coffee and cacao, just to mention
two examples, was approximately 2,000 dollars a ton.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A cup of coffee or a chocolate milkshake
could be bought in cities like </span><st1:State><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> for a few cents; today, these cost
several dollars, perhaps 30 or 40 times what they cost back then. Today, the
purchase of a tractor, a truck or medical equipment require several times the volume
of products that was needed to import them back then; jute, henequen and other
Third World produced fibers that were substituted by synthetic ones succumbed
to the same fate. In the meantime, tanned hides, rubber and natural fibers used
in many textiles were being replaced by synthetic materials derived from the
sophisticated petrochemical industry while sugar prices hit rock bottom,
crushed by the large subsidies granted by the industrialized countries to their
agricultural sector.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The former colonies or neocolonies that
had been promised a glowing future after World War II had not yet awakened from
the Bretton Woods dream.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From top to
bottom, the system had been designed for exploitation and plundering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>When consciousness was beginning to be
roused, the other extremely adverse factors had not yet surfaced, such as the
undreamed-of squandering of energy that industrialized countries had fallen
prey to. They were paying less than two dollars a barrel of oil. The source of
fuel, with the exception of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> where it was very abundant, was basically
in </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Third World</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> countries, chiefly in the </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Middle East</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> but also in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Mexico</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Venezuela</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, and later in </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Africa</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>. But not all of the countries that by
virtue of yet another white lie classified as “developing countries” were oil producers,
since 82 of them are among the poorest and as a rule they must import oil. A
terrible situation awaits them if food stuffs are to be transformed into
biofuels or agrifuels, as the peasant and native movements in our region prefer
to call them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Thirty years ago, the idea of global
warming hanging over our species’ life like a sword of Damocles was not even
known by the immense majority of the inhabitants of our planet; even today
there is great ignorance and confusion about these issues. If we listen to the
spokesmen of the transnationals and their media, we are living in the best of
all possible worlds: an economy ruled by the market, plus transnational
capital, plus sophisticated technology equals a constant growth of productivity,
higher GDP, higher living standards and every dream of the human species come
true; the state should not interfere with anything, it should not even exist,
other than as an instrument of the large financial capital.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>But reality is hard-headed. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Germany</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, one of the most highly industrialized
countries in the world, loses sleep over its 10 percent unemployment. The
toughest and least attractive jobs are taken by immigrants who, desperate in
their growing poverty, break into industrialized </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Europe</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> through any possible chink. Apparently,
nobody is taking note of the number of inhabitants on our planet, growing
precisely in the undeveloped countries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>More than 700 representatives of social
organizations have just been meeting in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Havana</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> to discuss various issues raised in this
reflection. Many of them set out their points of view and left indelible
impressions on us. There is plenty of material to reflect upon as well as new
events happening every day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Even now, as a consequence of liberating a
terrorist monster, two young men, who were fulfilling their legal duty in the Active
Military Service, anxious to taste consumerism in the United States, hijacked a
bus, crashed through one of the doors of the domestic flights terminal at the
airport, drove up to a civilian aircraft and got on board with their hostages,
demanding to be taken to the United States. A few days earlier, they had killed
a soldier, who was standing guard, to steal two automatic weapons, and in the
plane they fired four shots that killed a brave officer who, unarmed and held
hostage in the bus, had attempted to prevent the plane’s hijacking.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The impunity and the material gains that have
rewarded any violent action against </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> during the last half-century encourage
such events.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It had been many months
since we had such an incident. All it needed was setting a notorious terrorist
free and once again death come calling at our door. The perpetrators have not
gone on trial yet because, in the course of events, both were wounded; one of
them was shot by the other as he fired inside the plane, while they were
struggling with the heroic army officer. Now, many people abroad are waiting
for the reaction of our Courts and of the Council of State, while our people here
are deeply outraged with these events. We really need a large dose of calmness
and sangfroid to confront these problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The apocalyptic head of the empire
declared more than five years ago that the United States armed forces had to be
on the ready to make pre-emptive attacks on 60 or more countries in the world;
nothing less than one third of the international community. Apparently, he is
not satisfied with the death, the torture and the uprooting of millions of people
to seize their natural resources and the product of their labors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Meanwhile, the impressive international
meeting that just concluded in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Havana</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> reaffirmed my personal conviction: every
evil idea must be submitted to devastating criticism, avoiding any concession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
