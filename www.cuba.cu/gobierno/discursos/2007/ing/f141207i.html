begun when he rather abruptly placed a short list of names on the table, a list
that he had obviously received shortly before. I could almost guess what it
was. This was what usually happened whenever we were visited by a political
figure from a <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
ally or an American politician: the State Department would hand them a list of
people tried in a court of law or sentenced for counterrevolutionary
activities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

greatest importance or interest to the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> intelligence services or
government always headed up the lists. They would ask for the individuals on
the list to be pardoned or released. It was a tactic consistently used by the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region> government to apply pressure in favor of
its friends, taking advantage of any friendly visit to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Because
our country normally exercises the greatest tolerance possible, it is only in
exceptional cases that the authorities proceed to arrest and prosecute those
involved, when their acts of provocation are grave or totally unacceptable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

minister reminded me that, as a result of the Pope’s visit, a number of
individuals sentenced for their counterrevolutionary activities had been
pardoned, and he said he had pledged to request the same for those on the list.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt;line-height:

response, he immediately proposed that <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region>
sign the United Nations Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, since
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had done just as much or more than any other country in the world in this

went on to mention the North American Free Trade Agreement among Canada, Mexico

the treaty against anti-personal landmines, lamenting that <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region> had not
yet signed it, and requesting that it do so. These were the four points with
which he opened the talks. They all seemed very simple. All four, however, were
extremely complex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt;line-height:

common for Canadian politicians to begin by the most difficult questions, and
jokingly added that we might be spoiling the visit if we did not do well on

that the meeting lasted around two hours and that it unfolded in an atmosphere

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt;line-height:

not decide anything personally and immediately, or commit myself on any of the
issues, or raise false expectations concerning the decisions we would adopt. I
said that the highly publicized matter of alleged prisoners of conscience was
an old story after almost 40 years of all kinds of misdeeds and crimes
committed against <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region> by
the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
I listed them in depth and in detail, contrasting them with the irreproachable
conduct and ethics of our Revolution despite the deluge of slander and lies
heaped on <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
I spoke of the hypocrisy and double standards reflected in the United States’
policy towards Cuba, and the circumstances that had obliged us to have people
in prison; at the Bay of Pigs alone, we had taken 1200 invaders prisoner. I
explained that the Revolution itself, from the very first years, had been
releasing those who had tried to destroy it serving the interests of a foreign
power over the course of four decades. I noted that the issue of those who were
currently in prison for this reason was constantly used to pressure <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>, a country
suffering hostility and aggression from abroad. I described the serious threats
we still faced, such as the acts of terrorism organized and financed by the <st1:country-region

for this situation to be overcome, in order for us to return to the big family.
I told him that we were Latin Americans, and I asked him if it was a matter of
us returning to the big family, or of the big family returning to us. I
concluded on this point by telling him that he had brought a list of
individuals who were mercenaries in the service of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> and paid by the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>, who were trying to destroy the
Revolution in complicity with the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. I said that I had to
tell him as a friend that such a list was humiliating for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He took
pains to explain that this was not his intent, and said that perhaps he had
presented the list much too soon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

second point, the United Nations Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, I did not hesitate to point out that we could sign all of the articles
except two, articles 8 and 13. The first, I said, may be well and good for
capitalist countries like <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>,
the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and the countries of Latin American, since some are ruled by businesses and
oligarchies, and the others by the big transnationals. In countries like those,
workers are divided, fractured and, when possible, corrupted and alienated, and
can accomplish very little in the face of the political power of their bosses.
It is a question of economic systems different from ours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>This article of the
Covenant refers to the right of everyone to form trade unions and join the
trade union of his choice, subject only to the rules of the organization
concerned, for the promotion and protection of their economic and social
interests. Now, in a socialist country like Cuba, where manual and intellectual
workers are all organized in their respective trade unions and solidly united
as a revolutionary class that shares power with the rest of the people, with
the peasants, women, students, neighborhood residents and citizens in general,
such a precept could serve as a weapon and a pretext for imperialism to try to
divide and fracture the workers, create artificial unions, and decrease their
political and social power and influence. In the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United
 States</st1:country-region> and many countries in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>
and other parts of the world, the strategy used by imperialism is to divide,
weaken and corrupt the trade union movement to the point where it is completely
defenseless against the bosses. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>, it would be used
fundamentally for subversive and destabilizing purposes, to undermine the
political power and diminish the extraordinary strength and influence of our
workers, and to erode the heroic resistance of the only socialist state in the
West in the face of the hegemonic superpower.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The other article
could not be signed either, because it would open the doors to the
privatization of education. In the past, that gave rise to painful differences
and intolerable privileges and injustices, including racial discrimination,
something our children will never again have to face. A country that managed to
eradicate illiteracy in just one year, that has achieved an average educational
level of ninth grade, and that has an extraordinary and massive contingent of
professors and teachers and the most sound and successful educational system in
the world does not need to commit itself to such a precept. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

we sign the Covenant and state our reservation with regard to the two articles
in question. We responded that afterwards there would be talk of non-compliance
with the Covenant, and nobody would know about or remember the reservations
with which it was signed. You cannot play around with these things!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Treaty on landmines, we did not spend much time on the subject during that
meeting. I told him that we were not going to sign it. I explained that we had
an <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
military base right in our own territory, and that the only landmines in our
country were between the limits of that base and the rest of our territory. For
us, I said, landmines were a defensive weapon, and we would not make the
mistake of giving them up; we do not have nuclear weapons, intelligent bombs
and missiles, and the other highly sophisticated weapons that the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has. A genuine threat hangs over our country, and this is why we do not intend

subject once again, from an angle that I never would have suspected at the
time. At the end of this first meeting he told me, with obvious satisfaction
and sincerity, that it had been an excellent discussion. This summary of the
main points addressed at our first meeting might give the impression that it
took place in a gruff atmosphere, but nothing could be further from the truth.
The atmosphere was warm and friendly at all times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It seemed clear to me
–although he did not state it like that but I picked it up from the whole of
what Mr. Chrétien said– that in the presence of such a powerful neighbor, with
which it shares an 8,644 kilometer-long border, he feared for the future of his
country. Being aware of their strong and deeply rooted --but also different--
cultures and traditions he is concerned about the risk posed to his country’s
unity by any ambitions, errors or upheavals on the part of its neighbor. For
this enormous and rich territory, with a population of hardly 32 million, whose
natural resources include –as Chrétien himself indicated– one quarter of the
world’s drinking water reserves, the United States constitutes a major
headache, perhaps even more so than it does for Cuba.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the most interesting point of the conversation, when Chrétien stated his most
intelligent idea, capable of inspiring a sense of solidarity even in a listener
with a considerably different ideology, he said that he had been opposed to the
idea of a Free Trade Agreement with the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> alone. At least a
third party had to be found, and that third party ended up being Mexico, with
which Canada often shares stances vis à vis the United States’ maneuvers. He
also said that in the year 2005 there would be 34, and hopefully 35 (an obvious
reference to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>),
to balance the United States power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>At one point he told
me that Canada was extremely sensitive about its independence with regard to the
United States, that it was very important for it to preserve its independence
from the United States, and that its policy was to sustain close and friendly
but very independent relations with that country. He proudly informed me that <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region> was now competing with the Silicon Valley
in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:State>,

with Chrétien and his delegation took place at night. There was a dinner, and a
broader exchange. At a certain point, when the subject arose of the plot to
assassinate me on Margarita Island, a plot organized by the infamous
Cuban-American National Foundation, he commented that this was often the cause
of major difficulties; the incident with the aircraft, he said, was aimed at
creating a problem when the U.S. government was ready to take a positive step
in relation to Cuba. I then described to him about the Cuban Adjustment Act,
and its absurd and irrational consequences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt;line-height:

Helms-Burton Act. He told me that the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> is totally isolated
with regard to this legislation. He said that he personally was the first to
issue a statement after it was passed. He was meeting with the Prime ministers
of the <st1:place w:st="on">Caribbean</st1:place> at the time, and together
they issued the first declaration against the Helms-Burton Act. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with the aircraft in 1996, used as justification for the signing of the
Helms-Burton Act, I told him that he could find an almost complete account of
the incident in the January 26, 1998 edition of The New Yorker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would be not only for our countries, but also for the rest of the world, as
well as the tricks that would be used to impose a Multilateral Agreement on
Investments. I also said that these issues are a source of deep concern to us
and they should be thoroughly studied. I talked to him about concrete aspects
of our economy, and the measures adopted to cope with the special period. I
pointed out that it would be impossible for many countries in Latin America and
the <st1:place w:st="on">Caribbean</st1:place> to do without tariffs, because
some of them obtain up to 80% of their budgetary revenues this way. When I asked
him if <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region> was harmed in
any way by European integration and the creation of the Euro currency, he said
that it was not because 82% of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>’s
trade is with the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> amounting to 1 billion per day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

propitious atmosphere, and mindful of Canada’s involvement in the political
events in Haiti, currently in a process of normalization, and Canada’s presence
in that country, I pointed out that Haiti was a close neighbor and one of the
poorest countries in the world, with terrible health indicators, including the
prevalence of AIDS, which threatened to become a human catastrophe. I said that
together we could set an example of cooperation by working out a joint health
care program for <st1:country-region w:st="on">Haiti</st1:country-region> where
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region> would send the medical

and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mozambique</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to remove anti-personal landmines. You can contribute the workers, we will
contribute the money, he said. The other countries had already signed the
agreement, he added. We indicated that the only people who could do this work
were members of the armed forces. He responded that we Cubans had expert
personnel and that they, the Canadians, would supply the money for the project,
since the budget for it had already been approved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<st1:country-region w:st="on">Norway</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region

mutilation and death of our soldiers. Perhaps he never viewed it this way, or

carefully observed the Canadian prime minister’s character and personality. He
is a pleasant conversationalist and has a good sense of humor, and one can
strike up an interesting exchange with him on various subjects. He is concerned
about certain problems in the world today, and shows great enthusiasm for his
favorite projects. He is acquainted with many political figures, knows how to
make use of his experience, and enjoys telling stories that are generally
timely and interesting. He appeared to be sincerely patriotic. He is loyal to
his country and proud of it. He is a fanatical believer in the capitalist mode
of production, as if it were a monotheistic religion, and in the naive idea
that it is the only solution for all of the world’s countries, on every
continent, in every era, in every clime or region. He was educated in this

would be meeting with <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Clinton</st1:place></st1:City>

Chrétien, explaining that this was not my message. It was an awkward situation.
It was not easy to reconcile my annoyance with the precise terms needed to
write this letter, and in a certain way my clarification became, at the same
time, a kind of criticism of our friend. I almost managed it, but I finally
gave up the idea, and even put away the draft of the letter, which might still
be found in some old notebook; I had forgotten all about the matter until

years we are used to such treatment– but rather the fact that the 300,000

they were U.S. dollars or Canadian dollar, worth 64 cents of a U.S. dollar
according to the exchange rate yesterday, April 24, 2001, since I have not had
time to find out what it was worth on March 15 of that year. To me it was
inconceivable that they would punish us at the cost of the lives of perhaps
thousands of Haitian children, lives that could have been saved because at that
point there were at least 25,000 children dying in Haiti every year, and the
majority of those deaths could have been prevented with simple vaccines that
could have been bought with those dollars, whether U.S. or Canadian.
