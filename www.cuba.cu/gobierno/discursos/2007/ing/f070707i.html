style='font-family:Arial'>The founding fathers of the American nation could not
imagine that what they were proclaiming at that time, as any other historical
society, was carrying within it the seeds of its own transformation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The
attractive Declaration of Independence of 1776, which celebrated its 231<sup>st</sup>
birthday last Wednesday, stated something which in one way or another
captivated many of us:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“We hold these
truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal; that they are
endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That whenever any Form of Government becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter it or abolish
it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles
and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to
effect their Safety and Happiness.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>It was the
result of the influence of the best minds and philosophers of a </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Europe</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> overwhelmed by feudalism, the privileges
of the aristocracy and absolute monarchies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    
</span>Jean-Jacques Rousseau stated in his famous Social Contract: “The
strongest is never strong enough to be always the master, unless he transforms
strength into right, and obedience into duty.” (…) “Force is a physical power,
and I fail to see what moral effect it can have.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To yield to force is an act of necessity, not
of will…” (…)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“To renounce liberty is to
renounce being a man, to surrender the rights of Humanity and even its
duties.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For him who renounces everything
no indemnity is possible.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In the
Thirteen Colonies that obtained their independence, there were also forms of
slavery as atrocious as those in ancient times.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Men and women were sold at public auction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The new nation emerged with its own religion
and culture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Tea Tax was the spark
that set off the rebellion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In those
vast lands slavery continued for at least 100 years, and after two centuries,
slave descendants are still feeling the consequences.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were native communities which were the
legitimate natural inhabitants, as well as forests, water, lakes, herds of
millions of bison, natural species of animals and plants, abundant and various
foods.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hydrocarbons were unknown then,
as was the enormous wasting of energy carried out by today’s society.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The
Philadelphia Declaration was written at a time when there were only small printing
presses and letters took years to get from one country to another.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were only a few people who could read
and write.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today, images, words and
ideas travel in a fraction of a second from one corner to another in a
globalized planet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Conditioned reflexes
are created in the minds of people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
cannot speak about the right to use, but rather about the overuse of free
expression and mass alienation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Likewise, with modest electronic equipment, anybody, during peacetime,
can send their ideas out into the world without any authorization from any
Constitution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would be a battle of
ideas; in any case, a mass of truths versus a mass of lies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Truths do
not need commercial advertisements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Nobody could disagree with the Philadelphia Declaration or with
Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Social Contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Both documents support the right to struggle against the established
world tyranny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Could we
ignore the pillaging wars and the slaughters which are forced upon the poor
peoples who make up three-quarters of the planet?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Those are typical of today’s world and of a system that could not
sustain itself otherwise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At an enormous
political, economic and scientific cost, the human species is being pushed to
the edge of an abyss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>My aim is
not to repeat concepts that I have mentioned in other reflections.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Based on simple events, my purpose is to
carry on demonstrating the immense hypocrisy and the total lack of ethics which
characterize the actions, chaotic by nature, of the government of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In
&quot;The Killing Machine”, published last Sunday, I said that it was through
one of the declassified CIA documents that we found out about the attempt to
poison me using an official of the Cuban government with access to my
office.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It dealt with a person about
whom I should have sought out some information, since I didn't have the
elements on hand to make the necessary judgement.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, I offered my apologies if I was
hurting the feelings of any descendants, whether or not the concerned person
were guilty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I later continued to
analyze other important subjects in the CIA revelations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

</span>During the early days of the Revolution, I used to visit, almost on a
daily basis, the recently created National Institute of Agrarian Reform, located
where today we have the headquarters of the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were not able to use the
Palace of the Revolution yet, since that was the venue of the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its construction resulted from juicy business
deals made by the overthrown regime.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
main profit came from the increased value of real estate lands, from which
thousands of people had been evicted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As
a recently graduated lawyer, I worked <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pro

Batista’s coup d'état.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

</span>What came to my mind immediately was the thought of a ship loaded with

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, a country far from being suspected of
being Communist.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Right away I went down
to go to that location.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On my way there,
because of the noise and the vehicle’s vibrations, I could not hear the second
explosion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>More than 100 people died and
dozens were maimed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the funeral for
the victims, the cry of “Homeland or Death” (Patria o Muerte) was spontaneously
born.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>We know that

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
