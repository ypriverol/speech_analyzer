  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Havana</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> following the revolutionary triumph, many
memories of fallen, heroic comrades came to me. I thought of Juan Manuel
Márquez, a brilliant orator and follower of Marti's ideas and second chief of
the Granma expeditionary force. I thought of Abel Santamaría, who was to take
command of our forces were I to fall during the attack on the Moncada garrison;
of Pedro Marrero, Ñico López, José Luis Tasende, Gildo Fleitas, the Gómez
brothers, Ciro Redondo, Julio Díaz and practically all the members of the
numerous contingent of young people from Artemisa who fell at Moncada or in the
Sierra. The list is endless. All of them came from the rank and file of the
Orthodox Party. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
first problem we faced was getting Batista out of office. Had Chibás been
alive, Batista would not have been able to stage his coup d'état, because the
founder of the Cuban (Orthodox) People's Party kept a close eye on him and
called him into question publicly and methodically. Following Chibás’ death,
Batista was sure to lose the elections scheduled for </span><st1:date Month="6"
Day="1" Year="1952"><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>June 1, 1952</span></st1:date><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, two and a half months after the coup.
Opinion polls were fairly reliable and Batista's unpopularity was constantly
growing, day after day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
was at the meeting where the new Orthodox candidate was chosen. I was more of a
bold intruder than an invitee. I was to enter parliament, to struggle in the
name of a radical program. No one could have prevented this. Then, it was
rumored that I was a communist, a word which prompted many negative reactions
inculcated by the dominant classes. To have spoken of Marxism-Leninism then, or
even during the first years of the Revolution, would have been foolish and
clumsy. During the speech I delivered before Chibás' grave, I spoke such that
the people would understand the objective contradictions which our society faced
at the time and which we still must face. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
spoke every day at a local radio station in the capital to deliver messages
directly to tens of thousands of voters who had spontaneously joined the
Orthodox Party. I also addressed the entire nation through the special
supplements of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Alerta </i>newspaper
on several, nearly consecutive Mondays, publishing the proven accusations of
corruption in the Prío government voiced between January 28 and </span><st1:date
Month="3" Day="4" Year="1952"><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>March
 4, 1952</span></st1:date><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>.
Intuitively, I was able to predict and get inside Batista's intentions of
staging a coup. I denounced these intentions before the party leadership and
asked them permission to use Chibás' Sunday radio time to do so publicly.
&quot;We'll look into it&quot;, they told me. Two days later, they announced
the following: &quot;We have looked into the matter through our channels and
there's no indication of that whatsoever&quot;. The coup could have been
prevented but nothing was done. Months before, Chibás had already,
painstakingly managed to prevent &quot;a pact without ideology&quot;, as he
would call it, between members of the Orthodox party and the former Cuban
(Authentic) Revolutionary Party. Most of the provincial party leadership had
supported the pact. The economic system prevailing at the time made it easy for
the oligarchy and land-owners to take control of the party leadership in nearly
all of the country's provinces. Only one party leadership remained loyal, the
one in the capital, which was heavily influenced by radical intellectuals.
Following the coup and at a time when unity was most dearly needed, what the
oligarchy did was abandon the vast majority of the people at the mercy of the
imperialist tempest. I continued to adhere to my revolutionary project, only that
this time it would be an armed struggle, from the very beginning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
day in which Chibás --whose body lay in state at the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span

  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Havana--</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> was to be buried, I proposed that the
leadership of the Orthodox Party lead the enormous funeral procession to the
Presidential Palace and seize the premises. I had spent the entire night
answering questions from radio reporters and inciting the people to undertake
radical actions. No one at the university paid any attention to the radio
broadcasts that night. We had a disorganized, panic-stricken government, a
demoralized army that had no intention of repressing that procession. No one
would have held it back. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One
year after the death of Chibás, I wrote a proclamation titled “A Harsh Blow”,
which was mimeographed six days following Batista’s treacherous coup. What
follows is the text of this proclamation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

as the result was not changed by a flood of funds from the Public Treasury in
favor of the candidate imposed by Batista in 1944.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

Constitution to shreds when we were only two months away from reaching the goal
through the official channels. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

clandestine newspaper <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>El acusador </i>published
an article entitled “A Critical Assessment of the Cuban (Orthodox) People’s
Party”, under the pseudonym of &quot;Alejandro&quot;. As I have already offered
a critical assessment of that party, I thought it apt to include the following
analysis: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and beyond the commotion of the cowards, the mediocre and the fainthearted, it

death of Chibás, those colossal scandals, for reasons that were not exactly
ideological but purely selfish and personal, still echo like bitter blows of
