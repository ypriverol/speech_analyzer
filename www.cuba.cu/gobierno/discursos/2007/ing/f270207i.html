<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:

you spoke of 20 million hectares, something like that (Laughter), but refresh

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>Fidel Castro<span class=GramE>.-</span> Yes, 20 million. And, of course,
the idea of using food products to produce fuel is tragic, startling. No one
has any certainty about how high food prices are going to get when soy begins
to be converted into fuel, when there is such a high demand of it around the
world to produce eggs, to produce milk, to produce meat. This is one more
tragedy among many today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:

have taken up the flag to save our species, because we have to work hard to
save the species, because there are new, very pressing problems and you are
acting as a teacher, a great teacher, really. You have become a defender of the
cause, a defender of the survival of the species, and I congratulate you for
this. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:

</i>program, to educate people, to help them understand these issues. And there
is no shortage of information on these issues, every day I read and go over and
keep very much abreast of things: risks of war, climatic risks, food-related
risks, because —as you mentioned—it is a fact that thousands of millions of
people are starving. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:

it is a project to be carried out over two or three years. It makes you laugh,
because, in two months, you have already installed 34 million light bulbs and,
in four months’ time, you will have reached the goal of taking those light bulbs,
which have many advantages, to all homes. So, there’s another contender out
there, but some of us are already competing with </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We were talking about
you just now, because, as you know, today is the 27<sup>th</sup> of February,
and here, some 18 years ago, we were told that one of the causes of the <span
class=SpellE>Caracazo</span> was that you, when you came back then, had left
200 agitators behind who made all hell break lose, as people say. And today we
were analyzing the causes behind the foreign debt, Black <span class=GramE>Friday,</span>
the way the country was bled dry, capital flight, privatizations, inflation and
the terrible recession, unemployment, the collapse of the middle class, even. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Well, we were reading
Einstein a moment ago, I don’t know if you were listening, and Einstein
reflects upon the reason behind socialism and concludes that what capitalism
creates is chaos. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So, looking back on the
<span class=SpellE>Caracazo</span>, Fidel, we were remembering you and I was
invoking those days, when I saw you from afar, here, and wanted to go up to you
and greet you, but couldn’t. But we were already involved in a revolutionary
movement here. And I want to tell our listeners here, on <span class=SpellE>Aló</span>
<span class=SpellE>Presidente</span>, who are listening to you and talking to
you, what a great honour it is for me that, on that day, a people rose up
against neo-liberalism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The <span class=SpellE>Caracazo</span>,
as you know, Fidel, was the world’s first response, an enormously powerful
response, to the <span class=SpellE>neoliberal</span> plan, at a time when the </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> and Berlin Wall
were falling and there was already talk that the end of history and the
single-idea system had arrived. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And the 4<sup>th</sup>
of February was the result of the <span class=SpellE>Caracazo</span>. You know
that you couldn’t understand one without the other. Then came this path, this
revolution of ours, for which Cuba is always, has been and will always be a
beacon, Cuba, with you at its vanguard. There are so many things to be grateful
for, especially this energy revolution which, without </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

been impossible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We will continue
working with you. Today, a session of the 7<sup>th</sup> High Level Joint

  style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Havana</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>, as you know, and
the results I have been informed of till now, regarding what progress has been

  lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Americas</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> and the state of
bilateral relations, are extraordinary indeed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I should inform you,
you’ve probably been informed of this, I should tell you, so that everyone
knows, that, yesterday, I authorized Minister Rafael <span class=SpellE>Ramírez</span>
to establish a joint venture with Vietnam, and I asked him to mention this
project there in Havana, because the three of us, Cuba, Vietnam, Venezuela,
could open a joint company based here in Venezuela, or in Cuba, or in the two
countries, a light-bulb factory with which we could continue to expand the
revolution. Energy-saving light-bulbs and other articles needed to take the
energy revolution further, solar panels, wind-power systems. I want to set up
those factories here, Fidel, to bring over the technology. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>What do you think about
this?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>Fidel Castro.- I think these are marvellous ideas. About three days ago,
we began to operate a wind power farm in <span class=SpellE>Isla</span> de la <span
class=SpellE>Juventud</span>. Though still relatively small, equipped with
275-kilowatt wind-power generators, it serves as a pilot project for what we
are planning to do there</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>. There is an area with great potential in the
country’s eastern region, where we are taking all of the measurements needed to
set up other wind power parks which will produce electricity at lower
investment costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>You have an advantage
over us: your country isn’t lashed by hurricanes. Hurricanes are constantly
passing through </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'> and we have to
take different types of measures to protect the generators. Sometimes, we have
to use cranes, sometimes we have to remove the blades, find some kind of
solution. There’s the solar energy alternative. In </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

facilities that use reliable technologies and you have made good use of them.
Though the initial investment is considerable, later, if you manufacture the
