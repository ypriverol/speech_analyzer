<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><st1:country-region

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Arial'>’S
SELF-CRITICISM<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><span style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The National Directorate of the UJC (Communist
Youth League) agreed to communicate the following measure as it was concluding
its strategy:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Last Saturday, July 7,
the National Bureau of the Communist Youth decided to tighten up the plan for
the mobilization of forces of the Student Work Brigades (BET), guided by the
principle of using students for tasks of a social and recreational nature, in
numbers adjusted to a necessary minimum and within municipalities where they
reside, in order to avoid relying on transportation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“That decision was discussed on the same
day with the National General Staff of the BET, made up of student
organizations and bodies belonging to the Central State Administration, and
also with the directorates of the Communist Youth in all the provinces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“The idea of making a more rational use of
the mobilized forces was emphasized; also, saving material resources,
especially fuel, and the fact that the students should be using their time consolidating
their knowledge, incorporating reading habits and discussing subjects of great
importance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“As a result of the decisions adopted,
only 200,000 of the originally planned 600,000 students will be mobilized in
July and August.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mobilizations to the
agricultural fields or schools in the countryside will not take place, since
their locations imply the use of transportation and other logistical services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“This year the call will be made for only
7 days of work related to the tasks included in the Energy Revolution, together
with the social workers, such as training the community to improve their energy
saving habits, delivering the domestic appliances that have not been distributed,
and visiting a number of families who, having received and taken on the
pertinent obligations, have yet to complete their payments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“They will also be participating in the
Anti-Mosquito Campaign in order to prevent a return of dengue fever, and in
primary and secondary health care, supporting polyclinics and hospitals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“Promoting cultural, recreational and
sports activities in the communities will be another of the tasks occupying the
members of the Student Work Brigades.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“The UJC will promote study and discussion
among the mobilized young people and among the rest of the youth.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I can certainly congratulate the National
Directorate of the Communist Youth League, and also the people in charge of the
Organization and Ideology Departments of the Party who were consulted about
this and who wholeheartedly supported this measure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Physical labor on its own does not
generate conscience.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every worker is
different.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their temperament, their
physique, their spirit, the kind of work they do, the toughness of their work,
the conditions under which they labor –under a scorching sun or in an
air-conditioned room-, whether it is piecework or is salaried, whether the
worker is disciplined or not, whether they have command of all their mental
capacities or suffer from some disability, the schools they attended, teachers
they had, whether the activity is a professional one or not, whether the worker
is from the country or from the city. Something else very important: whether
the worker handles or distributes goods or services of some kind, who the
bosses are, what image they project, how they speak, the way they look at
things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could fill pages talking about
the individual differences of every worker.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Therefore, what the people in our country need most is knowledge, if
what we want to do is create conscience.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Martí’s precept about the importance of
linking education and work in the formation of man, led us in the past to
promote the participation of university students and even students from the middle
level education in physical labor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At
first, this was an inescapable necessity. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had to fill the vacuum left by those who
abandoned the sugar cane fields en masse as soon as other work opportunities
appeared.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The average level of knowledge
was very low, even after the literacy campaign, the massive surge in primary
education and later at the junior high school level. Our youth understood this
and contributed their efforts with discipline and enthusiasm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Nowadays we have taken higher education to
the masses, beginning with the physicians and educators and continuing with the
social workers, those in the field of computer science, the art instructors, in
the universalization of university courses for a wide variety of degree courses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have to make the brain cells work if we
want to build consciences, so necessary in today’s complex world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The purpose of studying for one or two
weeks, and this year it will only be for 7 days, with proper materials that will
be supplied, will generate a feeling of satisfaction in time well spent and the
conscience that our society urgently needs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Throughout the entire year we must keep
ourselves informed about essential matters and about the details of what is
happening in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and in the rest of the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>On specific economic matters, I think that
in every country, most people are unaware of everything.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is inescapable to know why the cost of oil
is climbing; last Monday the price reached 77 dollars a barrel. Why the prices
of foods are increasing, such as wheat and others which must be imported
because of climate related problems; if the cause of their increase is
permanent or short-lived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Not all workers receive the incentive of
convertible pesos, a practice that became generalized in a large number of
companies during the Special Period, without always fulfilling the minimum
committed requirements. Not everybody receives convertible currency from
abroad, something which is not illegal but which at times creates irritating
inequalities and privileges in a country that does its utmost to supply vital
services free of charge to the entire population.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I do not mention the juicy profits being made
by those who transport people clandestinely, nor the way they would fool us by
changing the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
bills into other currencies in order to avoid our response measures against the
dollar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The real and visible lack of equality and
the lack of pertinent information gives way to critical opinions, especially in
the neediest sectors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In Cuba, without a doubt, those who some
way or another receive convertible pesos –even though in these cases the sums are
limited –or those receiving currency from abroad, also acquire free essential
social services, food, medicines and other goods at extremely low subsidized
prices. However we are strictly fulfilling our financial obligations precisely
because we are not a consumer society.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We need serious, brave and conscientious managers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Those using up gasoline all over the place
with our current fleet of vehicles of all kinds; those who forget that the
prices of food increase sharply and that raw materials for agriculture and
industry, many of whose products are distributed to all at subsidized prices,
must be acquired at market prices; those that forget that the country has the
sacred duty to struggle until our last drop of blood and must spend money for
raw materials and defensive measures faced with an enemy who is permanently on
guard, they can compromise the independence and life of Cuba.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We cannot fool around with that!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I was horrified when a few days ago I
heard a distinguished bureaucrat exclaim on TV that now that the Special Period
was over, we would be sending more and more delegations each year to such and
such activities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Where did this genius come from?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wondered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Perhaps it is a donation sent us by Sancho Panza from his Isle of
Barataria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the Special Period has
abated; but the world has fallen prey to a very special period, and we must
wait to see how it will come out in the end.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Billions of dollars are wasted in fuel. Not just as professional
wastrels, that’s a natural tendency, but also out of necessity to exchange
thousands of ancient Soviet motors, from a time when there was gasoline
aplenty, for Chinese motors that are very thrifty and have reasonable credit
facilities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This program has fallen
behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In the world economy, metals, just like
oil, rise above their historical parameters, but they also plummet abruptly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Of course, no one can remedy, in a short
time, the need for oil in personal and public transportation and for
agricultural or construction equipment. In developed countries everything is
mechanized.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Travelers describe how they
see building after building, of all kinds, rising up, and that the pace does
not stop, day or night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cities are
becoming gigantic.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are constantly
more millions of people who need drinking water, vegetables, fruits and protein
foods that have had to be produced and supplied by others often after
traversing great distances.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore,
they need highways with three or four lanes in both directions, bridges,
expensive works of engineering.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
least of accidents, a simple sideways brush between two vehicles, will paralyze
everything. Public expenditures are greater every day and development assistance
has decreased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Worst of all, for every thousand people
there are more than 500 private automobiles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
that number reaches almost a thousand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>People live or work at great distances.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Everybody has their own garage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Every workplace has its own parking lot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are not enough oil refineries.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Many of them need to be expanded and also new plants must be
constructed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The raw material for a
refinery is oil; the heavier it is the more we need and for a long time now
there have been no great oilfields of light oil coming to light.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A strike in Nigeria, the war in Iraq, the
threats to Iran, the old political conflicts in Europe, a tidal wave, a
hurricane, all of these send prices sky high.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The old and the new big consumers are always demanding more millions of
barrels per day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course, new nuclear
plants are growing at the same time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
am not discussing now the environmental or climate effects or dangers, but the
uncertainties that they unleash upon the real economy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>After spending a mountain of gold to
destroy <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Nixon replaced gold with paper bills, with hardly anyone noticing the
consequences.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>'
technological development was such, as was its capacity to produce industrial
and agricultural merchandise, especially its enormous military powerhouse, that
the replacement of gold by paper did not constitute a tragedy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Inflation of more than 10 % was produced, and
it was controlled. This was followed by the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> military build-up
voted in with papers, at the end of the Cold War, and the victory of the
consumer society which dazzles nations with its orgy of apparent wellbeing. The
empire acquired a large part of the world’s wealth with paper, imposing their <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
laws there, scorning the sovereignty of nations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The dollar went along progressively losing
its value until it reached less than 6 percent of what its value had been in
the 70’s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Experts are puzzled about the
new phenomena. Nobody is sure about what is going to happen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do we
have reasons to delve more deeply into these subjects, or not?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
