<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Many events important events take place around the
world. Some are related to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Sometimes, the news reaching our country are much more interesting than a
simple reflection I can offer with the purpose of raising the public's
awareness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>The BBC interview of Gerardo Hernández Nordelo, one
of our Five Heroes, which was televised yesterday, had a profound impact on me.
What human content, profundity and brilliance characterized it, qualities that
only a mind that has endured 9 years of unjust psychological torture can have.
We urge the Round Table to continue to inform us on the historic process
surrounding the fate of these, our heroic fellow Cubans. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Meanwhile, in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Brazil</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the press continues to dig
up stories and to report on the activities of the two boxers who, breaking the rules,
disappeared from the accommodations where the Cuban delegation was lodged. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>An EFE cable published in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Rio de Janeiro</st1:place></st1:City> on August 3 reports:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>“After being caught in a resort near <st1:place
w:st="on">Rio</st1:place>, where they spent some days with a Cuban and a German
businessman, and three prostitutes, the boxers were taken to a hotel in the
night; they are under custody by the Federal Police.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>“Ringodeaux and Lara were arrested at
Araruama last Thursday. According to the police, the boxers regretted what had
happened, they want to return to Cuba” <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and
alleged to have been the victims of a planned strike, for which they were</i> <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>drugged by the promoters before being taken
out of the Pan-American complex. The athletes turned down the offer of two
lawyers who approached them at Federal Police headquarters and insisted on
representing them. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>&quot;The Cuban athletes, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>however,</i> had been seen in different <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>resorts in the north coast of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Rio de Janeiro</st1:place></st1:City>, </i>enjoying
the resorts and partying full of alcohol and women”. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>According to the owners of inns located in the Squarema resort who were
interviewed by O Globo, the two boxers, accompanied by a Cuban and German
businessmen, spent several days in that city before traveling to Araruama,
accompanied by three prostitutes hired in Rio de Janeiro. 'They are good
people, they treated us as if we were their girlfriends and they even told us
they were going to miss us', one of the women declared, admitting to having
received nearly one hundred dollars a day, in her statements for O Globo&quot;.
<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>These are uncomfortable but essential
details and I cannot use terms different from those chosen by the press agency
in its article. I imagine the boxers informed their closest, adult relatives
about these facts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>Yesterday, August <st1:metricconverter
ProductID="6, a" w:st="on">6, a</st1:metricconverter> cable from the same
agency reported:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>The
Brazilian police stated it believed the story of the events recounted by the
two Cuban boxers who were deported to their country after they disappeared
during the Pan-American Games of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Rio
  de Janeiro</st1:place></st1:City>. They claimed they had been drugged and
deceived by two promoters who sought to take them with them to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>We
believe what they told us and we consider their story feasible and probable,
Federal Police captain Felicio Latera, who headed the investigation, told EFE
today<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>The
Brazilian police is not investigating the alleged desertion of the two Cubans,
it is investigating the two promoters who attempted to snatch them, the captain
declared. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>That same day, EFE reported in that
same cable that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>During
an interview with a Brazilian newspaper, German businessman Ahmet Öner, the
promoter of four Cuban boxers who have already secured asylum in Germany,
admitted that he organized Rigondeaux's and Lara's escape, for which he claims
to have paid nearly half a million dollars&quot;. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>We do not doubt that the Federal Police
thought the athletes' regret sincere. That institution was tasked with
securing, from the Cuban consulate, the documentation that the boxers were
urgently requesting and with giving an account of what had occurred to them in
their 12-day absence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>For the immense majority of our people,
who educate and train the athletes with so much sacrifice, what is essential is
their moral behavior.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>The person, who is most to blame, in my
opinion, is Erislandy Lara, who as captain of the boxing team broke the rules
and played directly into the hands of the mercenaries. He is a 24 years old
student of physical education and sports at the university. The two boxers are
unaware of the negative influence which their close friendships with the boxers
who were bribed in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Venezuela</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had on their behavior, and they likely did not predict the indiscrete verbiage
with which the owner of the mafia-like company was to speak after they failed
to attend the weight-in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>The two athletes were reluctant to
speak to the press. Miguel Hernández, a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Granma</i>
journalist, greeted them at the airport and conversed with them about the
matter. The answers were disappointing for him, who attempted to write a
convincing article proving the sincerity of the boxers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>Julita Osendi, a television reporter
who was well informed about the Pan-American Games held in <st1:place w:st="on">Rio</st1:place>,
arranged a meeting with them and made efforts to persuade them to speak with
absolute frankness. They were more forthcoming and shared with her a number of
additional details about their unusual adventure, but the final outcome of the
interview was the same. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>I asked comrade Fernández, the Vice-President
of the Council of Ministers responsible for the National Institute for Sports
and Recreation (INDER), among other institutions, to send me a transcription of
Osendi's interview with Erislandy Lara and Guillermo Rigondeaux. The images
were not enough for me; I wanted to analyze each question and answer. The text
is twice as long as this reflection. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>I will ask <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Granma </i>to publish it in the sports or another section, for there to
be a written record of the conversation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>Many poor countries face no problems
with their professional athletes but, in those countries, many people also die
prematurely or suffer incapacitating illnesses due to a lack of exercise. Rich
developed countries also endure this tragic state of affairs as a result of the
shortcomings of their rotten system and the commercial spirit of their medical
services. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>The athlete who abandons his delegation
is not unlike the soldier who abandons his fellow men in the midst of combat. <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region> has many
talented athletes but it has not stolen them from anyone. The people, what's
more, are the ones who enjoy their marvelous performances. It is already a part
of their culture, their wellbeing and their spiritual wealth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>The Revolution has kept its word. It
promised to treat the two athletes in a humane fashion, to reunite them with
their families immediately, offer them access to the press if they so requested
it and provide them with decent employment in accordance with their experience.
We have also diligently cared for their health, as we do with all citizens. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>It was essential, as an elementary act
of justice, to listen to them, to find out to what extent they regretted their
involvement in so painful an incident. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>We have made the facts we were able to
gather available to our people. The athletes wish to return to their families.
As part of a Cuban delegation of that sport discipline, they have reached a
point of no return. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>We, on the other hand, must continue
the struggle. The time has come to put together the list of Cuban boxers who
will participate in the Beijing Olympics, about one year before this event.
First, they must travel to the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> to participate in the World
Championship, one of the three qualifying events of the Olympic Games. Just
picture the mafia sharks lurking about in search of fresh meat. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>They should be warned of one thing: we
are not eager to make home deliveries. Cuba will not sacrifice one bit of
honor, nor any of its ideas, for Olympic gold medals; the morale and patriotism
of its athletes shall prevail above all else. We know that, in the world of
boxing, the size of the ring and gloves have been modified to strike at our
country, which wins so many medals in this sport, so as to finally include
professional boxing in the Olympic Games as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>Sport authorities are analyzing all
possible alternatives, including the option of changing the list of boxers or
of not sending any delegation whatsoever, in spite of the penalties that may be
in store for us. They are also analyzing strategies and tactics we could
follow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>We will maintain our principled policy,
even if the world heads more and more resolutely towards professionalism, and
as in the times of Kid Chocolate, a true genius, even when there are no medals
for healthy sports and the only conceivable disciplines are those which put a
price tag on pitching balls that are impossible to bat, batting homeruns and
throwing and enduring punches with no protection whatsoever. We will never
return to such a time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>Healthy sport practices are
incompatible with consumerism and wastefulness, phenomena which are at the root
of the irreversible economic and social crisis facing the globalized world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
