MALMIERCA: We summoned you to this meeting on the express request of President
Fidel Castro. He asked me to begin by expressing our appreciation for the
information on the assassination attempt on President Reagan that you provided
us with through director Joaquín Más. On behalf of President Fidel Castro, we
also wish to express how deeply we regret this event and our sincere hope that
President Reagan will recover from this attack as quickly as possible. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

consequences of the attack did not appear to be that severe, but it seems the

the radio they are now saying that the operation is to begin now. It is likely
to be over in, say, an hour. A 3-hour surgery, I mean, is nothing simple,
especially for a 70-year-old man. They say there's no danger. My interpretation
of this is that there's no immediate danger. But, for a 70-year-old man, a
3-hour surgery is a serious matter. They say he is not in serious condition,
that his condition is stable. We hope everything goes well. I thank you for
your best wishes, your concern and President Fidel Castro's message. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

sure, Reagan did change his policy towards Cuba in an electoral year, did not
honor the accord he signed which guaranteed the granting of up to 20 thousand
visas a year for safe trips by granting less than a thousand, and kept in
effect the Cuban Adjustment Act, which has cost Cuba many lives. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

recall any talk, that day, of the fact that, in the basements of those towers,
whose higher floors housed the banks of multinational corporations and other
offices, lay nearly 200 tons in gold bars. An order to shoot to death anyone
who attempted to get to the gold had been issued. The calculations with respect
to the steel structures, plane impacts, the black boxes recovered and what they
revealed do not coincide with the opinions of mathematicians, seismologists,
information, demolition experts and others. What is most shocking is the claim
that we may never know what actually happened. It is known, however, that a

the alleged plane created. No passenger that perished there has turned up,
either. No one in the world questioned the news about the attack on the

but to briefly summarize, at approximately 9:00 this morning, a Boeing
airplane, a really big one, crashed straight into one of the two New York
famous towers which make up one of the highest buildings in the world.
Naturally, the tower caught on fire because of all the fuel from such a big

undermined by deception, because –as we<b> </b>have said often times– in order
to mislead Americans to support an unjust cause, or an unjust war, they must
first be deceived. The classic method used by that huge country in
international politics is that of deceiving the people first, to count on their
support later. When it is the other way around, and the people realize that
something is unjust, then based on their traditional idealism they oppose what

there, by killing people here and there, using similar methods to theirs and
sacrificing innocent lives. It can only be won, among other ways, by putting an
end to State terrorism and other repulsive forms of killing, by putting an end
to genocide, and by seriously pursuing a policy of peace and respect for moral
