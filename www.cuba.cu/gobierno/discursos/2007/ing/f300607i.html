declassifying hundreds of pages on illegal actions that included plans to
eliminate the leaders of foreign governments. Suddenly the publication is
halted and it is delayed one day. No coherent explanation was given. Perhaps
someone in the White House looked over the material.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The first package of declassified
documents goes by the name of “The Family Jewels”; it consists of 702 pages on
illegal CIA actions between 1959 and 1973. About 100 pages of this part have
been deleted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It deals with actions that
were not authorized by any law, plots to assassinate other leaders, experiments
with drugs on human beings to control their minds, spying on civil activists
and journalists, among other similar activities that were expressly prohibited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The documents began to be gathered
together 14 years after the first of the events took place, when then CIA
director, James <span class=SpellE>Schlessinger</span> became alarmed about
what the press was writing, especially all the articles by Robert Woodward and
Carl Bernstein published in<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> The
Washington Post</i>, already mentioned in the “Manifesto to the People of
Cuba”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The agency was being accused of
promoting spying in the Watergate Hotel with the participation of its former
agents Howard Hunt and James McCord.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In May 1973, the Director of the CIA was
demanding that &quot;all the main operative officials of this agency must
immediately inform me on any ongoing or past activity that might be outside of
the constituting charter of this agency”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><span class=SpellE>Schlessinger</span>, later appointed Head of the
Pentagon, had been replaced by William Colby. Colby was referring to the
documents as “skeletons hiding in a closet&quot;. New press revelations forced
Colby to admit the existence of the reports to interim President Gerald Ford in
1975. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The New York Times </i>was
denouncing agency penetration of antiwar groups. The law that created the CIA
prevented it from spying inside the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>That “was just the tip of the iceberg”,
said then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Kissinger himself warned that “blood would
flow” if other actions were known, and he immediately added: “For example, that
Robert Kennedy personally controlled the operation for the assassination of
Fidel Castro”. The President’s brother was then Attorney General of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
He was later murdered as he was running for President in the 1968 elections,
which facilitated Nixon's election for lack of a strong candidate. The most
dramatic thing about the case is that apparently he had reached the conviction
that John Kennedy had been victim of a conspiracy. Thorough investigators,
after analyzing the wounds, the caliber of the shots and other circumstances
surrounding the death of the President, reached the conclusion that there had
been at least three shooters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Solitary
Oswald, used as an instrument, could not have been the only shooter. I found
that rather striking. Excuse me for saying this but fate turned me into a
shooting instructor with a telescopic sight for all the <span class=SpellE>Granma</span>
<span class=SpellE>expeditionaries</span>. I spent months practicing and
teaching, every day; even though the target is a stationary one it disappears
from view with each shot and so you need to look for it all over again in
fractions of a second.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Oswald wanted to come through <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region> on his trip to the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">USSR</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He had
already been there before. Someone sent him to ask for a visa in our country’s
embassy in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>
but nobody knew him there so he wasn’t authorized. They wanted to get us
implicated in the conspiracy. Later, Jack Ruby, --a man openly linked to the
Mafia-- unable to deal with so much pain and sadness, as he said, assassinated
him, of all places, in a precinct full police agents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Subsequently, in international functions
or on visits to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
on more than one occasion I met with the aggrieved Kennedy relatives, who would
greet me respectfully. The former president’s son, who was a very small child
when his father was killed, visited <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region> 34 years later. We met and I
invited him to dinner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The young man, in the prime of his life,
and well brought up, tragically died in an airplane accident on a stormy night
as he was flying to <st1:place w:st="on">Martha’s Vineyard</st1:place> with his
wife. I never touched on the thorny issue with any of those relatives. In
contrast, I pointed out that if the president-elect had then been Nixon instead
of Kennedy, after the <st1:place w:st="on">Bay of Pigs</st1:place> disaster we
would have been attacked by the land and sea forces escorting the mercenary
expedition, and both countries would have paid a high toll in human lives.
Nixon would not have limited himself to saying that victory has many fathers
and defeat is an orphan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For the record,
Kennedy was never too enthusiastic about the <st1:place w:st="on">Bay of Pigs</st1:place>
adventure; he was led there by Eisenhower’s military reputation and the
recklessness of his ambitious vice-president.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I remember that, exactly on the day and
minute he was assassinated, I was speaking in a peaceful spot outside of the
capital with French journalist Jean Daniel. He told me that he was bringing a
message from President Kennedy. He said to me that in essence he had told him:
“You are going to see Castro. I would like to know what he thinks about the
terrible danger we just experienced of a thermonuclear war. I want to see you
again as soon as you get back.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Kennedy
was very active; he seemed to be a political machine”, he added, and we were
not able to continue talking as someone rushed in with the news of what had
just happened. We turned on the radio. What Kennedy thought was now pointless.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Certainly I lived with that danger. <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region> was both the weakest part and the one that
would take the first strike, but we did not agree with the concessions that
were made to the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. I have already spoken of this
before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Kennedy had emerged from the crisis with
greater authority. He came to recognize the enormous sacrifices of human lives
and material wealth made by the Soviet people in the struggle against fascism.
The worst of the relations between the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United
 States</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region> had not yet occurred by April
1961. When he hadn’t resigned himself to the outcome of the <st1:place w:st="on">Bay
 of Pigs</st1:place>, along came the Missile Crisis. The blockade, economic
asphyxiation, pirate attacks and assassination plots multiplied. But the
assassination plots and other bloody occurrences began under the administration
of Eisenhower and Nixon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>After the Missile Crisis we would have not
refused to talk with Kennedy, nor would we have ceased being revolutionaries
and radical in our struggle for socialism. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region>
would have never severed relations with the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">USSR</st1:place></st1:country-region> as it had been asked to do.
Perhaps if the American leaders had been aware of what a war could be using
weapons of mass destruction they would have ended the Cold War earlier and
differently. At least that’s how we felt then, when there was still no talk of
global warming, broken imbalances, the enormous consumption of hydrocarbons and
the sophisticated weaponry created by technology, as I have already said to the
youth of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We would have had much more time to reach,
through science and conscience, what we are today forced to realize in haste.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span

Chaos, carrying on from 1969 for at least seven years, for which the CIA
created a special squadron with the mission to infiltrate pacifist groups and
to investigate “the international activities of radicals and black
militants”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Agency compiled more
than 300,000 names of American citizens and organizations and extensive files

Walter Elder who had been executive assistant to John McCone, CIA Director in
the early 1970s, gives information about discussions in the CIA headquarters
that were taped and transcribed: “I know that whoever worked in the offices of
the director were worried about the fact that these conversations in the office
and on the phone were transcribed. During the McCone years there were
microphones in his regular offices, the inner office, the dining room, the
office in the East building, and in the study of his home on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">White Haven Street</st1:address></st1:Street>. I don’t know if
anyone is ready to talk about this, but the information tends to be leaked, and
certainly the Agency is vulnerable in this case”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
