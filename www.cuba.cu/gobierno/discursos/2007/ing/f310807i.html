<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>On August 3, under the title of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>A Reflection on Hard and Obvious Realities</i>,
I published a number of remarks on the prerogatives of power and its effect on
human beings and quoted the arguments advanced by Colonel General Leonid
Ivashov, Vice-President of the Russian Academy for Geopolitical Affairs and
former Secretary of the Council of Defense Ministers of the Community of
Independent States and Chief of the Military Cooperation Department of the Russian
Federation’s Ministry of Defense. As I indicated on that occasion, Ivashov is a
well-informed man whose views are deserving of our people's attention. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>General
Ivashov’s analysis, which appeared in a note published by the Russian news
agency Ria Novosti last July 24, began by identifying the United State’s
economic, financial, technological and military dictatorship in today’s
international arena as the chief political tool wielded by that country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
will not reiterate General Ivashov’s arguments, which lead him to the
conclusion that, in order to neutralize the plans aimed at world hegemony,
alternative poles of power must be created. In this connection, I wish only to
draw attention to one of his main arguments:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

orbit includes the Community of Independent States (CIS); the Chinese, the
Indian, the Islamic and the Latin American civilizations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is an immense space where we could create
more equitable markets, our own stable financial system, our collective
security mechanisms and our philosophy, giving priority to the intellectual
development of man in the face of western modern civilization, which emphasizes
material goods and measures success by the number of mansions, yachts and
restaurants people have.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our mission is
to redirect the world towards justice and intellectual and spiritual growth.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of social organizations and the media, politicians and religious figures from
29 countries participated in this conference, organized by the Founding Council
of the Russian National Glory Centre and the Ministry of Culture and Union of
Cuban Writers and Artists, with the purpose of challenging current theories on
the clash of civilizations which are grounded in the exclusivist nature of
neoliberal globalization, the advocate of a single model which can be
confronted by encouraging dialogue among peoples, cultures, creeds and States
in search of common responses to the key challenges facing today's world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

remarks nor submit it to the press for publication at the time. However,
inspired by General Ivashov’s arguments and his reference to an alliance of
civilizations, I have reread that address, suppressed a number of paragraphs
which did not contribute anything new in essence and touched up a number of
details in terms of structure and style. On rereading the text, I was surprised
at the extent to which many of my current ideas and concerns were already
developed there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We are becoming aware of this problem only
now when it is almost too late to tackle it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>It is worthwhile indicating that the main
responsibility for the brutal destruction of the environment lies with the
consumer societies. They are the offspring of the old colonial metropolises and
of imperialist policies that also begot the poverty and backwardness which are today
the scourge of the overwhelming majority of humanity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>These societies, with only 20 percent of
the world population, consume two thirds of the metals and three fourth of the
energy produced in the world. They have poisoned oceans and rivers and contaminated
the air; they have weakened and opened holes in the ozone layer and saturated
the atmosphere with gases that impair climate conditions with catastrophic
effects that we are starting to feel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Forests are disappearing and deserts
growing while billions of tons of fertile soil end up in the oceans every year.

efforts for survival, even at the expense of Nature. The </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Third World</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> nations cannot be held accountable for
this, for only yesterday they were colonies and today they are still exploited
and plundered by an unjust world economic order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The solution cannot be to put off the
development of those who need it most. The truth is that everything that today
contributes to underdevelopment and poverty is tantamount to a flagrant attack
on the ecology. As a result, tens of millions of men, women and children perish
every year in the </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Third
 World</span></st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, far more
than in each of the two world wars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The unequal terms of trade, protectionism
and the foreign debt are also an assault on the ecology and facilitate the
destruction of the environment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>A better distribution of wealth and of the
technologies available in the world could spare humanity such devastation. Less
luxury and waste in a few countries could bring about a reduction of poverty
and hunger in a large part of the planet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Let’s put an end to the transfer of
lifestyles and consumer habits to the </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

style='font-family:Arial'> that ruin the environment. Let human life be more
rational. Let a just international economic order be implemented. Let science
work toward a sustainable development without contamination. Let the ecologic
debt be paid and not the foreign debt. Let hunger disappear and not man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

no longer exists, neither the pretexts for cold wars, the arms race nor

foster development in the </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:

and to thwart the planet’s ecologic destruction?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

think of the concepts of civilization and wonder, what are civilizations?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From my boyhood and my school days, which was
not so long ago (Laughter), it seems like it was just yesterday when I was
listening to the first concepts about the world and about history. It was said that
this world was civilized, and it was even said that the Europeans had come to
this hemisphere to bring us civilization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

also said that it was necessary go to Africa to civilize the Africans, and go
all the way to the Pacific region, to what was then called the Indian Ocean to
civilize the Indians, and the Indonesians;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>a bit further yet and they arrived in China, to civilize China.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

time now we have all heard about Marco Polo. As a boy I also heard of him, of
his voyages to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>. It is known that there had been a
Chinese civilization for a long time, just as there had been an Indian
civilization, a civilization there by the </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> I was invited to a village where a statue
had been built to honor a child who had died during one of the anti-apartheid

civilization in </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Africa</span></st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>We all
know that in Julius Caesar’s day and age he won his glory fighting with his
legions against the Barbarian Germanic tribes, and that after vanquishing the
Barbaric Frankish tribes he moved on to conquer Gaul, that is, in the Gallic
Wars, and he went as far as what today is Great Britain. He even had a wall
built in those islands because apparently he was unable to totally dominate
some of those peoples, and so they built a wall.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That same </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
 style='font-family:Arial'>Europe</span></st1:place><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'> –and I hold nothing against the Europeans, on the
contrary, I am in favor of peace among them (Laughter), and respect for the
dignity of all, and so why wouldn’t I respect the dignity of the Europeans. I
look at history because I’m meditating on it. At that time, when fifteen
centuries after Julius Caesar’s conquest of Gaul, the Spaniards –partly my
kingship–arrived in Mexico, they found there a civilization, a city that was
larger than any European city at that time, the city of Mexico, the capital of
the Aztecs, Tenochtitlán, a city built on a lake, a masterpiece of engineering,
with a prosperous and highly developed agriculture.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was larger than </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Paris</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Well, one
of the pretexts that I read by one of the writers of that time, Bernal Díaz del
Castillo, is that these people had to be civilized because they made human
sacrifices.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And if the people who made
human sacrifices had to be civilized, then I think that there are many in this
world that still need civilizing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I think,
for example, that those who bomb cities, terrorize millions of men, women and
children and then say that there were civilian casualties need civilizing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apart from the civilian casualties which
always occur during all bombings, and the Russians know about this better than
anyone else, because the Russians lived through the bombings of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Leningrad</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>. The Russians endured preemptive attacks.
The Russians remember that June 21st when the troops of Adolph Hitler, the
armored divisions, bolstered by thousands and thousands of aircraft, hundreds
of perfectly equipped divisions, tens of thousands of tanks and cannons,
launched a preemptive attack, with no previous warning, on that dark corner of
the world called the Soviet Union. The divisions penetrated the territory at
full speed, some towards </span><st1:City><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Those of
us who have been able to know and admire the great feats of the Russian people
know the terrible challenge they had to confront, suddenly, in a matter of
hours, while the soldiers from that famous Brest-Litovsk fortress, which so
gallantly and heroically defended itself, despite the surprise, were home on
leave. And while studying those events we observed something that speaks
volumes about the historic values of the Russian people. When everywhere else
the news of enemy tanks in the rearguard were the signal to surrender and hoist
the white flag, the Russians did not surrender, the Russians did not hoist the
white flag.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Sometimes,
one reflects on what might have happened if that people had been mobilized, if
the Russian Army and her allies had been in a state of combat alert.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We, an extremely small country, a tiny island
here near the powerful neighbor, many times we have had to foresee the dangers
and declare ourselves in a state of combat alert!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We are determined not to allow anyone ever to
take us by surprise and to catch us off our guard. I am not going to rummage
through history nor shall I speak of accountability. The truth is, however,
that if the Russian people and her armed forces had been mobilized, I know very
well where World War II would have ended; not in Berlin, but in Lisbon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I dare say this here with every sense of
responsibility. I have thought about this many times because I have read many
history books about that war, written by people on both sides.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We all know that millions and millions of men
and women died; the figure has been given of 15, later 20 and later 27 million
people from that multinational Soviet state; then and now as well, of course,
Russia is largely a multinational State, but tens of millions died, and I think
it was mostly due to the surprise. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In our
country, a great many books were published, even, while great dangers
threatened us. We resorted to heroic Russian literature.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And so, books were printed in the hundreds of
thousands to instill in our people the idea that when the people fight and when
the people resist they can face up to any difficulty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I mean
that for us that heroism of the Russians is not something that we have read
about like the heroism of, let’s say, those who fought in Numancia and Sagunto,
against the Roman troops, until the very last man, until the extermination of a
population. In this case we have lived together through a part of history, a
difficult part. You had lived through it earlier and we have lived through it
later, constantly threatened with an invasion. And we were not threatened by
the Grand Cayman island lying south of Cuba, with an area of some square
kilometers and perhaps 8,000 or 10,000 inhabitants; we have been threatened by
a country which 8, 9 or 10 million square kilometers and a populations of
almost 300 million, by the power which, from a technical, economic and military
point of view, has prevailed over the last 60 years, the United States
superpower.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is a great danger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>And we
were inspired by the deeds of the Soviet people --I must say this, I should not
hesitate to call them so--<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>for we know
that the soul of that resistance, the axis of that resistance, the heart of
that resistance, was the Russian people,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>the heroism of other peoples who fought alongside the Russians
notwithstanding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Retamar

  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Russia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> by Napoleonic troops. Napoleon was a
revolutionary, a representative of that great revolution, an undisputable
military genius, but a military genius in the midst of a revolution. But,
really, without the French Revolution there would have been no Napoleonic
military genius. He would have lived his life on his small </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is not men
who make history, it is history that makes men or the great figures and
personalities; men interpret events, in one way or another, but they are born
from history.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We see here the Venezuelan
ambassador, our friend Adán (Adam) who bears the name of the first human being
who lived on this planet; he represents the country of Bolívar, but as I was
saying, without those historical processes, the name Bolívar would be unknown
today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>It was the
great crisis, Napoleon's occupation of Spain, the imposition of a French king
in that country, a brother of the emperor –who I believe was a bit of a fool–
that caused a rebellion, first as an act of loyalty, not by Bolívar but
certainly by that society represented at the time by the wealthiest sectors,
the ruling sectors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>But those
historical events, that revolution, made it possible that today we know about
Bolívar. This would not have been the case if Bolívar had been born 30 years
earlier or 30 years later.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The name of
Martí would not be known, and we would not know the names of many of histories
greatest figures whose reputation, more than their merits, sprang out of
historical events. I say this about the great figures: Martí, the moment when
he was born the son of a Spanish soldier, both mother and father were
Spaniards, he was born with an enormous sensitivity, he was born on this soil
at a time of crisis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, the
great historical events are a product of crises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I say this
because, history –and there are many interpretations of history– is made up of
a series of events and advances from one era to another.<span

those civilizations which sprang up before the Greeks and the Romans, are
teaching us many things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I think
that the history of man is a history of wars, it’s a history of conquests, it’s
a history of some peoples dominating other peoples, of some groups being
dominated by other groups.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At a certain
moment empires emerged, but the </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

over there that famous terracotta army, which has been dug up by the Chinese.

these eras great values were being created, in all eras, from the one that
preceded ours; the philosophers who preceded our era, the Greek philosophers,
sprang up precisely before our era. It is said that Aristotle was Alexander the
Great’s tutor. That has been recounted in the histories written by real pundits
were familiar with the habits of those times and who explain how Aristotle was
the tutor for the son of Philip of Macedonia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In other
words, each one of these stages was creating values, each one of these stages
was creating cultures that were accumulating; but, when we speak of
civilization, we cannot forget about the Mayan civilization which had knowledge
of space, or the Aztec civilization, or the Inca civilization or the Pre-Inca
civilizations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

spoken with eminent men such as [Thor] Heyerdahl, the famous author of the <i

explorer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He dedicated his life to the
study of ancient civilizations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
worked a lot in Peru and he told me how there were things and designs that
could only be seen from an altitude of 2,000 or 3,000 meters, stretching over
the plains, constructions that were feats of engineering such as had not
existed in Europe when this hemisphere was conquered.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And so what did these civilizations bring to
us?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Up to which point did they conquer
us? Almost until today, and I say &quot;almost&quot;, because many of us are
still conquered and dominated by other civilizations that rule over the remnants
of those that existed in this hemisphere, and this, keeping in mind the great
values which the conquerors brought with them, because they all created
values.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All civilizations created
values, but values that have clashed against each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
I hear this phrase, “Dialogue among Civilizations”, what crosses my mind is the
idea of an accumulation of values, an amalgamation of the values of all
civilizations. Just as when we speak of teaching people to read and write, I
think of providing the unschooled with those values they have not been able to
obtain, because they had no one to teach them or no school to go to. When one
speaks of teaching people to read and write, one thinks of that, of passing on
values. But we must also ask ourselves what values, exactly what values we are
passing on?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
was moved by the words that were spoken about saying goodbye to chauvinism,
saying goodbye to narrow-minded nationalism, saying goodbye to hatred, saying
goodbye to intolerance, saying goodbye to prejudice, by gathering all that is
good in all cultures and all civilizations and all religions, by teaching
everyone a universal ethic which is dearly needed in this neo-liberal and
globalized world which began by globalizing egoism, globalizing vice,
globalizing frantic consumerism, globalizing the attempts at stealing the
resources of others, and making slaves of them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is said that slavery dates back to primitive times and that, as soon as
humanity became involved in production and learned that people could produce
for themselves and for others, rather than murder its prisoners, it began to
preserve them. This is what is said and it may be very true, but slavery would
persist for thousands of years afterwards. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is said that the passage from Roman slavery to feudalism which took place in
Europe in what was called the Middle Ages, was a great step forward, up until
the very moment they discovered us here. I say “us” because, even though I
share in the blood of the discoverers, I consider myself a son of this land and
this island, and, above all else, a son of humanity. This land knew a great
patriot, a great philosopher who once said —and not at the time of
internationalism, this man was struggling for his homeland's independence
against Spanish colonialism— but he said a phrase that ought to be remembered
for all time: &quot;Homeland is humanity&quot;. That man's name was, is and
will always be José Martí. See this: &quot;Homeland is humanity&quot;. Here,
where the representatives of more than 25 countries, where scientists,
intellectuals and religious leaders have gathered to hold this dialogue among
civilizations, have you not been moved by the feeling, have you not had a sense
that your homeland is humanity?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
stress this point because I hate chauvinism; I revile chauvinism as I revile
many other things that have characterized humanity in its long journey
throughout its brief history…no one knows whether Homo Sapiens first appeared
50, 100 or several hundreds of thousands of years ago. Archaeologists spend
their lives looking for skulls to determine at which point in the evolution of
the species humanity arose. I mention this without fear of offending anyone,
even if I know there are many religious people here, because the leader of the
Catholic Church himself, some years ago, declared —courageously, in my
opinion—that the theory of evolution is not irreconcilable with the doctrine of
creation. I don't know, of course, how other religions view this issue. I
respect them all, as I respect all points of view. I limit myself to offering
you an example of how the Catholic Church interprets this knowledge. These are
new phenomena, for churches have learned from experience and have attempted to
broaden their points of view and their conceptions in their search for good. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I was
educated in religious schools; I was critical, and I can still be so, of the
way in which they taught me religion, a very dogmatic way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everyone is not born the same and everyone
has their own character, their own personality.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I reject those things that they tried to force on me, or that they
forced me to believe without persuading me about, those things they wanted me
to believe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, everyone has their own
way of reacting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>But I can
say that the churches themselves have been making an effort.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Catholic Church has criticized the crimes
that were committed, the conquest of this hemisphere with great violence; they
have criticized the Inquisition, they have criticized the condemnation of
Galileo, they have condemned those horrible acts such as the burning of
heretics at the stake. The first native to revolt in this country --he was a
peaceful man, and he was not even a Cuban-- came from Santo Domingo where there
was a much more combative population. His name was Hatuey and he was condemned
to burn at the stake; and there a priest was sent to persuade him to be
baptized so that he could go to heaven, and the story goes that he asked
–whether it is true or not, I say it is a lovely story;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>we have been taught this right from primary
school –he is said to have been asked whether the Spaniards went to Heaven and
when he was told that, yes, they did, that rebellious native said: “Then, I
would rather die, I don’t want to go to such Heaven where Spaniards go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Look at
that lesson, how every man who lives leaves us something.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That rebel died with those words on his lips,
which may be true or not, but he at least inspired them. Consider that
beautiful example of dignity, of heroism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>And I was
speaking about all the mistakes we have made and which we must overcome and the
values we have created that we must bring together.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus I interpret what could be termed a
dialogue among civilizations, whose spirit I share one hundred percent and
which makes me happy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wish I could one
day participate fully in a dialogue and not just in its closing ceremony and not
have to find out about it from a summary of all that was discussed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Our
distinguished visitor, whom we have received with much satisfaction, and we
know that it is not his fault that he arrived late --we could call this a
contradiction in views, a contradiction of civilizations—he was speaking about
the satisfaction with which they were awaiting the next dialogue to be held in
Greece, where all those who wanted to, could attend, I was reminded of a recent
occurrence that I, sports lover that I am, that I always have been wanting to
see one of the Olympic Games, which I have never attended, even when I could
have gone; but I thought that I had the right to participate in the Olympics,
if I wanted to, and there in Greece many people invited me, even people from
the Greek Orthodox Church, and they promised that they would take me to see a
famous monastery.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And truly, my mind is
overflowing with ideas, memories, things they told me, the marvelous things
they told me about the history of that church and what they have accomplished
and what they have created. It was very interesting having the Patriarch of the
Greek Orthodox Church visit me precisely on the day we were inaugurating the
Orthodox Church building. And<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>we have
also been talking about laying the first stone of a Russian Orthodox church;
there will also be a cathedral here, to all of our satisfaction, in the same
way that there is a mosque in our city, and in the same way all the religions
are represented. We have this honor and we are pleased and honored that they
are all represented here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I think
that our country has been an example of how ecumenism can exist not just in the
religious terrain but also in the respect of the sentiments of all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I could
not be ecumenical with those who deny other people their right to think and
their right to believe, because for us, we who are so often accused of
violating human rights, I shall say nothing more other than that the first
human right is the right to think, the right to believe, the right to live, the
right to learn, the right to know dignity, the right to be treated like any
other human being, the right to be independent, the right to sovereignty as a
people, the right to dignity as a human being.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>We really
think that to discuss human rights, a sort of Olympics would have to be
organized, getting us all together, the accused with all the frauds and
hypocrites in the world today, and assemble together in a room like this one to
debate what human rights are, which ones we have violated and which ones we
have defended for dozens of years, without ever abandoning our principles. You,
many of whom are religious persons –and I am not a religious person in the
traditional sense of the word– at the end of the road<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>could remember religious characters and God
forbid, I am not comparing ourselves with any other character in history.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am not just myself; I speak for the people
of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:

style='font-family:Arial'>, I represent thousands, hundreds of thousands,
millions of human beings who live in this island. I don't assume to compare
myself to anyone; but this island has been more slandered than the early
Christians, it has been more slandered than those who were devoured by the
lions in the Roman circuses, more slandered than those who were forced to live
in the catacombs because of their faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>There are
religious beliefs and there are political beliefs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are religious convictions and there are
political convictions. And I mean it in the best sense of the word because
everything political has been so discredited.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are political ideas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
conceive political ideas to be those that are truly worth the life of a man, of
a man’s sacrifice, of a man’s life, of a man’s death; or that of many men, of
an entire people if necessary, who would sacrifice themselves in defense of
those values, whoever defends values and knows that without values there is no
life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I say more, without values
there is no civilization; even more, without values, this humanity cannot
survive, because when we speak of civilizations –and we know there were many,
and just as many have disappeared –we might also wonder how long these
civilizations will last if we do not take the relevant steps just as you are
trying to do here so that not just civilization but the species can survive.
Because for the first time in the long march through a brief history, the
survival of humanity is in jeopardy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
would invite anyone to answer and tell me if there was ever any other time like
today when the survival of the species was in danger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>In the past, it was the </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Roman Empire</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, before that Greek or Greco-Roman
civilization; in earlier times it was the Egyptian, Persian and the
already-mentioned Mesopotamian civilizations. That is to say, the two
hemispheres have known civilizations, because man took civilization with him
wherever he went. It has been shown that human beings on this side of the </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Atlantic</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> had the same level of mind development
and the same intelligence as those who remained in the </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Old World</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>. And geophysicists, those who have
studied the Earth know that, ages ago, the two hemispheres did not yet exist,
that 350 million years ago there was only one continental landmass. These
hemispheres are also the product of an evolution governed by the laws of
physics, of geology. That compact mass began to split, this hemisphere split
off from that mass, Antarctica split off, Australia split off, all continents
began splitting off from it. We all know how the Himalayas came into being, the
movements of the tectonic plates that created all manner of formations, and 350
million years ago there were no human beings around; not even 300 million years
ago. Oil deposits were beginning to form around that time. That oil, apparently
so marvelous and perhaps marvelous indeed, that civilized man has all but
destroyed in barely 200 years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>This is now the year 2005, and I wonder
just how much oil will remain in the world in 91 years. In 1896, the world
spent 6 million tons of oil a year and today consumption amounts to 82 million
barrels, that is, nearly 12 million tons of oil every day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>One hundred nine years ago, again, homo
sapiens —and just how sapient humanity is, dear friends, is still to be
established—109 years ago it spent 6 million tons of oil a year and today it is
spending nearly 12 million every day, and consumption is increasing at a pace
of 2 million barrels of oil per day each year. There is not enough oil to go
around and it is becoming more and more expensive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>And I am limiting myself to but one
problem, the energy problem. We could ask ourselves how long this easily-accessible
energy is going to last our civilized neighbors, I don’t mean the people, I
mean that very civilized government —and do forgive me for mentioning a
government in particular, I don't want to mention any because I don’t want to
offend anyone— but that policy, or whatever you wish to call it, that is so
civilized and humanitarian, opposed to the Kyoto Protocol, a simple and modest
attempt to contain atmospheric contamination, that policy deserves our
repudiation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>That country is spending 25% of the
world’s energy. Today, there is an oil crisis, and it will not go away. The
latest, most serious one was in 1975. It is said that oil is expensive today.
No, oil was truly expensive in 1975. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We're not in the oil business. Even if we
were, I am not defending any one doctrine here, I am merely saying that, if oil
becomes more expensive, so much the better; because, if they're going to
contaminate the world, the more expensive oil is, the greater the hope of
having it last a few more years before we are poisoned or intoxicated to death,
before they finally change the world's climate completely, the greater the hope
that we will see some rainfall. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We are facing the most severe drought that
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>’s history has known. The other day, when
I heard a clap of thunder, I felt as though I was in another country, not
unlike what I experienced when I visited </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Russia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> and saw snow for the first time. When I
suddenly came across the snow, which I had never seen before, well, just as
astonished was I some weeks ago when I heard thunder. Thunder usually heralds
the rain, and I discerned a light drizzle, some clouds, I felt I was in another
country, for it's been months since this country has seen any rain. There was
some rainfall recently but not in the country's eastern region. There, there is
a terrible drought. Hundreds of thousands of homes are currently getting their
water from trucks and millions of animals are getting it from water-tank
trucks. Currently, we are constructing numerous emergency aqueducts, using PVC tubes
that allow us to construct and set up these pipelines quickly and transport the
water, now, when fuel prices are —I won't say high—on the rise. And there is
more and more competition for control over that fuel. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Just calculate how many trucks are transporting
water. Why do I mention this? We don't have to wait until hell freezes over
—one can't help but talk about climate change, it seems— we are doing this now.
A drought like this one obliges us, not to say farewell to arms, as Hemingway
wrote —we can't say farewell to arms just yet— but farewell to the idea of
depending on the sugar industry or sugarcane, for sugarcane plantations require
water. We filled this country with water reservoirs; today, they are empty.
There are some here and there that have some water. But we have not lost hope,
we have confidence that it will rain. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I see, for instance, that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Venezuela</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> gets a lot of rain, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Venezuela</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> is a case in point: in one place, it
rains too much, in another, too little. The world’s climate has been disturbed;
it’s the least we can say, as a result of environmental pollution. This is the
reason I said that, if the high price of oil is going to make the lunatics a
little more sane, make the lunatics stop wasting natural resources and
destroying the planet's natural habitats, so that civilizations can continue to
exist and engage in dialogue —for, in order to engage in dialogue, one must, of
necessity, be alive—then so much the better. Let us not forget that philosopher
who said &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;. We could just as well say: in
order to think, one must first exist, to engage in dialogue, one must survive,
and to survive, one must struggle with resolve. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I am not exaggerating. I am firmly
convinced that I am not exaggerating when I say that we must struggle and do it
with the utmost determination, again, if we want civilizations to survive, if
we want the species responsible for these civilizations, whatever its
shortcomings and mistakes may be, to survive. It is through this lens that I
have observed the dialogue you have had and the meeting you’ve held, and the
gathering you are to hold next year in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Greece</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, a gathering which, unfortunately, I will
not be able to attend should you invite me, because, invitations aside, I was
forbidden to go to the Olympics. They didn't tell me that this was forbidden
me, though many explicit prohibitions apply to me in this world: it is
forbidden for me to live; I am constantly avoiding death, surviving, more or
less. I am involved in a constant struggle for survival, for there are those
who wish that I do not survive and are constantly doing everything in their
power to see to this. Now, they're a bit more relaxed because I am getting
older, they think nature is going to do their work for them. But I also know
how impatient they are (Laughter). You can't be too careful, you know what I
mean?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>In an article, I read something along the
lines of: “Castro has not been invited” to the Olympics. This is false. Someone
from a paper, a slanderer, said that Castro was going to attend the Olympics,
and, immediately, the government spokespeople there reacted. I don't know which
government they represented, I don't even know what party is in power there,
nor am I hugely interested in knowing, forgive me if I am been disrespectful. I
don't know if it’s a left-wing or right-wing party —you would know this better
than I— I don’t know if they have a new government, if there’s been elections,
if there’s been change. It‘s all the same to me but, well, it would be
unfortunate if they invited me to a conference there and I was unable to
attend, because of the many hurdles one has to skirt when one is being hunted
down everywhere. I still face a number of restrictions. I am forced to use two
planes to travel, even though, as you all know, I am one of the “wealthiest”
men in the world. That's what was said in a two-penny </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> magazine which has not yet gotten its due
from me, because I have been occupied with other matters these days. But
they're going to get the answer that's coming to them, they've been singing
that tune for years now and they've forced me to react. What can you do? I'll
respond but I am in no rush, I have much more important things to do. Tomorrow
I have to see to very important matters, matters I have been seeing to for some
time and I don't want to waste a minute. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>But I was saying that, as they say, I am
one of the world's wealthiest men, according to them. This convention centre,
where you have gathered, is mine, so don't forget to pay up. I don't know if
the tour operators have charged you, but you should know that according to them
this convention center is mine, just like all the country's research centers,
schools and hospitals we are building, the tens of thousands of doctors and
hundreds of thousands of university professionals that the Revolution has
trained. From their point of view, I own this country, including the few fish
that remain, that's all mine, get it, the birds that come and go, that fly over
this country, they're mine. They even say that this convention center is mine,
that it’s a business. One cannot but laugh, and, as they say, he who laughs
last laughs loudest (Applause). I am going to strike back at that magazine, put
them in check; they’re going to regret this. But I don’t want to talk about
that now; I don't want to get sidetracked. It's just to warn you, since we're
speaking of wealth, and they say that I am one of the wealthiest men in the
world. I think they put me in the sixth place, I don't know which place you are
in [pointing at somebody in the audience] but they've said that you are someone
who, as a decent businessman, has had great success. Well, what about Bill
Gates? They say he is one of the richest, though I believe some rivals are
popping up here and there, in some fashion or other. What is by no means
justifiable is that I should be rich, I say it in all honesty, it is
unjustifiable, I have no right to be rich. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>When I was a young man, my father had some
money and they said I was rich. As rich as owning a large estate makes you, not
as rich as Bill Gates is or anything close to that. But I am not a rich man,
nor do I have the right to be so. And here I am, discussing these topics with
you. But I have to use two planes to travel anywhere, as I said, because, if a
‘stinger’ is lying in wait to take down my plane, I have to have a card up my
sleeve to confuse them. Sometimes, my plane lands first, then the other. There
have been times when I have taken off from somewhere and I have said: “turn off
all of the lights”, because I imagine someone pointing a ‘stinger’ at the
plane. So, if you’re thinking of inviting me there, you should know I am
putting my life at risk, a life I appreciate today more than ever. Do you know
why? Oh, because I want to devote the little time I have left and the experience
I have accumulated over the years to what we are doing now. I don't ask much,
two or three short years will suffice, we are going to take the fullest
advantage of nearly 50 years of experience in this field (Applause).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>If I say I don’t want to place my life at
risk, I don't mean to say I tremble at the prospect of dying tomorrow. No, not
really; I am at ease, I have the utmost serenity and patience. But I am also
hugely enthusiastic about what we are doing right now and, if you wish, if you
are patient, and provided it's before, say, </span><st1:time Minute="0"
Hour="20"><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>8:00 pm</span></st1:time><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, I can tell about other things that may
prove of interest to you. I didn't come here to speak to you of things that
interest me only, I have tried to discern what could be of interest to you, I
have tried to follow some of your ideas, though I feel you have asked questions
and discussed things here that are not exactly related to these matters. I
began to philosophize a bit on civilizations and ended up talking about this. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I feel that the most significant thing I
could say is that I am convinced that the survival of the species is at stake,
that the species faces real dangers. If you have come from so far and have had
the immense patience of waiting to hear me speak to you, if I owe you a
statement of significance, the most significant thing I can say is this, that I
have this feeling and that conviction, and that these are not based on
fantasies but on facts, on calculations, mathematics, the conviction that
humanity faces true risks, that we must not only achieve peace but save the
species. And I believe the species can be saved. I would not speak about this
if I were a pessimist, if I thought the problem could not be overcome. I
believe it can and I am used to facing difficult problems. These are not the
words of someone given to idle fancy: I believe the problem can be solved and
that this is the most important thing. But I will move on to other issues. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>What I was going to say is that he

  style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>. He was stopped there and he showed them
his good will. I avail myself of the time, weigh this and that other option.
No, I wasn't going to go to the Olympics, because we truly have important tasks
ahead of us. I didn't even go to the ones held in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Barcelona</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> because I was participating in an

however, keep track of the number of medals won by Cuban athletes. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> has the greatest number of gold medals
per capita in sports, of Olympic medals of every kind. I don’t say this with a
chauvinistic spirit, although we too can be chauvinistic when it comes to
sports. I don't allow myself this, not even with respect to sports. It's true I
am pleased when a Cuban team wins, as one would expect, but I am always capable
of recognizing the merits and the talent of an adversary that beats us fair and
square at a sporting event. This is not the case in boxing, innumerable gold
metals have been stolen from us in boxing, because this sport is governed by a
mafia. There are sports which are governed, not by an Olympic spirit, but by
mafias. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> this right because it was the cradle of
the Olympics, more than 2,000 years ago. The man who came, running, to announce
the results of a battle...which, of the many wars that were waged, was that
one? One of the many battles, the thousands of battles that there have been.
War has been humanity’s almost exclusive vocation. (Someone says: “the battle
of </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Marathon</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>”). That was its name. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span

 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Thermopylae</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, a peasant announced the arrival of 2
million soldiers. The story of the 2 million soldiers is not true. When I read
the story in primary school, I thought it was true, that that many men had
passed through there. One day, when I was visiting </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Turkey</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> for an international gathering, I crossed
the </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Bosporus</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, where they say the vessels were when
Xerxes’ army of two million came, and the Spartans were lying in wait at the </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Thermopylae</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> with only 300 soldiers. Ask the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> Chief of Staff how 2 million soldiers can
be deployed. You need a whole merchant fleet, a whole air force to deploy 2
million men, and much more if they're accompanied by stocks of Coca Cola, ice
cream and first-class food. I don't know how well-fed those Persian soldiers
were. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>But there was another battle, of the many
waged by the Greeks, and then the marathon competitions came into being. And,
since you were the founders of the Olympics, and with everyone’s support,
including ours —because we had defended </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Greece</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>’s right to host the Olympics— you will
have your Olympics. Greece is the only country which is not rich that has had
the privilege of hosting the Olympics, because, 2,000 years ago, it had the
fortune of receiving the good news that it had won a battle against one of the
empires of the time. What a pity! At the </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
 style='font-family:Arial'>Bay of Pigs</span></st1:place><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>, we too could have sent a runner at full speed to
take the news to Oriente that the mercenary forces had been defeated in less
than 72 hours, in another small battle in which the Revolution proved
victorious over some mercenary troops escorted by a </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

but the idea didn't cross our heads, because we had phones, the radio and all
that, and there was no need for anyone to run anywhere. But here we faced an
empire as powerful as that one. There was a small battle, the battle of Girón. </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Marathon</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, Girón, a poem could even be written, a
rhyming verse. There are certainly enough poets in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Well, that's why you got to be host of the
Olympics. Now, they are already discussing the big investments. You have to be
a multimillionaire. After a lot of work and becoming one of the motors of the
world economy, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>China</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> will finally host an Olympics. It will host
the Olympic Games of 2008. I don’t know who’s going to beat the Chinese at
organizing a spectacle like the Olympics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I have insisted on this issue to express
my appreciation, to tell you how important I consider this gathering to be, to

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Many important issues were taken up here:
regional and international issues, issues related to peace. I hope the speeches
delivered will be published and spread, that they become available to more than
just a handful of people. The discussions struck me as very valuable and open.
Everyone expressed their opinion without any kind of apprehension. Everyone
expressed the truth as they saw it and I think it has been worth our time. I
offer you all our support, all of the assistance that we can offer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span

  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Russia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> present at this conference. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I recalled the experiences we shared in
the course of 30 years of history. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Russia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>'s cooperation was very valuable to us. At
the time, it was Soviet cooperation, because there still existed a Soviet
state. Today, it is the Russian state. The Russian state inherited practically
all of the fundamental powers and responsibilities of the Soviet state, its
membership at the United Nations, its prerogatives as a powerful country, and,
today, Russians are duty-bound to defend it, because it faces the undeniable
risk that an egotistical, imperialist policy, an irresponsible policy, a
war-mongering policy could prevail. All of us face risks, not only Cubans,
Koreans, Russians, Chinese, the whole world faces risks. Let no one be so
deluded as to imagine that Europeans are exempt from these dangers, much less
when economic and commercial competition, competition in the struggle to secure
raw materials, energy and natural resources, is becoming fiercer and fierce
among those who want to own it all. And I am not referring to the people of the
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United
  States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang=EN-US

not mere diplomacy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

pre-emptive attack was launched against the Soviet Union, I was taken back to
words I heard recently, spoken at a US military academy, when the leader of
that other powerful country told officials there that they had to be ready for
a pre-emptive attack on any dark corner of the world. In the blink of an eye, he
spoke of 60 or more countries and we, who were listening to him, know that we
are one of the darkest corners of the world, due to their idiosyncrasy and
fundamentalism, their technology and ignorance —yes, we mustn’t exclude
ignorance. To be ignorant means to know absolutely nothing of the world, of the
world’s problems, of world reality. Ignorance, the ignorance I am referring to,
means being completely oblivious, and the world is in trouble when the most
powerful superpower that has ever existed, capable of destroying the planet
twenty or thirty times over, is led by people who are completely oblivious to
it. We would all have heart attacks were we not strong at heart, were we not
equipped with strong consciences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

become that numerous and that, 130 years later, reached the figure of 2 billion

went from 5 to 6 billion inhabitants. Let us not forget that. There are
currently 6.5 billion inhabitants in the world. Whoever has any idea of the
poverty that exists in the world, the backwardness, the hunger, the diseases,
the shortage of homes, the lack of hygiene, the poor health conditions which prevail
in this world where there are African countries in which the life expectancy is

spoke of wars. I could say to you what I have told many comrades that this
species evolved, it produced man, and man is truly a marvelous creation worthy
of survival. I have great confidence in man, in his creative capacity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Why
has education been of the essence in our efforts to date? Because human beings
are born as a bundle of instincts. Education is the process whereby values are
instilled into this being moved by a plethora of instincts. Deprive that being
of education, leave it in an incubator, at the mercy of a machine that cares
for it and feeds it and you'll see what sort of education it has, if what US
filmmakers dreamt of can actually result from that: Tarzan, the ape man, the
man from the films of our childhood who was born who knows where in Africa, the
Tarzan we were brought up with, the intelligent man surrounded by tribes whose
pots were always boiling and who were ever ready to eat each other. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Yes,
that was the ideology they instilled in us when were children, that Africans
were cannibals, that they ate each other. Yes, we saw many movies like that,
it's a wonder we are not all racists and ultra reactionaries, given the movies
we watched.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Yes,
we have been given lethal doses of barbarism, lethal doses of ignorance, and
lethal doses of lies. That, however, has not destroyed our country’s ideas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
has to do with what I stress: education is passing on the positive values
created by human beings, the values I said we had to bring together. For us,
this has been of the essence: the creation and the accumulation of values. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Will
lies or values we have sown prevail? Will humanity make true values prevail
over lies? Will we have to own the big television networks? Is it
indispensable? No, let us become the owners of knowledge, even if we are only a
minority. Let us be owners of information, let us avail ourselves of those same
technical means to communicate with each other, because, while there are
networks that spread lies, there can also be networks of computers through
which someone can communicate with someone else who lives in Australia, in the
United States or in any corner of the world and exchange ideas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For
instance, we have made use of television for this purpose. Until recently, there
were only two television channels in our country. Today, there are four and 62%
of televised programs are educational, that is, devoted to spreading
educational, cultural and informational materials, aimed at cultivating a
wholesome culture in people. There are recreational programs, but we try to
make these an educational instrument, to make of culture a way to instill
values in people; we strive to show any good film made in any part of the
world, to multiply the values that underpin it and those who made it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
no longer use television to teach people to read and write. We use television
for higher levels of education, to disseminate university courses and language
classes. We use the media for this. Put to good use, the media, radio and
television could put an end to the scourge of illiteracy in the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Why
are there still 800 million illiterate and billions of semi-illiterate people
in the world? If there is radio, if there is television, why are there still
billions of illiterate and semi-illiterate people? This is the question we
should ask ourselves. We have the means to eradicate illiteracy in but a few
years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

you do the math from 1959 on, when that hypocritical oligarchy came to power

phenomenon which scourges the </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

  style='font-family:Arial'>Russia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>. Money, ill-gotten or not, is siphoned
out, because, we’re no longer talking about the gold you bury in a pot, we’re
talking about paper, and that paper is devalued every day. If you want to hold
on to it, you trade it in for hard currency. It must be what I did to amass the
personal fortune they ridiculously say I have. Yes, you have to change it into
convertible hard currency and deposit it in a bank. But only I know where I
keep my money. I sent it to Mars, it’s in Mars, they can find it there, the CIA
can find it there if it wants to. I’m going to reveal the secret, the truth is
I don’t remember exactly where I hid it, really, I put it away either in Mars
or the Moon, to keep it safe, so that, in my fourth, fifth or tenth
reincarnation, I could rent a light place and go look for it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Since
we are on the subject of currencies and we’re talking about money, they take
away money, ill-gotten or not, and they have to take it because there is a world
economic order, whose watchdog is an institution called the International
Monetary Fund, which obliges states to deposit their reserves in foreign banks.
When someone comes along with the required documents to say: &quot;I am taking
these funds with me&quot;, they are obliged to say where to. If they do not
comply, they are condemned; they are not given one cent. These were the methods
they used when they were super powerful. Fortunately, they are becoming less
and less powerful. The system's growing inability to prevent recessions and the
ever more feeble financial mechanisms behind it are becoming more and more
noticeable. That order can only be maintained through the use of nuclear
weapons, guided missiles, stealth bombers, weapons that can be launched from a
distance of </span><st1:metricconverter ProductID="5,000 kilometers"><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>5,000 kilometers</span></st1:metricconverter><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> and hit a baseball field, or the third
base of a baseball field, perhaps. That is what sustains that order, what
sustains that plunder, the attempts at taking possession of all the planet's
wealth, wherever it may be, not only by stripping the environment of this
wealth, as is being done in Alaska, where there may be no ice one day, just as
we may live to see the day when Antarctica is no longer covered by ice and
millions of square kilometers of water melt burying many islands. We may have
to set up a small pier nearby, provisionally, for when the water melts. Those
who have been there know that the ice is melting rapidly, they know this,
that's a fact. Just as the icecap over </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

style='font-family:Arial'> is melting: this is neither fiction nor a tall tale.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Nature
is being stripped of its balance and nations are being stripped of their
natural resources, their energy resources in the first place. And this order
can only be maintained through the use of weapons, but weapons are becoming
less and less effective as people grow in awareness and thanks to that
extraordinary capacity human beings have: the ability to think, to reflect, to
adapt to the concrete conditions of any given moment in history. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>You,
Russians, what did you do when the Nazis invaded and when their armored columns
were penetrating deep into Russian territory? The Russians did not surrender,
they fought back, they struggled to rejoin their armies, or they fought in the
jungles. Their attitude was not one of: &quot;I surrender&quot;. I stress this
again. They adapted, they went to </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
 style='font-family:Arial'>Siberia</span></st1:place><span lang=EN-US

 style='font-family:Arial'>Siberia</span></st1:place><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>, which worked, chilled by snowfall, to produce
weapons, at a time when the country's industrial region had been occupied and
devastated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>You
had to redeploy; you redeployed as much as you had to, until you struck a

those historical events. We have faced danger, true, but we have never been surprised

ground. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

can assure you that no one can occupy this country. I hope we're never put in
the position of having to demonstrate this, because we are well aware of the
costs. But, let me underscore this, this city cannot be occupied. This is a
city of hundreds of thousands of combatants who know how to defend it, where
there is not one illiterate person. Allow me to stress this: the lowest level
of schooling anyone has here is ninth grade; everyone knows how to handle a
mortar, a cannon or any similar weapon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Iraqi soldiers who fought in Fallujah, who held their ground against tanks and

weapons in the country and we will continue to arm ourselves. We have
accumulated so many weapons that I believe the island has sunk half an inch in
recent years because of the number of tanks, cannons and weapons of all kinds
that have reached our country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

potential invader knows that it will meet with a people determined to fight and
defend their homeland here. That is much more powerful than a nuclear weapon,
than 1,000 chemical weapons. What need do we have of nuclear weapons? Being a small
country, we have never entertained such a ridiculous idea which would spell our
ruin, having a weapon that would be useful only to commit suicide. How would we
transport it? We won't be playing that silly game which plays into the hands of
imperialism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

they met yesterday for a public debate, and the President of Spain was present.
Then, the President of our neighbor to the North, I believe, made a

matter, that mental stability does not matter, that mental health is of no

as a matter of fact, we were conversing with a man who said to us: &quot;My
wife was extremely happy, very happy, she went to such and such a hospital”
—she went for a check-up— &quot;she went for a check-up because they told her
she might be at risk of developing glaucoma&quot;. &quot;And what did they tell
her, did they examine her?” He said: “There's no danger, but, should one arise,
it would suffice to operate using a laser beam which would give you a lifetime
guarantee that you will never suffer from glaucoma&quot;. Just like that, with
those words, that is the importance of an early diagnosis. You don't get
diagnosed and then it's too late. You could have a sunspot, associated to age,
a growing spot in your eye which be treated with laser surgery. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>By
the end of this year, our country will have the capacity to operate on no less
than 5,000 or 6,000 patients a day, in 24 centers that are already fully fitted
with the most modern equipment. We are still in the training phase. If a
blockaded country like </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> can do this, why can't other countries?
This is the question that must be asked. Because millions go blind and no one
cares for them. Whoever goes blind in Cuba has at least the care afforded them
by social security, and that is a matter I am going to discuss tonight at 9:00
with the Council of State, the Council of Ministers, the Party leadership, the
country's leadership, grassroots organizations, the National Assembly
commissions, tomorrow's discussion, in which we will tackle the issue of low
pensions, in which we will raise the pensions of 1,800,000 people, who received
the lowest ones. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Some
days ago, we revalued our currency and devalued the dollar in our country. Yes,
because of the extreme privileges it enjoyed. I will give you one example, if
you wish, to summarize this point. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>You
know that electricity is indispensable and that a kilowatt is equivalent to
1,000 watts —I am sure you know this, most of you know this, because you pay an
electricity bill. Generating a kilowatt of electricity costs no less than 10
cents today. The fuel needed to generate one kilowatt costs 9 cents. Well,
because of the devaluation of currencies, because of this phenomenon, with one
dollar you could, till recently, purchase 27 pesos. When, three weeks ago, we
revalued our peso by 7 %, this ratio dropped to 1 to 25. This took place two
weeks ago, this measure involving the peso. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
week ago, it will be a week tomorrow, we revalued the convertible peso, and
because the convertible peso is governed by an exchange rate, the Cuban peso
was again revalued by 8%, for a total of 15%. With this stronger peso, tomorrow
we are going to raise the retirement payments of all pensioners who receive
less than 300 pesos, by categories: those who receive the least will get the
highest raise. We are talking about generations of workers who have suffered
the rigors of the blockade, who have endured many sacrifices. Yes, salaries
were raised, but pensions remained the same, there were no resources to raise
them. We are going to have a look at the lowest salaries as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> are not left to their own fate. They who
have an accident, who are incapacitated, who were born with a disability or
developed it later, because, sometimes, one is born with a given proclivity and
later suffers a full-blown disability, all receive aid. And they will not only
continue to receive it, they will receive more and more of it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Tomorrow,
there will be a total raise in pensions of more than 80%, starting tomorrow,
thanks to a revalued currency that will continue to gain in value. At least
it's something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

other places, people go blind and, what state looks after them, what
organization? Only charity organizations run by churches. How many blind people
wander the streets, how many blind or disabled children are out there cleaning
windshields or begging on the streets?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
challenge anyone to try and find, in our country, children who are not at
school, who are begging on the streets instead of at school. We have suffered
poverty, and we faced harder times, yes. There were irresponsible parents who
sent their children to ask tourists for money. These things will happen less
and less, because we have calculated everything mathematically, goods, prices,
costs, international costs, incomes, pensions, the needs of citizens. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

today, the United States government would like to destroy the small opening
towards Cuba that was produced when sales of foodstuffs were authorized by a
law passed in Congress, where the majority of senators and representatives
asked for an end to the blockade, and that law which had wider aspirations was
sabotaged, it was overloaded with amendments, a procedure they use whenever
they want. They tie an amendment to a fundamental law which must be passed and
all the representatives see themselves forced into a vote; but the majority is

our country more than 95% of the people vote, and there is no advertising, no

water, because if he is going to get it from water, we are surely going to send
him our congratulations, even I would congratulate him warmly if he were to get
energy from water, and I would be willing to propose his name for a Nobel

wanted to get hydrogen from water; they worked for something like 30 years and

comes from oil, it doesn’t come out of steel or iron, everything comes from
oil, there isn’t anything that doesn’t come from oil, I think even we come from

the core of the problem.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We are going to
make a modest contribution to the world by simply saving perhaps 50% of
electrical energy that is being consumed, saving some hundreds of millions of
dollars in energy, and part of this is going to be converted into those
programs that I was telling you about, and part will go into highly beneficial,
and I might add highly profitable investments. And we shall continue working on
education, a raw material which is called education and knowledge; and a raw
material of great value that is called “human capital”. It is human capital

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

should be truthful, I was already a Marxist-Leninist when I began the armed

nobody should be amazed at that. I am not dogmatic, I analyze peoples’ merits
in history, I never renounce my ideas, and I am capable of being critical; but
I have nothing to criticize to either Marx or Lenin, I say this honestly –I
could make other criticisms– nor can I criticize Engels, he was the first one
to show me that even the stars will go out when energy runs out, and there are
stars which stopped shining long ago, while there are others moving further

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

around to see when there was a certain balance; first they had nuclear weapons,
then there was a balance, and then both sides would manufacture more weapons.
Then the difference consisted in that one could destroy the other fifteen times

one side could destroy the other.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You,
the Russians, ceased being a superpower, however, everyone knows that each side

to ask again, because I really still cannot believe it; but he was praising
Kirchner to attack Chávez. He was attacking yesterday’s meeting which he really
didn’t like much.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course, they are
not going to neutralize Kirchner with flattery, or any such thing, because
Kirchner has just given them a “jab”; more than a “jab”, a hard punch; he

sum total of problems won’t let this state of affairs last even two decades.<span

I never lived the bourgeois lifestyle in some aristocratic neighborhood where I

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Commander.- </b>In my heart of hearts and
in the most profound of my convictions, I repudiate the deaths of innocents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I remember
the combats during the war in the Sierra Maestra; there were combats and
sometimes there were people who came to us with all the information –our
comrades who had relatives living close to the objectives– we were attacking
towns occupied by the army, and we took many of them, some of these were
difficult combats and I cannot recall one single dead civilian. See how even in
wartime and whenever you have to fight, because a garrison is in one location
and you have to attack it, even though it is preferable to have them come out,
because they are weaker on the move than when they are ensconced in their positions,
it is possible to avoid the deaths of innocent people.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I cannot recall one single civilian death in
any of the combats during the 25 months of war that we were engaged in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>I had a
contingent from which all the others derived, and our people learned to fight
by fighting; they didn’t learn it in academies since there were no academies at
that time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>These are
not just my words that I am saying here today; there is a long history that

child…I just can’t do it. We have an ethic, we have principles.<span

like, but you cannot sacrifice the life of an innocent person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>That is
what I believe and I have always said it, and our country has participated in
internationalist missions –not just one, but quite a few–when the South African
racists invaded Angola; or when the Mobuto forces invaded it from the north
–surely he was backed by lots of money, without anyone knowing where it was
being kept, or which bank was dealing with it– and not just there, in more than
one place we have been carrying out missions. You can make inquiries in the
world whether any of our prisoners of war were executed, in any of the places
where our troops were stationed and where our comrades died. It was a doctrine
and it was respected not just here; because our army never shot a prisoner of
war.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For us, this is a point of pride.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We will give you all that we have and anything
we can borrow if anyone can prove that in our war against apartheid and the
other allies of imperialism in Africa we ever executed any prisoner. Often
times, the soldiers of apartheid even preferred to become our prisoners because
their lives would be respected.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I say no
more (Applause).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

an excellent meeting of the Russia Cuba Collaboration Committee, with very good
results, at a peak time for relations between our peoples, and when there is a
basis of immense affection, affection expressed by the poet, the affection I
would express when I remember on Lake Baikal, in the middle of the snow, some
rough fishermen, strong men from Siberia, were roasting a fish, and we were
still having some problems in our relations, a certain dislike for the
incorrect manner, in our opinion, of having done something in the past, the way
the Missile Crisis had been resolved. I was able to get to know the Russian
people, and I can say that they are a very peace loving people, and more so
because they were people who lived through a war.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>No other
people suffered as much or were more devastated than the Russians during World
War II.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That people truly knew war and
the tragedy of war, and for that reason loved peace more than any other people;
but I can also say that the Russian people are a very unselfish people. That
man who had lived through war was able to give everything and return to
combat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That Siberian knew I was a
citizen of a little island and that I was there at the ends of the earth and he
talked to me and told me his feelings; because that was a people who, having
lived through a war and hating war more than anyone else, had the generosity of
spirit to die for another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>We Cubans
also learned about this. Not only have we given our lives for our homeland and
for our soil, many Cubans have given their lives fighting or offering their
services on internationalist missions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I was
really amazed by my experiences at age 21. I could tell you that a short time
later, when I was in Bogotá, during an OAS meeting, an important leader was assassinated
and I watched the entire city explode. I enlisted there with the people, with
the students, grabbing a gun just like them, and I took up position in a police
station, armed. I think I had but seven bullets, a cap with no visor looking
like a beret and a pair shoes not specially fit for combat. I was in that city
until the last day; they almost had to throw me out. There was even a
negotiation and peace and they left everybody high and dry there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I’m not inventing this, there are written
accounts of all this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>And I had
an instant of doubt one night, in the early morning at around 2:00 or 3:00. We
were in the police station; it was a rebel police station. Because of the way
violence erupted, and the looting and all that, even the army didn’t know what
to do. At that time, Gaitán was a much loved leader. He was defending a
lieutenant from some kind of slander and everyone listened to him. But the
looting led to martial law; and I was on the side of the rebels, on the side of
the students, the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The people
destroyed and looted because their level of education left them no other
option; they looked like ants carrying pianos, fridges measuring two cubic
meters. I saw all that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those men holed
up in the police station, rebels, were lost. I was aware of that because of our
history, because I had been thinking, I had meditated on many things like that,
in spite of my tender years, and there I was with the lost garrison, where a
tank would rumble by and fire some shots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I saw
there how they were abusing a policeman, and I was outraged; he was a “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>godo</i>”, that’s what they called a
reactionary, and they mistreated him there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I was in one of the dormitories standing at the window, because that was
the position they assigned me, and I was upset; they mistreated him, insulted
him and told him all sorts of things. I spoke two or three times with the
leader and said: &quot;Look, these troops are lost.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Anyone who
has read books about the French Revolution knows what violent protests are
like, knows that troops who stay put are lost; any troops in that situation
must take the initiative. That’s what happened during the French Revolution. We
have read about it in books by many different authors…Anyone staying put in a
place is lost.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told him: “Take the men
out on the street, attack.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was trying
to persuade him but he didn’t understand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Well, there I was, and in a given moment I remembered my family, I even
remembered my girlfriend. I remembered everything. So, I had an instant of
doubt. Nobody knew I was there; I was going to die there, without a face or a
name, and I had to explain to myself why I was still there. And I explained it
to myself right away, saying to myself: this people is just like all the
others, like mine, their cause is just, the injustice is the same as it is over
there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I knew I was right, my
inconformity came from the fact that the men were being poorly used.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Should I sacrifice myself or not? And what did I decide? To stay, to
sacrifice myself along with all those people. I was lucky that we were not
attacked, the other side had tanks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>          </span>The
next day, I said to him: “Give me a patrol”; all the high points were
unoccupied and all the armed forces had to do was show up and take the high
points.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I said: “Give me a patrol”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>And they gave me a patrol and I went up to
defend the heights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>It was a
tremendous experience for me; that day I watched the city burn, and in the
evening I returned, and I didn’t make use of that as an excuse to save my life;
I returned to the garrison because they told me the station was being attacked;
thankfully the rebels were attacking a building somewhere else.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And so, by pure chance, I survived, I stayed
there and the next day they didn’t even let me take away a little sword that I
wanted as a souvenir; peace had been declared and everyone was applauding: “The
Cuban!”, everyone was talking to the Cuban, because everyone was amazed that a
Cuban student had stayed there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I was
there for a congress we were organizing, and I enlisted, and I had my doubts
that day. This story I’m telling you, I’ve never told it before, because it was
a matter of conscience; I stayed and I decided to sacrifice myself for a people
that was not my own, in an operation that was a lost cause, in a group of men
who were defeated, and I stayed there because it was a matter of conscience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I say that
it was very recent, because it was just at the time I was going from the second
to the third year of university; I already had many ideas, I was an
anti-imperialist or anti-colonialist. I was in favor of Dominican democracy,
the independence of Puerto Rico, the return of the Panama Canal to the
Panamanians, the Falklands to the Argentines, the end of European colonies in
Latin America, those were the banners.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Well, it wasn’t a Socialist banner, yet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I had not
yet read Marx at that time I’m telling you about. I have just told you about
two episodes. But observe how my thinking goes, so, I really say what I am
thinking, and it isn’t an answer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can
answer any question you ask me because I have tried to be consistent in my
ideas, to maintain a steadfast position, and so, “be steadfast”, that is what I
would advise any young person. And like all young people, I must have had my
measure of vanity; it is not what I should have, but surely I had. I have had
it all, even petit bourgeois vanities, pride, those sorts of silly things; but
I never abandoned my set of values, and life has taught me to be more modest,
more self-effacing. I think I am more humble now than when I began as a young
man. A youth is very critical of everyone else, he thinks he knows it all and
that he is right, but he is not always right; and, of course, I always remember
the way I was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Life is a
constant struggle right up to the very end, and I think I shall be fighting
against myself until the day I die, on the exact second I die, because I am
still analyzing whatever I do, I analyze myself and whenever I make a mistake,
no matter how small, if it is a detail, I correct it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Who knows whether I will start thinking later
about what I have just said here; but I hope not, because I have been true in
telling you, as I appreciate your meeting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I am not going to make a speech here, I have not had time, because I am
involved in all of this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have had
little information, just minimal. I could barely eat lunch because I was
reading, looking into other things, dashing to meet with the minister,
returning, and there were people waiting for me there. Tomorrow I make an
important appearance at 6:00 p.m. and supposedly I am still recuperating from
an accident I had on October 20 last year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I’m telling you that perhaps I will make a soul searching, and say: What did I
tell the Russians?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But I am sure that I
won’t be sorry about anything I have told you, because I have spoken with you
like a brother, I have spoken with you affectionately, I have spoken to you
from my heart.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, whatever we feel for
you, because just like I was saying to you, I met men like those, I met forest
rangers, I met true patriotic and revolutionary Russians, like the combatants I
always saw, those who fought in Stalingrad, in Leningrad, in Kiev, all over, in
Smolensk, the ones who never surrendered, those that continued the resistance,
those that fought.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yes, those who went
to fight the Japanese, when without saying anything to anyone the United States
dropped that famous bomb, in an act of terror.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

to calculate what the Allies lost, the Russians and all the Soviet peoples who
fought alongside Russia sacrificed more lives than all the allies who
participated in that war; it’s the truth. I have visited some cemeteries, the
one in Leningrad, and I know history, the 1,000 day siege. I have also read a
huge book that commemorates all the sacrifices made in Leningrad, like the ones
made by the Russian people everywhere.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>When will
they really go? When they can; they will withdraw whenever they can
withdraw.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s just that now they can
neither leave, nor can they stay, they are part of the game about what if the
Shiites this, what if the Sunnis that, what if there is a government; they’ll
leave when they can, because invaders do not leave when they want, they leave
when they can do so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They know the
moment they can invade, but they don’t know when they can pull out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

afterwards it cost them a lot of effort, a lot of time and 50,000 lives lost;
the tally of lives permitted them by American society at that time was
50,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wonder whether American
society today would allow a tally of 5,000 lives to the invaders.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Perhaps 5,000 lives is already the maximum
that will be tolerated, and as time goes by, the tally for adventures based on
lies and deception will be less.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The
problem is that they already need to pull out, but they can’t.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

question is: When can they withdraw? That will ultimately depend on the
American people and on the economic crisis and the almost 500 billion budgetary

can they put up with this trillion dollar deficit and how are they going to get
out of it?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do they think they will

religious contradictions, national contradictions, a complicated situation;
Kurds to the north, Sunnis in the center, Shiites to the south, Orthodox

how many doctors you need.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We can draw
up a plan so that they won’t die.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
was true that children were dying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Here we
have had a Special Period, a blockade, an endless list of things, but children
have not died; first the adults die, the parents die before the children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Thus, my
position to them was: “We cannot justify it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Why don’t you finally declare peace with </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Kuwait</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>?” I asked them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was telling the Iraqi representatives who
attended the meeting: “Work for peace.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>There were
even a lot of people, some of the Arab countries which were at war, who wanted
to correct the error, who wanted to seek peace, and they kept on maintaining an
unyielding position. In </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Malaysia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> I told the Vice President: “The U.S.
government wants to wage war against you, it is obvious that they are going to
war, they cannot hide it; don't give them the least excuse, don't help them go
to war.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told them: &quot;Look,
don't start thinking now if they say that those missiles have </span><st1:metricconverter

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> more and if they cannot pass 500, limit
them to 499. Your rights are undeniable, but don't give them any excuse.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Explain, state it publicly, and invite a
Non-aligned Commission to visit </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Iraq</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> in order to show them that there are no
chemical weapons.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told them: “I think
you don’t have any, and if you ever manufactured some, destroy them.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I asked him to communicate this to the Iraqi
leadership.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was clear that the
launching of the attack was quite imminent; but I took the initiative and told
the Vice President, and he even thanked me profusely. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>On the other occasion, the Kuwaiti
incident, the Iraqi government had stated:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>“The Mother of all Wars is going to take place.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This and this are going to happen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s not </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> any more.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Vietnam had support, the jungle, not the deserts, an irregular kind of
warfare, the support of China which was next door, of the Soviet Union which
was sending weapons by sea, by many different ways.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You are not going to receive a single bullet,
you have nowhere to turn to in the midst of this situation,” I told them. I
said all this while I was asking them to correct their errors and not help the
empire.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Time has gone by and now their
country is occupied.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seemed to them
to be simple enough and now they have a very serious headache, they have been
shattered; they have been loosing their strength.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many Americans are realizing this and,
surely, it is not the same now as when they had just arrived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Many
people there are thinking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is not a
matter of pulling a trigger or pushing a button. In order to push a button, you
have to have something like 200 or 300; I don’t know how many people decide
upon pressing a button. The soldiers themselves know, they are professionals,
and they know the toll this will take in lives, in prestige.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It has been a tremendous discredit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even I have been surprised by the events.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Imagine
how naive we are that even knowing exactly what they are like, that they have
absolutely no scruples, I would never have thought the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> government would torture prisoners.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I thought that they would not be doing that,
that they wouldn’t be so foolish as to do that; carrying out those sadistic physical
and psychological tortures, just for the sake of it. It is shameful, sickening;
it didn’t happen in just one place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>I would
never have imagined that one day the Guantanamo Naval Base, a piece of Cuban
territory occupied by force, would be a torture center, of all sorts of
sadistic tortures.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could never have
imagined it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I really didn’t think…I
believed that that uncivilized civilization, that government which was capable
of dropping nuclear weapons, bombing everything, would not commit the
foolishness of taking human beings, whoever they might be.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Have we never dealt with criminals who have
murdered our comrades?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whoever they
might be, we never laid a finger on them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We can give all the money in the country –there is not a lot, but there
is some– to whoever can prove that here we have ever laid a finger on any of
the most despicable prisoners, on the perpetrator of any of the worst crimes or
on the worst acts of terror against our country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>We had
prisoners, those taken at Giron, after the attack by the </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Bay of Pigs</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, mercenaries who invaded us, those who
had come and landed preceded by air raids, who had killed women and children.
There, after that battle, which was bitter, fought for 68 hours straight; we
didn’t let up day or night because the American Marines squad was waiting to
land.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I don’t know what those that
heard about it are saying; you are hearing this from someone who was there,
because, among other things, that has been my habit all my life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have never been holed up in some shelter,
that’s not my way, not my way of thinking, not my habit. I was there at dawn
when the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Marines simulated a landing on the northern part of Pinar del Río
province, close to the capital.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
said,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“But what do you mean a landing?”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Yes, a landing.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Positive information on a landing at
Cabañas,” exactly as they had told me 24 hours earlier when they woke me up: a
landing on Playa Larga, and that a squad there had clashed with the enemy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Later,
after the paratrooper had been dropped, I was totally convinced that that was
the main attack.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were there, they had
rejected our tank attack, and we were preparing another from a different
direction. We were going to surprise them in the rearguard, on Playa Larga and
at Girón, at both locations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There I was
awaiting a tank battalion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was our
artillery shelling them hard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe we
would have arrived at Girón before dawn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Yankees maneuvered; today's highway did not even exist then. We had
poor communications, organized at the level of battalions, not by army or even
by corps or divisions or even brigades.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When we were guerrillas we didn’t have battalions, no tank, artillery or
anti-aircraft battalions, or 130 mortar battalions, or howitzer 122 battalions.
It was on the level of batteries, but in the mountains we had none of that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>So we were
facing the American squad and nobody was executed, nobody hit over the head
with a rifle butt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What did that
prove?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That ideas had turned into
conscience, that ethics were conscience, and those soldiers who were angry were
not abusing anyone. The American squad was 3 miles away, not 12.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we entered the Girón area they were
there with their lights off; aircraft carriers, Marine infantry in boats,
waiting to set up a government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>That’s
what I want to say; I know these people well, but<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could not imagine that they were capable of
torturing prisoners, not at </span><st1:City><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Guantanamo</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, not at Abu Ghraib.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I thought they were a little sane, sane
enough not to do that, and I said why.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They cannot justify it in hatred or anger, and that is why I mentioned
to you that many times we have imprisoned terrorists, mercenaries, traitors and
we have never laid a finger on them, and they have done it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Therefore,
that’s what I tell you, they will withdraw when they can, when the moral and
political price will be as little as possible; but no-one knows. Perhaps one
day the American people will decide that they have to withdraw from that
country, no matter who is President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
