<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

</span>This time the subject is quite a bit more complicated and hard to
believe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Almost four decades ago
scientists living in the United States created the Internet, the same way that
Albert Einstein, born in Germany, discovered in his own time the formula to
measure atomic energy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Einstein was
a great scientist and humanist.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
contradicted </span><st1:City><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:

Arial'>’s laws of physics, held sacred until then.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, apples continued to fall due to the
laws of gravity that had been defined by </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Newton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>These were two different ways of observing and interpreting nature, with
very little information on this in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Newton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>’s day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I remember what I read more than 50 years ago about the famous theory of
relativity elaborated by Einstein: energy is equal to mass times the speed of
light, called C, squared: E=MC2.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> money existed and the resources necessary
for such expensive research.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
political climate resulting from the generalized hatred against the brutalities
of Nazism in the richest and most productive nation in the world destroyed by
the war, transformed that fabulous energy into bombs that were dropped over the
defenseless populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, causing hundreds of
thousands of deaths and a similar number of people who were exposed to
radiation and subsequently died in the following years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>A clear
example of the use of science and technology with the same hegemonic goals is
described in an article written by the former official of United States National
Security, Gus W. Weiss; it originally appeared in the magazine <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Studies in Intelligence</i>, in 1996, even
though it was more widely distributed in 2002 under the title of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Deceiving the Soviets.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></i>There, Weiss claims it was his idea to
send to the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>USSR</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> software that they needed for their
industries, but already contaminated, with the aim of making that country’s
economy collapse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>According
to notes taken from Chapter 17 of the book <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>At
the Abyss: An Insider’s History of the Cold War, </i>by Thomas C. Reed, former
Secretary of the United States Air Force, Leonid Brezhnev told a group of senior
Party officials in 1972: “We Communists have to string along with the
capitalists for a while.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We need their
credits, their agriculture and their technology.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we are going to continue massive military
programs, and by the mid-1980s we will be in a position to return to an
aggressive foreign policy designed to gain the upper hand with the West.” This
information was confirmed by the Defense Department in hearings before the
House Committee on Banking and Currency in 1974.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>In the
early 1970s Nixon’s administration advanced the idea of détente.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Henry Kissinger hoped that “over time, trade
and investment may leaven the autarkic tendencies of the Soviet system”, he
considered that détente might “invite gradual association of the Soviet economy
with the world economy, and foster a degree of interdependence that adds an element
of stability to the political relations”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Reagan
tended to ignore Kissinger’s theories about détente and to take President
Brezhnev’s word, but all doubts were removed on </span><st1:date Month="7"
Day="19" Year="1981"><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>July 19, 1981</span></st1:date><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> when the new U.S. President met with
President Francois Mitterrand, of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>France</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, at the economic G-7 summit in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Ottawa</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In a conversation off to the side, Mitterrand informed Reagan about the
success his intelligence services had had in recruiting a KGB agent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The man worked in a section that evaluated
the achievements of Soviet efforts to acquire western technology.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Reagan expressed great interest in Mitterrand’s
delicate revelations and also thanked him for his offer to have the material
sent to the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The
dossier, under the name of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Farewell, </i>reached
the CIA in August 1981.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It made it quite
clear that the Soviets had been spending years on research and development
activities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Given the enormous transfer
of technology by radar, computers, machine-tools and semi-conductors from the
United States to the Soviet Union, one could say that the Pentagon was in an
arms race with itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Farewell Dossier </i>also identified
hundreds of case officials, agents at their posts and other suppliers of
information through the West and </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>During the first years of détente, the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> and the </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> had established working groups in
agriculture, civil aviation, nuclear energy, oceanography, computers and the
environment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The aim was to start
building &quot;bridges of peace&quot; between the superpowers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The members of the working groups had to
exchange visits to their centers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Besides
identifying agents, the most useful information brought by the Dossier consisted
of the “shopping list” and its aims in terms of acquisition of technology in
the coming years. When the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Farewell
Dossier </i>reached </span><st1:State><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, Reagan asked Bill Casey, the CIA
Director, to come up with a secret operative use for the material.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The production
and transportation of oil and gas was one of the Soviet priorities. A new
trans-Siberian gas pipeline was to carry natural gas from the gas fields of Urengoi
in </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Siberia</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, through </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Kazakhstan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Russia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> and </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
 style='font-family:Arial'>Eastern Europe</span></st1:place><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'> towards the western dollar markets. In order to
automate the operation of valves, compressors and storage installations of such
an immense enterprise, the Soviets needed sophisticated control systems. They
bought some of the first computers on the open market, but when the authorities
of the gas pipeline took off for the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> to buy the necessary software, they were
turned down. Undaunted, the Soviets searched elsewhere; a KGB operative was
sent to penetrate a Canadian software supplier in an attempt to acquire the
necessary codes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> intelligence, warned by the agent in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Farewell Dossier, </i>responded and manipulated
the software before delivery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Once in
the </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, computers and software worked in unison
and they made the gas pipeline work splendidly. But this tranquility was misleading.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Inside the software that operated the gas
pipeline, there was a Trojan horse, a term used to describe software lines
hidden in the normal operative system which make that system lose control in
the future, or whenever it would receive an order from abroad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In order
to affect the dollar revenues coming in from the West and the domestic Russian
economy, the software for the gas pipeline which was to operate the pumps,
turbines and valves had been programmed to breakdown after a prudent interval
and reset –that’s how it was described– the speeds of the pumps and the valve
adjustments so that they would work at pressures much higher than those
suitable for the pipeline’s gaskets and welding seams.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“The
result was the most monumental non-nuclear explosion and fire ever seen from
space. At the White House, we received warning from our infrared satellites of
some bizarre event out in the middle of Soviet nowhere. NORAD (North American
Aerospace Defense Command) feared a missile liftoff from a place where no
rockets were known to be based. Or perhaps it was the detonation of a small
nuclear device…They (the satellites) had detected no electromagnetic pulse,
characteristic of nuclear detonations. Before these conflicting indicators
could turn into an international crisis, Gus Weiss came down the hall to tell
his fellow NSC staffers not to worry”, affirmed Thomas C. Reed in his book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The
campaign of countermeasures based on the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Farewell
Dossier </i>was economic warfare.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even
though there were no casualties in terms of lives lost from the gas pipeline
explosion, significant damage was made to the Soviet economy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>As a grand
finale, between 1984 and 1985, the United States and its NATO allies put an end
to this operation which ended with efficacy the capacity of the USSR to capture
technology at a time when Moscow was caught between a defective economy, on one
side, and a US President determined to prevail and end the cold war on the
other.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In the
above cited article by Weiss, it is stated that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>“In 1985, the case took a bizarre turn when
information on the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Farewell Dossier</i>
surfaced in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>France</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>. Mitterrand came to suspect that Vetrov
had all along been a CIA plant set up to test him to see if the material would
be handed over to the Americans or kept by the French.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Acting on this mistaken belief, Mitterrand
fired the chief of the French service, Yves Bonnet.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

age of 72. The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Washington Post</i> did
not report his death until December 7, that is, 12 days later.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They said that Weiss “had fallen” from his

program.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Looking back, it is now clear
to me that Ronald Reagan’s original decision on SDI was the single most
important of his presidency”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“In
formulating our approach to SDI, there were four distinct elements which I bore
in mind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first was the science
itself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The American aim in SDI was to
develop a new and much more effective defense against ballistic missiles.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“This
concept of defense rested on the ability to attack incoming ballistic missiles
at all stages of their flight, from the boost phase when the missile and all
its warheads and decoys were together –the best moment– right up to the point
of re-entry of the earth’s atmosphere on its way to the target.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“The
second element to be considered was the existing international agreements
limiting the deployment of weapons in space and ABM systems.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The 1972 ABM Treaty, as amended by a 1974
Protocol, allowed the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

to one hundred launchers in defense either of either an Inter-Continental
Ballistic Missile (ICBM) silo field or the national capital.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“The
Foreign Office of the Ministry of Defense always sought to urge the narrowest
possible interpretation, which the Americans --rightly in my view-- believed
would have meant that SDI was stillborn. I always tried to steer away from this
phraseology and made it clear in private and public that research on whether a
system was viable could not be said to have been completed until it had been
successfully tested. Underneath the jargon, this apparently technical point was
really a matter of straight common sense. But it was to become the issue
dividing the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“The third
element in the calculation was the relative strength of the two sides in
Ballistic Missile Defense. Only the </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
 style='font-family:Arial'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'> possessed a working ABM system (known as GALOSH)

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

Soviets were further advanced in anti-satellite weapons. There was, therefore,
a strong argument that the Soviets had already acquired an unacceptable
advantage in this whole area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“The
fourth element was the implications of SDI for deterrence. I started off with a
good deal of sympathy for the thinking behind the ABM Treaty. This was the most
sophisticated and effective the defense against nuclear missiles, the greater
the pressure to seek hugely expensive advances in nuclear weapons technology. I
was always a believer in a slightly qualified version of the doctrine known as
MAD- ’mutually assured destruction’. The threat of (what I preferred to call)
‘unacceptable destruction' which would follow from a nuclear exchange was such
that nuclear weapons were an effective deterrent against not just nuclear but
also conventional war.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“But I
soon began to see that SDI would strengthen not weaken the nuclear deterrent.
Unlike President Reagan and some other members of his Administration I never
believed that SDI could offer one hundred percent protection, but it would
allow sufficient </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US

talks with Mr. Gorbachev. This was the first occasion on which I had heard
President Reagan speaking about SDI. He did so with passion. He was at his most

  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

that if SDI succeeded he would be ready to internationalize it so that it was
at the service of all countries, and that he told Mr. Gromyko as much. He
reaffirmed his long-term goal of getting rid of nuclear weapons entirely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

heard, now that we got down to discussion of the likely reality rather than the
grand vision, was reassuring. President Reagan did not pretend that they yet

  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

taking account of Soviet developments; (2) SDI-related deployment would, in
view of treaty obligations, have to be a matter for negotiation; (3) the
overall aim is to enhance, not undercut, deterrence; (4) East-West negotiation
should aim to achieve security with reduced levels of offensive systems on both

different technique to speaking from notes.) In fact, I borrowed President

jetlag, I practised until </span><st1:time Hour="4" Minute="0"><st1:metricconverter

following month (March 1985) saw the death of Mr. Chernenko and, with remarkably

even colder than at Yuri Andropov’s. Mr. Gorbachev had a large number of
foreign dignitaries to see. But I had almost an hour's talk with him that
evening in St. Katherine’s Hall in the Kremlin. The atmosphere was more formal
than at Chequers (the official country residence of British prime ministers

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>. Not much of substance came out of it --the
Soviets insisted on linking cuts in strategic nuclear weapons to an end to SDI
research-- but a good personal rapport quickly developed between the two
leaders. A certain concern had been raised that the young and bright Soviet
leader might be cleverer than President Reagan. But he was not, which I found
not at all surprising for Ronald Reagan had had plenty of practise in his early
years as President of the Screen Actors Guild in union negotiations on
realistic basis, and no one was more realistic than Mr. Gorbachev.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“During
1986 Mr. Gorbachev showed great subtlety in playing on western public opinion
by bringing forward tempting, but unacceptable, proposals on arms control.
Relatively little was said by the Soviets on the link between SDI and cuts in
nuclear weapons. But they were given no reasons to believe that the Americans
were prepared to suspend or stop SDI research. Late in the year it was agreed
that President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev- with their Foreign Ministers- should
meet in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Reykjavik</span></st1:City><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

that you could not ultimately hold back research on SDI any more than you could
prevent research into new kinds of offensive weapons. We had to be the first to
get it. Science is unstoppable; it will not be stopped for being ignored. “<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial'> summit on that weekend of 11 and 12 October (1986) can
be seen to have a quite different significance than most of the commentators at
the time realized. A trap had been prepared for the Americans. Ever greater
Soviet concessions were made during the summit: they agreed for the first time
that the British and French deterrents should be excluded from the INF
negotiations; an that cuts in strategic nuclear weapons should leave each side
with equal numbers- rather than a straight percentage cut, which would have led
the Soviets well ahead. They also made significant concessions on INF numbers.
As the summit drew to an end President Reagan was proposing an agreement by
which the whole arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons- bombers, long-range
Cruise and ballistic missiles- would be halved within five years and the most
powerful of these weapons, strategic ballistic missiles, eliminated altogether
within ten. Mr. Gorbachev was even more ambitious: he wanted the elimination of
all strategic nuclear weapons by the end of the ten-year period.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
