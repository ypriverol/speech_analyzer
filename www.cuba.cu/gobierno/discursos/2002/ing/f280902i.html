been possible thanks to the determination, constructive spirit and initiative
of farmers and businesspeople in the United States and the modest but sincere
and friendly cooperation of the food importing, producing and distributing

mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Throughout more than a century, sugar, tobacco, rum,
vegetables, tropical fruits, nickel, cobalt, iron, copper and other commodities
were exchanged for U.S. food and industrial products. Our country’s beaches,
clean air, abundant vegetation, warm sunshine, beautiful landscapes, as well as
its popular music and other cultural manifestations together with our people’s
traditional hospitality were always attractions that millions of Americans
enjoyed in our country, regardless of historical circumstances. Not even major
international conflicts could interfere with our trade relations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

countries, when it comes to the exchange of products. What is really new is the
transcendental event that we celebrate here tonight:, a U.S. Food and
Agribusiness Exhibition in Cuba after more than 40 years of no trade at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>It is my duty here tonight to most sincerely
acknowledge the seriousness, efficiency and punctuality of the suppliers and
the quality of the products delivered. Not one of the merchant ships that
arrived in our country delayed even a minute in the time scheduled for
unloading, while all of the importers without exception were rewarded with
hundreds of thousands dollars for swift delivery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:

including transportation costs, had initially been estimated in 40 million USD,
were at the beginning of this exhibition 140 million and in the following days
new contracts have been signed that will eventually raise that figure to over
200 million USD.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

case of late payment for the services and products delivered; everything was
paid for in cash, despite predictions by those who claimed that Cuba was not in
a position to pay for such purchases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>On the other hand, such
operations have not affected the economic and financial interests of our
country’s traditional food suppliers during the hardest years of the special
period. Their interests have always been taken into account. The increase of
U.S. imports have been based on very precise analysis and calculations of the
comparative economic advantages of gains and losses in hard currency related to
local productions, and on indispensable import increases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

been nor will be affected since special circumstances enable us to fully
respect their income and to offer them the opportunity to follow middle or
higher level studies, which will extraordinarily raise their self-esteem and
social recognition. The country will thus have more funds available for its
economic and social development. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Over the last few
months, I have had the privilege of speaking with hundreds of farmers and
agribusiness representatives from the United States. I have learned a great
deal from them about the agricultural techniques applied and the productivity
achieved by grain farmers. Many of them are families with three or four members
who farm large areas of land and cultivate hundreds of hectares of grains by
using large and modern machinery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The question I
invariably ask almost all of them is how much more food they could produce
above and beyond their current production. What leads me to ask them this is my
deep conviction that the greatest challenge facing humanity in the
not-too-distant future will be food production. The world’s population today is
roughly 6.2 billion, four times more than 100 years ago and this figure will
almost be doubled in a few short decades. Only science, technology and higher
productivity per hectare will help face the enormous challenge on a planet that
is becoming increasingly impoverished and lacking in arable land and drinking
water with every passing year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>As peoples acquire higher levels of education and
development, they demand greater quantities of grains. They are not satisfied
with cereals, for example; they want also milk, meat, eggs, greater variety and
quality in the foods they eat, including more grains, fruit, vegetables, fiber
and vitamins, and less fat and heavy molecular weight oil.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In the near future
markets will not be scarce but food will. We must facilitate exchange,
eliminate obstacles, and increase trade and development so that billions of
undernourished people in the world will be able to buy what they need to live
and to achieve the necessary technical and economic development. When this is
achieved, then the hard-working American farmers will never again have to worry
about finding markets for the food that they are capable of producing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:

my comrades, this exhibition have meant a privilege since we have been able to
meet and to sustain fruitful exchanges with many farmers, food industry
business people and others in charge of agricultural programs coming from
almost every state of the Union. They are all excellent and well-educated
people in whom we appreciate the great values and human virtues that we have
always recognized in the American people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
