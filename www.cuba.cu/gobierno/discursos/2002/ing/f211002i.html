lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'> out of studying is being put into
practice for the first time. But that’s not the only thing happening here
today; at the same time a contingent of several thousand workers who have been
made redundant as a result of the restructuring of the sugar industry is
initiating an ambitious and grandiose program to retrain workers in that
industry. Those are two things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Now,
to understand the significance of and need for restructuring we have to take a
quick look at history. I am sure that there will be no doubts remaining and
that at the same time as a measure of great use and importance to the economy
is taken a new and extremely promising phase in the sugar sector is being
launched.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
notice the almost total silence that there is at this ceremony among the 10 000
people gathered here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
said it was essential to look at the history of sugar production and the sugar
industry. It began more than 150 years ago. During the first half of the 19<sup>th</sup>
century, the country’s most important product and export was coffee. Tobacco
was too, for a short time. We only have to remember the first tobacco growers’
struggles in our history in Santiago de Las Vegas who rose up against what I
think was called the tobacco levy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
think that with the historical research that is being done now, knowledge about
this era will be within reach of our compatriots. Sugar, tobacco and coffee
were very important sources of income for the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
have read about two almost consecutive major hurricanes, category 4 or 5 hurricanes
with winds of over 300 kilometers, which occurred between 1844 and 1845 and
practically wiped out the coffee plantations in western Cuba. At that time
there were no coffee plantations on any mountain, nor in any mountain range,
those were virgin territory, rather, they were mostly in the region of what is
now the province of Havana. They actually extended as far east as Matanzas and
as far west as Cayajabos, where there are still some ruins of the French
farmers who, having left Haiti, came as far as those regions to settle. Of
course, the first place they settled was in what is now Guantánamo
province—very close to the island where Santo Domingo and Haiti are located—
after there had been a huge rebellion, almost at the beginning of that century,
of the hoards of slaves who worked there producing coffee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>When that French colony was almost the world’s only coffee
supplier, many of those coffee growers emigrated to the island of Cuba.
Sometimes they brought some of their slaves with them. However, what they
mostly brought was their experience and they found excellent conditions in that
province, so that in the 1868 war the patriots had to launch an offensive
against that province.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Of
course all of those oligarchs, slave owners and coffee producers supported the
colonial government so the battles were hard fought. Maximo Gómez led that
offensive and the Maceo brothers were there too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>History
tells of violent conflicts. Every coffee plantation became a quasi-fortress and
the coffee plantations extended as far as the area near Santiago de Cuba.
Around Gran Piedra there are still some ruins of those coffee plantations. We
visited them once and we admired how technically developed they were, the way
they used fertilizer, mostly lime, to create the ideal soil conditions for
coffee, the streams for washing the coffee, all those operations that machines
do today. They are still ruins there, near Santiago, and there are also ruins
around Cayajabos, as I said, in the mountainous region that borders on Pinar del
Río. But the big expansion of coffee production, in fact, occurred on the flat
and fertile lands of the province of Havana and naturally, all that development
was based on slave labor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
was when those natural phenomena more or less wiped out the coffee plantations
that sugar cane growing was given a boost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Previous
to this, Cuba had reached the position of being the world’s biggest coffee
producer and exporter in those years, but the owners of those coffee
plantations, the owners of those lands, pushed for sugar cane growing and Cuba
also became the biggest producer and exporter of sugar —I don’t remember any
other country [exporting sugar] back then. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Back
then there were around 300,000 slaves, the majority of whom, of course, were
employed in growing and processing sugar. From that time on a market for Cuban
sugar began to develop in the United States, but Cuba also supplied Spain,
Europe with sugar, although its major market began to be the U.S. market.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is why, when the blockade and the
cancellation of Cuba’s sugar quotas happened, after 1959, a market that took
more than a century to develop was destroyed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>It was at that time that the idea
that there is no Cuba without sugar was born, and that was true until very
recently. These big sugar mills capable of producing tens of thousands of tons
of sugar, and some more than one hundred thousand tons, didn’t exist then;
rather there were hundreds— I’m not sure but I think that between them, Havana
and Matanzas provinces had some 1000 small sugar mills. Steam wasn’t used yet,
animals were used to power the machines. However, throughout the second half of
that century advances were being made, and sugar mills were being created, some
of them larger and more modern. At that stage the use of machinery and of steam
was introduced, the capacity of the industry was growing and sugar production
was growing too. The Spanish colony made its living from it; it was one of
Spain’s biggest sources of income, income that came from its colonies. It had
lost all its other colonies on the continent but it called this colony the
jewel of the crown, mostly because of its sugar output.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
central idea of Maximo Gómez, Maceo and the most important leaders of the 68
war, the one called the Ten Years War, was to invade the west, because the war
began in an eastern area where they were many peasants or independent
producers, although some were big land owners too, along with the independent
peasants. The slave system had not taken root, except in Guantanamo, and that
was where the war started. There were some sugar mills; Carlos Manuel de
Céspedes owned one of them and the first thing he did, on that October 10,
1868, was to free the slaves. These were not slave provinces, I repeat, they
were rather provinces of farmers, cattle owners, although there was some sugar
in that region where that war began. In Camagüey, it was mostly cattle, there
was no significant sugar output but there was a lot of cattle ranching. Las
Villas already had a larger number of sugar mills, but it was mainly a farming
province. This is why the war that broke out in the east easily spread to
Camagüey, and to Las Villas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>They
tried to extend the invasion as far as was possible. The Mambises tried to get
as far as the zone that supported the Spanish colony, that supported the
Spanish army with its production and income. When the last War of Independence
began in 1895 — there had been a so-called Little War beforehand— Marti’s idea
was, obviously, to fight a lightning war which would begin everywhere at the
same time. But the struggle began anyway with Maceo’s landing in the Baracoa
region, and Marti’s near Playitas in what is now Guantánamo province in
difficult, precarious conditions when they lost their weapons, which every one
knows about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
was a big uprising in Oriente, which soon spread all over. From the very first
the idea was to invade the west, the strategy was to spread the war to the
whole country and, basically, to destroy the principal support of the Spanish
government, the main source of income for Spain’s colonial budget; most people
know that history. It is well known that the sugar mills were destroyed, cane
was burned. And that invasion got as far as Mantua, there was virtually no cane
field left anywhere on the island, not anywhere. You can see the influence that
sugar cane already had on the life of the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
that war ended with the U.S. intervention, reconstruction of the sugar industry
began. First the existing plantations were replanted and later the creation of
huge plantations began in the provinces in Oriente and Camagüey. Those who
intervened had the best, the ideal conditions for investing in that industry,
in that product which had been destroyed during the last war. And that is how
the industry was rebuilt, partly with Cuban capital but mostly with U.S.
capital, and sugar growing spread to virgin zones, we might say, from Camagüey
to Guantánamo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
fact, huge extensions of woodlands, of mahogany and other precious woods were
cut down and the precious wood used as fuel in the sugar mills. At that time
there was not even a market for that kind of wood, there was plenty of it in
this hemisphere and elsewhere. So sugar plantations and the huge estates which
surrounded Holguín were created, I spoke about them that day in Holguín in the
ceremony where there were 400,000 Holguinians present under a heavy downpour. I
was born near there, near Birán. But those huge estates were all over the
place, some were bigger than 100, 000 hectares, the United Fruit Company’s.
Other companies even managed to own up to 200,000 hectares of sugar cane
fields. The labor force was not big enough and big immigrations from other
Caribbean islands began. Tens and tens of thousand of Caribbean islanders,
mostly Haitians, came.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Slavery
had been abolished a few years earlier, but that brought almost no improvement.
I think that slavery was abolished in 1886, but the living conditions of the
former slaves continued to be exactly the same or at times even worse than when
they were slaves, because when a slave died, the owner lost capital. After
slavery was abolished, the former owners did not care if they died, or got
sick, or went hungry. Nobody took care of them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
country’s economy began to revolve around the sugar harvest and with the sugar
harvest, what people called “dead time”. But there is no doubt that sugar
production was the backbone of, was the county’s entire economy, the other
things produced were for home consumption.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Coffee
was product of lesser importance. When the United States occupied Cuba and a
neo-colonial government was installed in this country, trade agreements were
made which even went as far as to limit the development of other crops. Cuba
was granted the market it already had and the growing market, which from that
time on was the U.S. market. New output was exported to that country and under
an agreement that they would buy sugar but the output of other food items,
including rice and others would be limited. Anyway, the country’s income, which
was not the Cuban people’s income —the Cuban people had to make do with the
leftovers, the remains, they had to get something for the services they
provided during the harvest or in crop growing between sugar harvests —but the
country made its living fundamentally from sugar cane and one could say,
without sugar there is no Cuba.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>That
saying continued to be true, we could say, up until 10 or 12 years ago. It had
its ups and down. When there were wars, then it was Cuba who supplied the
United States with all the sugar it needed, a curious, paradoxical thing with
immoral overtones. Every time there was a big war, joy spread among sugar
growers, because the price of sugar rose, and rose considerably, as a result of
wars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So
the First World War happened, the United States took part in the second half,
and then Cuba became almost the only sugar supplier to that nation, many of
whose companies were the owners of the big sugar plantations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
was remembering that after that war and the destruction and the problems that
it caused there was a huge demand for sugar. I think that it even reached the
price of 20 cents per pound —that will have to be looked up in the archives.
That was an enormous amount in those days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thus,
after the war, there was a short period which I heard people talk about when I
was a boy as the time of the dance of millions. Almost nobody talks about that
now, but people talked about it a lot in the ‘30s and ‘40s, about the dance of
millions, when the price of sugar increased six or sevenfold. Of course, it was
not the dance of the people’s millions. It was the dance of the big sugar
companies’ millions, the big sugar mill owner’s millions. There was, however,
always something for the people, the leftovers were for the people, and the
leftovers are not the same in a period when sugar is worth two, three or four
cents as when prices rise to 20 US cents or more per pound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
dance of millions didn’t last long. The price of sugar fell suddenly and what
came next was a catastrophe. It is not known how many owners lost their businesses
or how many land owners and sugar mill owners also lost their property which
was bought by other U.S. companies, or by some Cuban who had plenty of money.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thus
catastrophe followed the dance of millions. You work out how much suffering
that meant for the population who had nothing, not land, even though the
population was much smaller.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
situation of the sugar workers -- sugar being the most important source of
employment in the country – was extremely difficult. I couldn’t say right now
how many people were working in sugar, it might have been 200, 000, 300, 000 or
more — I don’t have the exact figures, the historians can look them up — when
the catastrophe like that after the dance of millions occurred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the ‘20s, prices, the economy, etc. were on the road to recovery until another
catastrophe happened, that of the 1929 crisis when the New York stock market
collapsed. Well, that catastrophe affected the United States, ten of thousands
of unemployed, affected the whole world and of course affected our country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>That
crisis lasted many years and got worse, especially after 1930, 1931, 1932,
1933. The price of sugar fell as low as one cent because, on top of the
international crisis, the United States imposed a tax on sugar and the price
dropped as low as one cent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
take careful note, some historian, some economists can do research into that
era to compare the value or purchasing power of one cent of one dollar in the
thirties, especially in 1932, 33. This was the time of Machado’s government; the
Machado dictatorship, an extremely hard and difficult situation which arose,
and times of extreme crisis are favorable, naturally, to social struggles,
rebellion and revolutionary processes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>So a great revolutionary process in our
country arrived, after the wars of independence; it was the process that began
with that crisis, under a repressive, bloody and, as a general rule, corrupt
government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Well,
some building works were undertaken in that period, the Capital Building, or
rather, they invested a loan in the Capital building — today it’s the Academy
of Sciences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then for years there was
tax on a box of matches, and on other products - this was to pay off those
loans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
good project was undertaken: the Central Highway. There were some other useful
building works and I think that they even made the Capital Building one inch
higher —look at the level of chauvinism and imitation— so that it would be one
inch bigger than the Capital Building in Washington. I think that the one we
have here is higher than the Capital Building in Washington by one inch, I
think. Well, we can rent it to them. We would have to ask the Academy of
Sciences permission, wouldn’t we? In an exchange of services we could rent out
our Capital Building, the twin brother of the Capital Building in Washington.
That was the degree of imitation we had, but that was with some of those loans
that were made in the early stages of that government, before the great crisis
of 1929 arrived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>That
crisis lasted almost until 1940, almost until the beginning of the second war;
it was the era in which a statesman, Roosevelt, won the elections in the United
States. Roosevelt could say that he saved U.S. capitalism and he saved it by
putting money into circulation; he applied a certain thesis of a famous
economist who argued that one of the ways of getting the economy off its knees
is by providing the masses with purchasing power. Roosevelt, within the
capitalist system, and by undertaking public works, dams, a heap of things, put
money into circulation and little by little they began to get out of the
crisis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Even
the most hard-line neo-liberals find themselves tempted to apply those theories
and they sometimes do apply them. That theory of lowering taxes, which have
been cut in the United States, mostly for the richest sectors, is based on the
idea that when taxes are lowered for tens of millions of workers, their
purchasing power is increased and demand for goods increases and the factories
start to produce. We will have to see how those theories work now that the
situation is really complicated. The news we get about the world economy is
generally very bad and the situation facing the U.S. economy is very uncertain.
The principle is, however, inject money.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If
Roosevelt did it by building, by investing money in building and in all kinds
of public expenditure, this time they are doing it, to some extent, by lowering
taxes. Even though this mostly benefits the richest, it is quite simply the
equivalent to the possibility of people having more money so that they start
buying cars again, building houses again, in short, all those luxury purchases
that have became the trademark of consumer societies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>What
our workers and our population in general suffered in those crisis years was
awful. 20 years later people had not forgotten it, in the 50s, 50 something,
people still talked about those Machado years, because people identified the
Machado years with years of hunger, of great poverty. In fact, these were not
the fault of those corrupt governments, they were the result of a world
economic crisis, a second phase of sugar crisis. However, a second world war
came along and once again Cuba became the supplier of sugar. There were German
submarines all over the place, the United States at war in Europe and the Pacific—
and it got most of its sugar supply from Cuba. The prices, given the value of
sugar at the time, were reasonably satisfactory, it was a profitable industry,
highly profitable because it was favored by certain preferential quotas which
had a higher price than the world market price. I don’t remember, but say sugar
cost 4 cents a pound in the world marker, quota prices were 6 or 7 cents a
pound<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>—the facts and figures about all
this will have to be looked up— and that brought the country a significant amount
of income.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Cuba
had a sugar quota of between three and four million — more figures to look up—
and Jesús Menéndez’s struggle was precisely to get a fairer distribution of
those preferential prices, of those profits for the workers. He started out and
achieved prominence as a memorable fighter and sugar workers’ leader by
demanding those enormous earnings be more equitably shared out, that the
workers receive a bigger share. This is why sugar workers truly adored Jesús
Menéndez, afterwards treacherously murdered in the McCarthy era.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
constitutional government that followed Batista’s government in 1944, before
the Second World War ended, the one led by a professor of medicine, Grau San
Martín, was made up of people who in 1933 had made a name for themselves,
earned some honor. However, they were actually people desperate to get into the
government so they could speculate and rob using all means possible. When that
government came to power, still at the height of the war, there were shortages
of lard, of many of that sort of product, there was a degree of rationing and
there were people who did big business dealing in all those rationed goods.
Prío’s government followed Grau’s government and I think it was around the time
the government changed hands that the assassinations of workers’ leaders
began.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since the worker’s leaders with
most prestige were the People’s Socialist Party leaders, which was what the
Communist Party used to be called, they began to murder, to eliminate those
leaders who were strong, who had great prestige, a great ability to mobilize
the workers; this was part of the policy implemented in our country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>That
war had once again reaffirmed the truth of the saying that there is no county
without sugar. Would this perhaps be the last one? No. We are still missing an
important chapter in history, the triumph of the Revolution. Since they wanted
to choke us to death they began to reduce our sugar quotas until they
eliminated them all together, and, in order to get more backing from the OAS —
that garbage! — and the support of the OAS countries, a large part of our <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>x</i> million tons was shared out among
Latin American countries. Sweets for everyone, as Grau San Martín would say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>They
shared our quota out among all the Latin American sugar-producing countries and
even gave concessions to some Asian countries, the Philippines and others, when
they shared out our sugar quota with its preferential prices. They left our
country with sugar as its main source of employment and world prices, which were
always below their preferential price. That was when another stage began for
the sugar industry and we could say it was the best of all stages because when
those guys had already stopped buying our sugar — it didn’t happen all at once—
the Soviets offered to buy one million tons of sugar. This was the first
benefit we obtained from our relations with the socialist camp; we found a
market. When those guys began to reduce their purchases, the Soviets began to
buy from us; when they took our sugar quota away completely, the Soviets bought
sugar from us at world market prices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
were no preferential prices in those first years. Later the campaign, the
blockade grew worse. The plans for attack, sabotage, the Bay of Pigs invasion
etc. began right from the first months. I think that it was perhaps in around
1961, I don’t remember when they completely eliminated the sugar quota but we
had already found a market in the Soviet Union. And later on, as the blockade
grew worse, they also set a preferential price.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It reached around two cents in the early years and of course, if
there were price fluctuations and prices have often been marked by
fluctuations, they paid us the high price that had been set on the world
market. The price rose to six, to eight, to nine cents, and, as a rule, every
time there were price fluctuations, they paid the price. In this way sugar
began to play or was already playing a main role.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Well,
the Soviets were not heavy smokers. We sold our tobacco elsewhere. We sold
goods and sugar as well, to some extent, on the world market in search of
convertible currency and to the USSR and then to other socialist countries
through the barter system we had with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Soviet
behavior was amazing. I remember when there was an outbreak of a strange deadly
disease in the sugar cane, which reduced our sugar output considerably, and we
couldn’t meet delivery commitments. They met all the merchandise delivery
commitments agreed to, even when we could hardly make even 50% of the sugar
deliveries that we were supposed to make.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
so the years went by. Relations grew closer and closer. They bought our nickel
and other products; our citrus plantations were developed basically to supply
the USSR. Thus an amazingly important thing happened.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>When we used to make an agreement for five years, the prices of
the goods were set, quite apart from what might happen with price fluctuations.
We kept an eye on the purchasing power of a ton of sugar because of the
phenomenon of unequal terms of trade, which is what operates in trade between
industrialized countries and underdeveloped countries. At the beginning of a
five year period it was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>x</i> and at the
end of that period it was 80%<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>x.</i> In
other words, our money, which was sugar, was loosing value, or purchasing power
because the prices of industrial products were increasing — and in those
agreements the price of sugar, of other goods could be fixed but not that of
millions of products. So we suggested that a formula had to be found to
compensate for that and that’s how we reached the agreement on what was called
a sliding price, in other words, if the prices of the main goods they exported
to us increased, the price of sugar would increase proportionally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It’s
obvious that we bought hundreds, thousands of all kinds of products; food
products, industrial products, tractors, trucks, as much as we could buy there;
televisions, washing machines, well, who better than the people know how many
things we imported. I think that we made up a basket with a number of Soviet
products and it included oil because they were our oil suppliers and that
happened before the explosion in oil prices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At
the triumph of the Revolution, the price was U.S.$14 per ton, not per barrel; a
barrel was worth U.S.$2.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
a result of the conflicts in the Middle East, at one of those times, some
response mechanisms were created. An organization was born and prices rose
considerably, to a high point which reached, I remember, U.S.$35 per barrel — I
don’t now know in what year exactly, we will have to check. The price went up
and up and up until later it began to slowly fall and fall for some reason or
other. Oil production increased greatly. Industrialized countries looked for
substitutes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>France,
for example, developed an atomic energy plan until 80% of its electricity was
generated by nuclear energy. Some countries like Italy did not build nuclear
power stations, there was a lot of resistance, but then, in the early morning
hours when the French had a surplus of electricity, the Italians bought
electricity from them at a price, I think, of four cents a kilowatt. They
closed down the thermoelectric stations during those hours and imported surplus
electricity from France. Nuclear power stations, due to their technical
characteristics, cannot be closed down without shutting down the reactor; the
thermoelectric stations can, however, be closed down in the early morning
hours, and so they were able to save oil, which was very expensive, and import
cheap electric power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>To
sum up, the industrialized countries had certain advantages: the first was that
all the monetary surplus created by the exceedingly high prices was deposited
in European and U.S. banks. So they had the money there to buy the oil they
needed, the money recirculated, not to Third World countries but to the rich
countries. But those who were industrialized were researching into car engines
that would go twice as far per liter or per gallon or three times as far. The
Soviets didn’t have these concerns because they reached a point where they were
producing up to 600 million tons of oil and 700 billion cubic meters of gas,
which is equivalent to 700 million tons of oil. In other words, the USSR had
the equivalent of 13 billion tons of oil, so apart from nuclear generating
stations and apart from the hydroelectric stations it had built, it had more
than enough oil and the world demand was not so great.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Sometimes
I think they were not very worried because they certainly didn’t have anywhere
to store the gasoline and, in order not to have to throw it into the sea, they
used it in engines which, as you know —the engine in the Zil for example— did
nine kilometers to the gallon and some buses, especially the gas driven
vehicles, trucks which were mostly what we bought, adjusting ourselves to the
offers we received. The diesel ones were a little more fuel-efficient. This is
important because those were the trucks we had left later on when the oil ran
out. Add it all up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
industrialized countries put their technology into practice, their research
centers and their other options and they multiplied, you might say, the use of
the energy contained in one ton of oil, compensating for those price increases
using the methods I’ve mentioned and others. They also saved fuel in industry,
always number one, when manufacturing cement, when manufacturing steel, when
manufacturing anything. The fundamental priority was saving energy, saving fuel
and they had the means to develop these technologies, plus the money on deposit
in their banks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Those
in the Third world had neither money deposited in their banks nor the
possibility of developing the needed technologies, so what they did was to go
incredibly deeply into debt. Since the banks had so much money on deposit,
which came from oil, they lent money to many countries, including those in
Latin America. At the time of the triumph of Cuban Revolution, in the first two
years, 1959 and 1960, I think that the Latin American foreign debt stood at
around US$5 billion dollars, there was practically no foreign debt. It grew a
little when the Revolution triumphed and the neighbors to the North began to
lend money and provide services to Latin American countries, something they had
never before done for those countries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
the dance of the oil millions began, they lent the oil money without making any
inquiries and thus they wasted and spent an incredible amount of money.
Something else, however, also occurs in those Latin American countries. Since
their currencies —any currency, no matter what its name is, peso, real,
whatever— are all unstable and lately more so than ever, those who possess any
money that arrives there are afraid that it will be devalued and that if they
have the equivalent of $100,000 it will turn into $50,000 or $20,000 or into
even less. Therefore the tendency of the money loaned to those countries was
for it to go back to them, either to pay for imports or as flight capital. See
how the economy works, or worked, because that is not going to last much
longer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
oil money is kept in their banks, and this money is lent to the south and from
the south it goes back to their banks. In each of these rounds what gets left
behind is extreme poverty and more and more poverty and more inequality between
the rich and poor countries. Thus this hemisphere, which had no debts, today owes
about U.S. $900 billion and then there are catastrophes, like the ones we have
just witnessed in Argentina or in Uruguay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>These catastrophes threaten who knows how many countries in the midst of
this economic crisis, because a substantial proportion of exports have to be
used to pay off this gigantic debt which they have already paid off once and
are paying again. So since it grows bigger and bigger daily anyone might
wonder: what possible future do these countries have? One doesn’t have know a
lot about history to understand that what awaits them is one crisis after
another until crises become generalized and insoluble in this hemisphere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

theoreticians of the North, from anywhere up there, the university professors,

find a solution, they are already sinking even deeper. And crises, in that way,
are going to become more and more frequent. Let’s suppose they manage to get
out of this one, how long will that last? Too many things have happened in the
last decade to think that there might be an immediate period of growth. When
one thinks about it, for every period of growth the abyss gets deeper and

in the capital from 37 to 20 or less, because it is less than 20; mountains of
new programs for training urgently needed, intensively trained teachers, for

the USSR collapsed and our sugar, which at one time reached a price of 40 U.S.
cents [per pound] most of which we exported to the USSR —in the USSR it reached
that price, it was less in other socialist countries, naturally. The Soviets
had a resource with which they paid us, basically oil. The other socialist
countries, depending on their ability to pay, also gave us preferential prices,
15 U.S. cents — that was an excellent price— and some of it we sold on the
world market. When the USSR became a big consumer of imported sugar, that fact
also influenced prices and influenced markets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At
one time I think the price dropped somewhat, because oil prices began to fall,
even though we tenaciously defended the prices we had, arguing the principle
that socialism means, first and foremost, helping the least developed countries
in the socialist community to develop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Even
the capitalists in Europe, the European Community, have applied this principle.
Among their members were countries like Portugal and Spain and others with a
per capita output that was maybe half that of other countries and they got
together, set up funds to help those European countries which were less
developed, in order to help them catch up, the idea being to create the
European Community which now exists and today issues the only currency which
can compete with the dollar. Before the dollar was the one and only, now there
is the Euro. We shall see how things develop, if it consolidates itself, if the
Euro becomes a real, strong competitor for the dollar.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From now on the money that escapes will not
only go into dollar deposits. It will of course continue to escape, because
they [poor countries] have no way to prevent it from escaping, not only because
of corruption but because the system destroys them and forces them and because
the International Monetary Fund forces this to happen, forces them to pay
debts, to close schools, to close hospitals and obliges them [to give in to]
the constant blackmail to which countries are subjected in order to be given a
loan. This is the situation and nobody can deny that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
prestigious Nobel Prize winner has just written a book talking about incredible
things. He was one of the directors of the World Bank, talking of the
established economic order. This writer is not an adversary, he is not a
Marxist, he is an American Nobel Prize winner. It would be worth while to talk
about and comment on what he says, it’s incredible. It’s not that he puts
forward a new theory about what has to be done, but that he talks of the
dreadful things that they have been doing which lead up to the brink of the
abyss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
would be appropriate to ask if it is the most logical, and it is almost the
only thing that one can ask oneself, can such a system free itself from these
methods? It would have to cease to exist, it has to apply them but by applying
them it will also have to cease to exist. These are laws. Ways? These are going
to be very diverse; they have not yet come on the scene, there is a whole
arsenal of formulas. In Argentina they have changed government two or three
times, an economic crisis appeared in Indonesia, as you know. It was the
gendarme, had a powerful army supported by the West and the personal fortune of
the head of its government amounted to U.S.$40,000,000.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
people will learn and will adopt its own measures, in some places, the
subjective factors. Look for example at the number of votes Lula received. And
news is now coming in from Ecuador that a leader considered to be radical,
originally a soldier, who is said to be a big fan of Chavez, was in first place
in the primary elections. I imagine that everyone will now get together to try
to block him, but you didn’t see these kinds of things before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
will see what happens in Uruguay, access to power will be gained one way or
another, the Argentinean way or the Brazilian way. Now don’t go thinking that
this means a revolution; it means popular and progressive forces will gain
access to positions of power. However, they are going to find economies that are
so tied to and dependent on all these made-up formulas that they won’t have an
easy job at all, so one can’t expect revolution or immediate radical changes.
No, no, the peoples’ struggle will begin, the peoples' consciousness will be
raised, and they will gain more knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Many
citizens of the developed countries and many Americans —they organize through
the Internet— will also be involved in the struggle to change this economic
order. Citizens of the United States, Canada and other developed countries,
with the support of Latin American intellectuals and activists, have organized
big struggles in Seattle, in Quebec, in other American or European cities. When
there are meetings of the Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the growing
resistance is amazing. It had began to grow even before the crisis; people were
worried about natural disasters, about environmental destruction, people who
have become aware of poverty and hunger in the world, in a world that today has
6,300 million inhabitants and all kinds of very serious problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>What
is this world going to do? They can’t start dropping atom bombs on it. This
world is pressing to emigrate to developed countries, almost, almost invading
them, risking their lives. On the Mexican border alone it is calculated that
about 500 people die every year trying to emigrate. Pressure to emigrate will
grow because there will be no other alternative but to develop the Third World
but nothing that is being done contributes to this but on the contrary, it
makes it poorer and poorer, there are measures to increase the plundering and
exploitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Millions
of consciousnesses in the developed countries themselves have been raised

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
have given this explanation so that it can be seen more clearly what this order
is creating and how our country, with its political system, this united people
which voted today, is calmly advancing towards the future. One can see, for
example, something phenomenal. Often our voters lists often reflected
under-registration, because people who were out of the country at registration
time did not appear on the list. Well, the number of people who are registered
over and above the previous election, two years ago, reached 300,000, a
spectacular increase!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Sáez
told me that more than 98% of those registered voted. And we know it rained. In
Havana itself yesterday there was one of the heaviest downpours I have ever
seen. The opposite of what happens in the provinces happens in Havana, at
midday 80% of people might have voted; many people vote in the afternoon.
Yesterday, of course, this had more impact. According to the information I
have, I think that, in spite of this, it was about 95.6% when the polls closed,
or something like that. The number of those registered who did not vote was
4.4%. But turn-out was excellent, as was the enthusiasm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>They
told me that in Arrtemisa 99 and a bit per cent of those registered voted. That
is incredible. (APPLAUSE) There you have our people’s unity, their general
education and their political culture, their fair social system, or one that
tries to be fair, tries and will always try to be ever more fair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
are quite aware of the inequalities brought about by special period, among
other things. But none of that prevents us from undertaking our social programs
which can be summed up in a single sentence, let’s say. The child of any Cuban
family receive a better education that the child of American millionaires and
multimillionaires.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Our
education system is already in a period of reform and improvement because it
still has many gaps but with gaps and all — and there are quite a lot of them,
we are aware of that and we also know how we are going to solve these problems—
at the primary level all the necessary conditions are being created to achieve
the optimal quality. Now only 2.6% of children in primary school are in
classrooms with more than 20 pupils. This problem should be solved by next
school year, this figure should be zero by then. And Havana, which used to have
the highest student/teacher ratio, almost 40 per classroom, and in hundreds of
them, between 40 and 50 per classroom, now has a teacher and a classroom with
no more than 20 students. You can see what a huge leap forward that is!
Industrialized countries have dreamed of this and not one of them has achieved
it nor will achieve it because they will not find the human capital in their
system. They cannot motivate, as we have motivated, thousands and thousands of
young people to become primary and secondary school teachers trained in a new,
intensive courses. We are now working on the secondary school level and from
there upwards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

able to say this is something that only one country in the world, a Third World
country, a country blockaded for more than 40 years, attacked, threatened,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
mentioned, for example, the example of our doctors. I stress once again that
our situation is different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
was explaining that the measures related to sugar had to go back in history, to
achieve what was achieved, the most extraordinary increase in wealth, resulting
from the sugar industry. When the collapse came, here are some figures: in the
year 1992, the price of sugar on the world market was 9.04 cents, and
production that year was seven million tons. The USSR had fallen, it had
disappeared; the price had already been reduced to 500 rubles, and then the
preferential price was reduced to zero. When they bought any quantities at all,
the bought them at nine cents. We had to seek out new markets, we had to seek
out everything. Naturally, the cuts had already begun, there were already a lot
of products that did not come in 1992. But at that price, sugar production was
still profitable; the revenue it brought was infinitely lower, but it was still
profitable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>What
was the price of oil in 1992? It was 15.99. If oil is at 15.99, and sugar is at
around nine or ten, then it is still profitable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Production
dropped abruptly to four million from one year to the next. This is when the
effort began to raise production again, but it was very difficult. Without
fuel, without fertilizer, with a major shortage of inputs, it was very
difficult to surpass this figure. On the contrary, production decreased even
further; at one point it went down to three million. Nevertheless, the effort
continued to be made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
1993 production fell from seven to four million. The price of oil was 14.25,
the price of sugar one the world market was 10.24; it had risen by just over
one point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Then
came the year 1994. The price of oil, 13.19; the price of sugar, 12.04 on
average.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
1995, the price of oil was 14.62 – it had gone up a bit – and the price of
sugar was 12.04.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
1996 the price of oil went up to 22 dollars a barrel. The price of sugar went
down to 11.41. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the year 1997, the price of oil went down a bit, to 20.61. The price of sugar
was 11.36.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
1998, the price of oil went down again to 14.19. The price of sugar went down,
to 8.77. That is to say, as of that year, sugar has consistently been below the
price of oil, which rose to 19.32 that year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
1999 the price of sugar went down to 6.14, and oil was still at 19. In 2000,
the price of oil was 30.35; the price of sugar, 8.14.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>From
that time on, with the exception of 2002, when it went down to 19.32, the price
of oil remained between 20 and 30 dollars. For example, in 2001, the price of
sugar was 8.36, and the price of oil was 25.85.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
2002, the last harvest, the average price of sugar was 7.43. This was creating
an unsustainable situation: the price of oil rising, the price of sugar
dropping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
is a circumstance that should be taken into account: in 1959-1960, after the
triumph of the Revolution, with one ton of sugar, at world market prices, it
was possible to buy eight tons of oil.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Today,
at current oil prices, which have been hovering around 30-something, it takes
two tons of sugar to buy one ton of oil.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
back then, in addition, the sugar industry barely consumed any oil. The
development of the Revolution led to the need for the mechanization of the
sector. Those who lived off of cane cutting completely disappeared; and tens of
thousands of people from the cities had to be mobilized to cut the sugar cane, until
the machines appeared and the harvest could be mechanized.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Before
the Revolution, almost everything was done by hand. With the exception of a few
farms that had a tractor or a truck, all of the sugar cane was cut by hand,
100%. Oil was not needed when people cut cane. Once the cane was cut, it was
gathered by hand, every last bit. It did not need to be transported to any of
the hundreds of collection centers in the country today, which clean the cane
cut by the machines, removing the straw, and using electricity. In other words,
the cutting, gathering, transportation and treatment of the cane, and a large
part of the planting, were all done by hand, and using oxen; lots of hoeing in
the months of July and August. And there were more than enough people to do all
of it. They cried for any payment at all offered to weed however many hectares
of cane, they begged for work, in the off season, weeding the sugar cane by
hand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Then
came the equipment. Machines and trucks compacted the soil, and then came subsoiling.
Chemical products were used to eliminate weeds, but were very costly.
Fertilizers were used to maintain the production capacity of the land. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Today,
producing a ton of sugar at current oil prices raises the cost in hard currency
of that ton of sugar by at least 40%. And so, what was the plan? The initial
plan aimed for reaching four million tons in 2002, this year. But along came a
major hurricane that wiped out the cane, cut it right down. In important
provinces like Havana, Matanzas, Villa Clara, Cienfuegos and Sancti Spíritus,
to a greater or lesser extent, it knocked over and destroyed the sugar cane
with winds of over 200 kilometers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
addition to all of the problems I have mentioned, of a historical and economic
nature, there is also the fact that we live on an island, where there can be
serious droughts, or sometimes severe flooding –climate changes have been
highly visible in our country in the last few decades – and also hurricanes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
was truly incredible to see two hurricanes pass through this year, along the
same path, only 10 days apart, and wipe out the citrus crops on the Isle of
Youth, and the citrus crops in Pinar del Río. Everything was on the ground,
destroyed. They barely managed to gather up what could be salvaged and shovel it
into a few trucks, to take it to the factories, and even so, they only managed
to recover about 10% of its potential worth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
the first hurricane passed through, grapefruit were selling at 1000 dollars a
ton. Solely through the citrus fruits knocked down, the country lost between 15
and 20 million dollars, because these grapefruit ripen early, at a time when no
one else can provide them to the market.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Two
hurricanes came through in the space of 10 days. You have seen the
mobilizations of people to Pinar del Río, because now they have to save the
tobacco crop. This has put pressure on the country’s reserves of products and
everything else, a lot of pressure. But we told them in Pinar del Río, “Do not
go below this figure, this amount of materials, and replenish it; never fall
below this point, because another hurricane can come along.” That is what we
said in Pinar del Río at the time of the first hurricane, and ten days later we
were back in Pinar del Río. The second hurricane had passed through, and when
the second hurricane passed through, we told them again, “Do not go below these
minimum reserves,” even if it is for first aid, for providing some amount of
housing or food. There are food reserves for these situations. And we were
being threatened by a fourth hurricane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
attitude we adopt in the face of a difficult situation is always the same. We
imagine that it has already happened and begin to think about what needs to be
done. We thought we were going to be hit by a fourth hurricane in less than a
year, and that just a few days before finally completing the program for
repairing, rebuilding and building 160,000 homes as a result of Hurricane
Michelle, we were going to have to start to repair the homes damaged by this
hurricane. So, in other words, weather conditions always pose an element of
risk within our plans for the production of sugar cane and sugar, and when a
hurricane comes through, a large amount of cane has to be cut by hand. I am
talking about objective factors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Then,
when the price of oil went up, situations arose. What was the production
target, for example? Four million tons of sugar. Projected inputs: 412 million.
Revenue from the 2.9 million tons left after subtracting the sugar for domestic
consumption: 433 million. Therefore, under these circumstances, the labor of
450,000 direct workers, two million hectares of land, and all of the capital
invested in industry and machinery, combines and trucks, would yield the
country around 30 million dollars. With the level of culture and knowledge
possessed by our country, this can be clearly seen as something dramatic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Speaking
of sugar prices, I should tell you how they were evolving this very year: in
January, 7.43; the average price of oil until now has been 26.95, but it
continues rising, and the threat of war in the Middle East – now they are going
to wage war on Iraq – could considerably raise these prices. No one knows, no
one is in a position to say what could happen if there is a war in Iraq, if the
price might go up to 40 dollars. Contingency plans have been drawn up in the
event of a drastic rise in price, over 30 dollars. We would basically guarantee
essential services, food, electricity, a number of things, and say: let us dig
in here and wait for two, three or four months to go by. Because it would
create an extremely difficult situation, and not just for the sugar industry,
but for all areas and services of the economy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
must not forget that the terrorist attack on New York dealt a heavy blow to
tourism, which had already been suffering a certain reduction in growth because
the price of oil had raised the price of traveling, and the majority of
tourists who come to Cuba travel from 8000 or 9000 kilometers away; the vast
majority come from Europe, or Canada. An increase in oil prices raises the
price of airfares, it has an effect. But in addition to this, an economic
crisis was already in the making, it had been evident since 2001, an
international crisis, and this would also have an effect on tourism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
so tourism had continued growing throughout all these difficult years, almost
20% annually, and then, suddenly it fell by 15%, and a heavy blow has also been
dealt to other exports, like tobacco exports, for example.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
was describing the evolution of sugar prices this year: January, 7.43;
February, 6.25; March, 6.06; April, 5.75. Well, in April it became crucial to
urgently adopt a decision, because the plan to sow 286,000 hectares was
absolutely impossible to implement, it would have been disastrous, that was
obvious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If
you analyze the situation of sugar on the world market, you will see that the
price protection agreements of the past disappeared with neoliberalism and
neoliberal globalization. The same thing has happened to the agreements on
coffee, and this has been catastrophic for the countries of Central America,
for example, which depend a great deal on coffee exports. In other words, the
basic export commodities of countries like these have been subject to serious
problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
was in April that an urgent decision was made; not another week could be lost,
the only prospects for the future were extremely low estimated prices for the
coming year. Imagine if we had sown the 286,000 hectares. There were already
8000 prepared and partially sown, fine, but not a single hectare more could be
sown at that time. And we began to save right there, because with regard to the
estimated expenditures, which would reach around 412 million – this was for the
year 2002 – drastic measures were initiated to reduce fuel consumption. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
also must not forget that in April there was a fascist coup attempt in
Venezuela, which interrupted our supplies, and for several months. This also
had an effect, because we had to spend even more money to obtain oil. In
situations like these, you have to devote the available resources to vital
matters. And so this was when the decision was made to restructure the sugar
industry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>What
does this signify in economic terms – this is very important – this thing we
are doing? Already, faced with the prospect of a product with very few
possibilities, this immediately means that the speculators control this market,
and so no one can be certain of any price. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
then there is the matter of excess production. India has a reserve of 10
million tons, and it has raised its production to over 10, or over 15, I do not
have the exact figures. Some told me that sugar production in Brazil is 20
million tons. The sugar cane that they had sown at a given point to produce
alcohol, because oil was very expensive – at the time when it when it went up
to 35 dollars a barrel, as I was saying, they sowed large quantities of sugar
cane to produce alcohol to use instead of gasoline, because gasoline cost 500
dollars – later, when oil prices started to go down during a certain period, they
converted this cane to sugar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Mexico
also increased sugar production; the United States was supposed to purchase a
certain amount, but did not. That is to say, many countries increased sugar
production, and now they are facing an extremely difficult situation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
this is not, you could almost say, the main enemy of prices. The food industry
has developed something called fructose from corn. It is a natural product with
a higher sweetening power than sugar. I remember the times when there were
little pills people used when they did not want to consume sugar, but then some
said they were harmful to your health. But in this case that cannot be said,
because this is a natural product, made from corn. The protein is used for
other purposes, for other products. It has much higher sweetening power than
sugar, and it costs half of what it costs to produce the same amount of sugar
from sugar beets or other sources.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So
we have seen the price of sugar decrease further and further, we have seen the
downward trend, and now with an international crisis, the poor countries will
also be forced to buy less sugar. There are no visible prospects for the
future, no logical basis to believe that the price could rise again, even if
only to 12 cents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
was only one logical thing to do: restructure the sugar industry. What does
this mean? Simply, to select the best sugar mills, with the best lands, the
ones that produce or could produce sugar at a cost of less than even four
cents. Of the 155 sugar mills, 71 have been selected that could reach this
goal, according to all the calculations made, the efforts that have been
underway, the work that Ulises mentioned here regarding the composition of the
stock, and so on, so as to reduce costs to less than four cents. If it goes to
four and a half cents, at least you do not lose money from the other revenues
obtained by the country. The country exports tobacco, the country exports
nickel, the country takes in revenue from tourism, the country receives revenue
for services, the country has sources of income that have sustained it. But
when you reach a point like this, it is impossible to plan on sowing 286,000
hectares of sugar cane; it is impossible to produce sugar like we have up until
now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Fine.
But restructuring does not signify anything traumatic. There will be 71 sugar
mills left from a total of 155, but the 71 have been well chosen. There is the
Lincoln sugar mill, for example. There will be 71 sugar mills, and 14 syrup
mills, to produce enriched syrup, for a total of 85, while 70 will no longer be
used in sugar production. Is this a major trauma? No, because in the last five
years, around 45 sugar mills have been out of use, almost all of these, except
for two or three, have been out of use for five years; an average of 45 over
the last five years, and for the last harvest, the one where we planned to
produce four million tons, there were 50 out of use. So in fact, there are only
20 more sugar mills being shut down permanently than were shut down during the
last harvest. It might seem like a terrible trauma, it might appear that way,
but since there were already an average of 45 out of use and 50 shut down in
the last harvest, there are really only 20 more sugar mills being shut down
now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>According
to the bases on which the restructuring is taking place, this will mean a
savings of 200 million dollars, through the restructuring and the new
production target, and revenues of around 100 million dollars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
are some Third World countries that subsidize sugar. Brazil, for example,
provides millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies for
sugar production, because if a certain number of mills were shut down, it would
lead to very serious social problems for the hundreds of thousands of people
who would be left unemployed. It is impossible, and this is the cause of one of
the biggest headaches facing sugar cane producers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
Mexico, I have heard, the sugar mills that were privatized under the influence
of certain illusions are now being taken over by the state again. That is the
role of the state in capitalist countries: every time an industry is in ruins,
they take on the burden of all the costs and expenditures. In any of those
countries, closing down a sugar mill is a tragedy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
our country, the fact that 50 sugar mills were not in operation in 2002 has not
been a tragedy. Not a single worker has been left without protection, without a
salary; they have lacked for nothing. Our socialist state could shut down 45
sugar mills, without anyone realizing it. On the contrary, many things have
improved at the sugar mills. They have been building homes, they have been
improving the food provided to the workers, they have even been carrying out
cultural activities. They have been organizing and creating a structure for
sugar cane production in conditions favorable to this task.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
only thing happening now is the decision to permanently shut down the sugar
mills that incur major losses. And far from creating problems, we know that
there has been full understanding on the part of the sugar sector workers, in
both the industrial and agricultural branches, with whom meetings were held as
soon as possible, when everything had been well organized. Remember that the
decision was made in April.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
publicly explained the need for doing this, and everyone knew that a
restructuring was going to take place. There were of course concerns and
questions, but all of these problems have practically been resolved. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Not
a single worker will be negatively affected in the slightest. On the contrary,
they will benefit considerably.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For
the moment, the country is saving 300 million dollars; this is like a
contribution of 300 million dollars to the economy. An expenditure of 200
million has been canceled, while 100 million will be earned; if there were to
be an increase in sugar prices at any given point in time, the revenue would be
a bit higher. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
remaining sugar mills have the capacity to produce up to four million tons. In
addition, if it were deemed advisable, due to an increase in prices, the syrup
mills could produce sugar as well. We know what every hectare can produce, if
you irrigate, if you use fertilizers and have the necessary computers, of if we
all have the capacity to do the calculations and realize that we are putting ourselves
in a situation where there can be no harm done, and on the contrary, we can
take advantage of any eventualities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
was saying earlier that this was historic. Well, first I wanted to say
something. This restructuring does not mean the disappearance of the ministry,
far from it, nor of the hundreds of thousands of excellent workers, so well
organized and with so much awareness acquired throughout history, and above all
during the pre-Revolutionary and Revolutionary struggles in our country. It is entirely
just that we should strive for this force to produce much more for the country,
for the economy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
sugar industry will not disappear, far from it. On the contrary, new lines will
be developed. I could cite, for example, some of the major production areas.
Sugar, including the 600,000 or 700,000 tons we consume ourselves, on which we
can save more than 40 million. You see, there are the revenues obtained by
producing sugar at less than four cents and continuing to strive to lower costs
even more, and then on the sugar we consume ourselves, that is not exported, we
save over 40 million dollars. Our sugar, the sugar we buy, will cost the
country 40 million dollars less in expenditures. Just look at the benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Energy
will be produced. They have considerably improved the production of energy with
the bagasse that is available. Final syrup: apart from the 14 syrup mills, the
71 will also be producing their corresponding percentage of syrup. Enriched
syrup, which is something else, it is not final syrup, but rather the enriched
syrup that will be produced by these 14 syrup mills. Liquid sugar, which is
used extensively in the food industry. Yeast, a form of protein with a variety
of uses. Organic sugar, because around the world there are a growing number of
people who are terrified of pesticides, leading to an increasing demand for
organic products that are not treated with any kind of chemical pesticides or
herbicides or fertilizers, and that are fertilized instead with manure. Sugar
cane wax, for the production of high molecular weight alcohols, in other words,
for the production of PPG, a pharmaceutical product that is increasingly
admired in the country and abroad. Sorbitol, another product with various
industrial uses. Furfural; fatty acids; preserves; and other traditional and
new products. New products are constantly being sought out. There is, for
example, something called refined alcohol, an extremely high grade alcohol with
a very high price, but with a limited market up until now. As the markets for
some of these products grow, the decision can be made for a certain syrup mill
to be devoted to producing this kind of alcohol, or for a certain sugar mill to
be used for some other purpose, and when the calculations are made carefully,
this will contribute more to the country’s economy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Another
thing: the Ministry of the Sugar Industry will use the surplus lands to produce
vegetables, fruit, milk, meat and other food, as well as wood and paper, which
may be among the most promising production lines, given the extremely high
prices of paper and pulp owing to the growing shortage of forests around the
world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>All
of these projects have been carefully studied. In some cases they may be
changed; for example, a product may emerge that is more profitable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>They
also produce organic fertilizers. There are considerable prospects for organic
farms, because the produce raised on them could one day be exported, and these
crops would be highly profitable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
fact is that a million hectares of land will be available to them, over a
million hectares, and much of this land is not currently under cultivation,
because it was reserved for sugar cane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
workforce now made available is not that great in number. These 20 sugar mills
closing down, added to the 50 that were already not in use, will entail a labor
surplus of between 58,000 and 60,000 workers. Many of these workers have had
other employment during the time the sugar mills were not operating in one area
or another, they help out. And so the potential workforce is no greater than
60,000, according to the studies carried out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Fortunately,
alongside the need for restructuring, and finding a solution for these workers,
an upgrading program emerged for all sugar industry workers who chose to use
it. How many so far have opted for the study program as full-time employment? I
believe there are 33,200, more or less. How many are there, Ulises? There are
33,170 registered. And how many are registered in total for the course
beginning on this historic day? There are 84,271, correct? That is because
there are over 51,000 who will continue working and attend the upgrading
classes at the same time. So the program that was conceived for the surplus
workforce has now been extended to those who will continue working, because otherwise,
they would be at a disadvantage, and there are 51,000 of them registered in the
upgrading courses. Therefore, these courses are not only for those who make up
the surplus workforce, but for a larger number of people. Who knows how high
the total number could rise, surely it could reach 100,000.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
remember when we started the comprehensive upgrading programs for unemployed
youth. At the end of the course there were 86,000, and today there are 116,000
young people between the ages of 17 and 30 registered, with every opportunity
to study. There are over 30,000 who are senior high school graduates, and will
soon be able to begin higher studies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They can either find a job or continue studying, as they wish. Any one
of these workers in the upgrading courses can study, whatever they want,
practically whatever they want. A workforce is being saved and trained, and if
the moment comes when they are needed, if new industries are begun here or
elsewhere, we will have people who work in mechanics and have received
vocational school training, or vocational training school graduates and have
become engineers, or engineers who have continued to study and earned master’s
or doctorate degrees in engineering. Just imagine. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Now
then, you all know that the average educational level in our country is already
higher than ninth grade. And that does not tell you everything, because in the
near future, with the new techniques being applied, and the programs being
carried out, ninth grade graduates will have three times the knowledge of a
ninth grade graduate today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
there are also areas in the countryside where some people have not reached
sixth grade. Many have learned to read and write, but have not gone past the
sixth grade level. I do not have the exact figures by age group, but the
average age is around 30. Now there are tens and thousands of young people
registered who can study whatever they want, and they are guaranteed something
that no other country in the world can do, not only because the system does not
allow it, but also because they need a surplus of workers. We have a workforce
reserve that is studying and being trained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
can have 19 students per primary school teacher, but we can have 20, or 19, or
18, or 17, or 15. The quality of education is better that way, and we are going
to do the same thing in the secondary schools.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Today
a high school teacher has 40 students in each class, and can have 200 or 300
students altogether. Sometimes they do not even know all of their names, and
they have no relationship with the students’ families. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
program we are carrying out in the high schools is aimed at having one teacher
teaching all the different subjects, with one teacher for every 15 students.
This does not exist anywhere else in the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>All
of these things I am saying about education explain our absolute and total
certainty that we will move ahead of all the rest, because we know what is
happening in other places, and why it is impossible for them to apply the
measures that we are applying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
so there are a number of people, around 7000, who will be undertaking sixth
grade studies in these schools, and then seventh and eighth grade. All of the
rest have more than a sixth grade education, and many are junior high school
graduates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
total of 22,239 will be taking senior high school courses. I imagine that each
one will choose what is best. If a man is 35 and a senior high school graduate,
he can be given refresher courses and then study for a university degree. If he
is 40, he may still have 20 working years left. If he is 20, it is better. If
he is 35, he can work until he is 65.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
are many people who are 70 and do not retire, there are a huge number of
professionals and intellectuals who do not retire at 60, and there are some
professions where people are 80 and continue working, particularly in the
intellectual sphere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Now
then, there are 10,639 in upgrading courses for higher level education; 5495
university educated professionals, because they, in this restructuring carried
out by a government commission, with the ministry and the various
organizations, have worked on drawing up these programs, which are tentative.
One of these numbers could change, not only the number of those completing
senior secondary studies, but also those in upgrading or refresher courses. And
so there could eventually be as many as 20,000, or 30,000, or 40,000 who opt
for university studies, while those who are already university graduates could
opt for other degrees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
sugar industry alone will contribute 4433 instructors, and I am not referring
to that list anymore, which at this point includes 84,271 people, as I said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
you can see, this is a form of employment. As part of the restructuring, they
carefully reviewed everything, and not only those who work in the industry, but
also in the support structures and enterprises, and there are thousands of
university educated professionals available. And so now, not only are over five
thousand going to undertake university studies after already having completed
university degrees, but also they will provide 4433 instructors. You can see
that this is a form of employment, these workers will become teachers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

we had the good fortune of seeing someone who was once a teacher, and then for
many years was in charge of a group of cadres, but who has now proudly
proclaimed here that she will go back to teaching. It was impressive to hear
her speak and see her enthusiasm. This program is creating 4433 teachers in
this way, who will enrich the hundreds of thousands, the more than 200,000
teachers in the Ministry of Education. You can see the benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

Ministry of Education will provide 1617 teachers. There is no need for any new
buildings, because the classes begin at 5:00 p.m., when all the high school
students have finished for the day. And at all these sugar mills, like
everywhere else in the country, there are high schools with computer labs and
audiovisual equipment. One of the first things that can be studied, with a
certain prior level of education, is computer science, and this will not cost a
penny, except perhaps in certain cases where more computers will be needed.
There is no need for any new buildings. All the audiovisual equipment is
available, with no need for extra expenditures. The teachers are available with
no need to increase the education budget. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to broadcast. The final tests are being carried out in one province, but I do
not want to scoop the news from the educational channel, I will let them be the
ones to announce the day it begins.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
so by the time this course is finishing up, our whole country will have the
educational channel, as added support for all these programs. But in addition,
there are 12 hours of educational programming on the other channels, two hours
on Saturday, two hours on Sunday. Educational power is growing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
are other things I have not mentioned. This country is developing a higher
educational center of excellence. But we should not get ahead of events. It is
already established and functioning, and will eventually have 10,000 students,
we believe. The first 2000 are already studying, chosen from among the best
senior high school graduates in the country. This capital is no small thing
when it goes to work, I can assure you. We see the same thing everywhere; while
universities are shut down and budgets are cut elsewhere, our services to the
people, in vital matters, are being increased, doubled or tripled, especially
in terms of quality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>You
were all witnesses to the 779 schools in the capital that were rebuilt, including
33 newly built ones, 779 schools, and it was all done in less than two years.
They started construction in November or December of 2000. When visitors come,
they simply cannot believe it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
also have pilot projects underway in secondary schools, involving thousands of
students. Around 7000 young people are receiving intensive training as junior
high school teachers in accordance with the new principles, and they will be
ready to go to work next year. We should not think in terms of quantity, but rather
in terms of quality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>You
can see for yourselves whether or not this is an important moment. This has
come to surpass the initial goal, which was to provide employment as students
for those who ended up as surplus labor in the sugar industry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
has not only been a reorganization of the sugar mills. In all of the ministry’s
support enterprises, excellent work has been done, and the better that work is,
the more people can be sent to study. But they will also have an advantage:
they will no longer have to travel to Havana, or Santa Clara, or anywhere else
to study for a university degree. They will be able to undertake university
studies right in the sugar mills, just walking distance from their homes, and
in the case of some on the cooperative farms, they will be able to get there on
horseback. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
real fact that we can announce here today is that each sugar mill will become a
university center (Applause). We will have to see how many senior high school
graduates there are who have not finished university. Any town that has a
junior high school or a vocational school, I repeat, can become a university
center. Now that is really something unusual in this world, is it not?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
a school needs to be built, we build it, and we can build it if we save, if we
do not throw money away, if we do not throw hard currency out the window, and
money is being saved. And not only in this area; a whole series of measures are
being adopted to save hard currency. And that is not all: the country’s
production of oil and gas is increasing, and by the end of this year, we will
be producing the equivalent of 4.1 million tons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Something
else: next year, practically all of our electricity will be produced with our
own fuel. What does this signify? The Guiteras plant, as soon as it goes into
operation, thanks to certain investments, will save the country, at current
fuel oil prices, 50 million dollars in fuel. And Cienfuegos, which is the only
electric power plant still pending, with an initial investment – another will
have to be made during the next two years – will already be saving 30 million
dollars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Add
up 50 plus 30: that makes 80, and at the same time we are making investments in
oil drilling, that have absolute priority. We are also investing in joint
ventures for land exploration. The oil that is shared with the international
companies is a bit more expensive, but our own can be produced for 40 dollars a
ton, while the cost of fuel oil today is 160 dollars. In the joint ventures, we
are partners, and the cost of the oil is slightly higher, because in these
cases we have to add the part that corresponds to the foreign partner; that
amount is reduced to a certain extent after their investment is recovered. The
cost will end up being around 60 dollars a ton. I could add that there is a
program underway for investment in oil production, in order to reach 4.8
million tons of oil and gas next year. An increase of 700,000 tons of oil
equivalent, that will not only serve to replace fuel oil in the thermoelectric
plants, but in other important production lines as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>To
continue increasing the exploitation of the natural gas produced along with
oil, the second stage of the combined cycle in Matanzas will be concluded this
year; the first is already functioning. The first stage of another plant, here
to the north of Havana, is under construction and partially in use. The two
plants will have approximately the same capacity as one of the nuclear reactors
we were working on for so long in Cienfuegos. They will operate 24 hours a day
and exploit almost 60% of the energy contained in the gas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>These
are advances of one kind and another and another, and if we add them all up, it
might be possible next year for our country to dispose of some 600 million
dollars in resources more than this year, in the midst of this whole situation,
and always prepared for difficult times. We have to contemplate all of the
possibilities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If
the economic crisis worsens, if a war breaks out, no one can predict the
consequences of that war in one of the world’s main oil producers. That country
has one of the world’s largest oil reserves, one of the largest! We must be
prepared and organized to respond in the pertinent economic field, always
knowing what is sacred and what is fundamental, and that cannot be touched.
This country is perfectly well prepared to withstand three months, five months,
six months if special restrictions were made necessary by problems of this
kind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
is the current situation in our country, which serves as the framework for this
restructuring, this ceremony we are holding, and the beginning of the classes
for 84,000-plus fellow Cubans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
know I have spoken at length, but I felt it was necessary to take up your
attention in order to offer you the explanations I believe to be advisable on a
day like today, so that there is the greatest possible knowledge of what we are
doing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>These
are new ideas that have emerged, I tell you, in the midst of the battle of
ideas; in a situation in which the country has been creative, and become organized,
and developed its capacities. I do not ignore the errors, but there will be
other times to talk about errors. We talk about them whenever we can, always in
accordance with our belief in telling the truth to the people, without any kind
of fear, because that is what contributes to an ever greater political
awareness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
do not know how those countries facing such major disasters will be able to
work things out. There are countries, for example, with newly elected
governments, that had the support of 70% of the population, but now have the
support of 12%, or 13%, or 14%. How can the grave social problems of any
country be solved without the support of the majority of the population, at
least, without the support of the masses? Everyone knows that nobody trusts any
political party anymore, because they have spent too long making promises,
promises and more promises, while following a path that leads only to disaster.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Could
we solve the problems I spoke of today if our people did not have complete
trust in our Party, in our youth organizations, in our organizations of
workers, of peasants, of students, of women, of the Committees for the Defense
of the Revolution, of millions and millions? Can any one of you imagine that we
could face problems of this kind in these moments, without that trust, without
that unity of a people that has never been deceived, a people that has already
succeeded in achieving a feat that could never have been achieved by any other
country? It is difficult to withstand 43 years of a blockade and to have done
what has been done in 10 years of the special period. The time is coming to
reap the fruits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For
the moment, when the special period arrived for all the rest, and some
proclaimed that the end had come for the ideas of socialism, here they will
find a country that is prospering, advancing, doing things that countries
living under the capitalist system could never even dream of doing. Yes, the
feat we have achieved is becoming a unique case in all history.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Now
we will see how they emerge from their special period, with all of the
consumerism they have created, the world poverty, the 2.5 trillion dollars of
debt. It would be interesting to observe the events, and report on them all
along the way: they have achieved this, they have made a minor advance, they
have regressed here and there. And our people will have enough awareness to
know what the world is all about, and what is happening in the world. That is
why history is so important, the history of our country, so that they know
where things are happening and what the roots were of what our people are doing
today. And throughout the world, because communications truly have become
globalized in the world today, everything, the economy, neoliberal
globalization has been imposed and has led them to the current situation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
must continue to work, with ever greater zeal, always prepared for any
difficult situation that may emerge, profoundly hopeful about the future that
awaits us, because it is being built on solid foundations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
have nothing more to add, and I will conclude with the certainty, now more than
ever, that all Cuban patriots and all Cuban revolutionaries, which has become a
grandiose honorific title, will fulfill their duty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
