have given me a truly difficult task. At this moment I should like to be as
eloquent and as erudite as many, we could say almost all, of those who have
spoken here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>All
my life I have tried to find the essential nature of things and, starting from
that essential nature, to try to guess what is going to happen or what might
happen. Sometimes things do not happen when we want them to happen or do not
happen as soon as we want them to, but happen later. I do not think that I am
the only person who has been wrong about some predictions. Everyone knows that
revolutionaries want things to happen soon, but they take a little longer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>We
ourselves tried to begin to make the Revolution in 1953 and later we had to
resign ourselves to waiting five years, five months and five days, it seems
like some cabalistic thing, doesn’t it? That does not come from Cavallo; it is
actually a word in the dictionary (Laughter).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Here
we have really heard many interesting things, and I had the privilege to be
present at most of the plenary sessions. We have attended the four annual
economists meetings and the difference between the first meeting and this one
are striking, and one should ask why. I am not going to give an answer, one
must ask oneself or rather understand that it is what has happened over the
last few years that has more or less changed even the language used at this
meetings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>We
have learned some remarkable things in these last three years and especially in
the last two years and most especially in the last six months because of events
that were seen coming and which today are here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:
justify'><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In that first meeting in 1998 it was
still the end of history, and from what we see today, that is still a long way
away. Months, half years, years of economic growth, miracles in Japan which
began to stop being miracles about four years ago in spite of the fact that so
much was said about that miracle; miracles in east Asia which seemed to be on
an unstoppable trajectory; miracles in the economies of our neighbors in the
North, where they kept a record. They took note of every day that went by
without a crisis until the end of the year 2000 when signs indicating a
reduction in industrial output began to show. Then the well-known theories were
trotted out immediately: that when there had been so many consecutive months of
backsliding in industrial output then it was already a serious problem for the
economy, it was starting to be a downturn, a recession, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Employment
began to fall in the United States and what many expected began to take place,
as an inevitable consequence of the way in which that economy had grown and of
the changes that had taken place. Everything had changed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At
meetings like this one can see the relativity of things, of historical figures,
of the interpretations given to every event. Up until now they talked about the
unfairness of the economic order and the international financial institutions,
both global and regional, the latter depending on the former. And we have
sometimes mentioned here some of those institutions, I can say sincerely that
we did not mean to hurt their representatives who have been with us, helping to
give this meeting the character it always wanted to have, that of an open
debate of ideas, positions, viewpoints, because we should not be afraid of
listening to any point of view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>From
the first meeting we were aware of the attitude of many of the participants
towards the representatives of those institutions. The first of them to come
was the World Bank, which has attended the four meetings. This time there have
been new things, very well-known people who had not come before, they would not
have had much to say then, but this time several of them were in attendance:
two winners of the Nobel Prize for Economics and one Nobel Peace Prize,
although the latter has done us the honor of attending meetings in our country
on more than one occasion. We even heard via television someone whom they say
will be a future Nobel Prize winner and maybe he will. But I do not know if
those who decide who will get the Nobel Prize will take it upon themselves to
grant such an honor, and the large amount of money that comes with it, to
people who have decided to speak frankly about the realities which they see
today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
1998 what could distinguished academic and professor Joseph Stiglitz have told
us? He was not yet a Nobel Prize Laureate and this crisis had not yet happened,
although perhaps the one in Southeast Asia had, it was the first, then the
Mexican, which is not usually associated with the one that began in 1998 in the
Far East. Now these are events that have been happening one after the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
here we were meditating, because that is what we did, meditate and meditate,
while the others were saying what they thought according to an approved agenda:
first, economic issues were discussed, among which the situation in Argentina
predominated, precisely because —as I said to Pérez Esquivel after the
afternoon session was over— Argentina was the paradigm of neoliberal
globalization and today it is the paradigm of the failure of neoliberal
globalization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
was ample discussion, trying to explain the causes and possible solutions of
issues related to the economy and globalization and this theme took up, we
could say, about 30% or 40% of our time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Other
economic issues were discussed, particularly those in the agenda of the
meeting. I was not able to hear what was said today about the multilateral
investment agreement, but it is something fairly well known. It was mentioned
here by Professor Borón, if I remember rightly, as proof of things that can be
done, such as the timely denunciation of that conspiracy, because it was worked
out using the favorite technique of the world masters, that is, conspiracy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Yes,
I said world masters because some of those institutions that we mentioned here
do not exist in their own right; they exist because there is a world system of
domination. These institutions, both the IMF and the World Bank have very well
known masters, although their roles were different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
think that the World Bank has been dragged to do things and obligated to give
up the tasks assigned to it at the end of the war, which were to promote social
development, and it has been forced to dedicate, completely, to salvage
operations. I know the opinion of the majority of those who work at that
institution, they are opposed to those tasks which have been and still are
imposed on it, although our powerful neighbor to the North has no veto right
there as it does in the International Monetary Fund; a veto power it uses in an
unrestricted way. Just like in the UN Security Council, where they have used
their veto right at least four or five times more than all the other members of
the Security Council combined. A decision is never taken which they oppose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If
it happens there, in no less a place than the institution which represents the
world, that embryo of an international authority, a world authority, to which
they do not even want to give the funds to keep it going, what will they not do
with the International Monetary Fund —and I beg those of you who are here
representing the IMF to take any mention or reference to that famous
institution as a criticism of a system and not of the professionals who work
there or come and go and where not all opinions are exactly alike either. Some
hold some opinions and others hold other opinions that are less extreme right
wing, less radical, less brutal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
hope that in the future... Well, there is no need to say, “I hope”, because
these meetings will become increasingly interesting. If so much news has piled
up in six months, what happens in the next 12 months will really merit serious
analysis, since highly significant changes have taken place, both in the
political and the economic fields.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>How
the famous FTAA, which was discussed here, is getting along will have to be
analyzed too. It is a subject that was discussed here not very long ago, in a
meeting on that issue specifically. It is something that was discussed here by
the Sao Paulo Forum people as well. Almost all intellectuals and all people who
think, who know the issues, have already made up their minds about the FTAA
and, as a rule, the overwhelming majority of them are opposed to the FTAA.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
dangerous thing about the FTAA is not the points of view of intellectuals,
economists and political thinkers, the dangerous thing about the FTAA is that
the ordinary people in the countries of our hemisphere do not have enough
information about it. Many of them have high levels of illiteracy and there are
hundreds of millions of people who do not have the education but only their
personal experience to try to understand what the FTAA means theoretically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Look
how this hemisphere has fallen into debt. Even parliaments were not consulted
about it; often not even cabinets were consulted. It was the ministers of the
economy or finance who, more or less in combination with the highest political
authorities, made the decisions. In fact, the huge debts —and I think someone
said it here— began to be contracted on a massive scale under tyrannical
governments, bloody governments who did not consult anybody. Perhaps those
debts and their aftermath partly led to what is known as the democratic
opening, which is no doubt something much better than what was there before,
because the vanishing and murdering of people largely ended and repression was
considerably reduced, although it still exists. But all of those enormous debts
were contracted behind the people’s back. Often the private banks or the
government banks tried to persuade the population that it was a big deal that
they had solved the economic crisis because they had managed to get a loan of
10 billion or 20 billion or 30 billion from the International Monetary Fund. No
one knew what the consequences of that would be, they could not understand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
1985, 17 years ago, important meetings were held in Cuba all through that year:
meetings of Latin American students, peasants, women, workers organizations and
of political and intellectual figures of all stripes. The meetings could not be
held here, but in the Karl Marx Theater that can sit 6,000 people. There were
days and days of analysis, of speeches. Yes, we listened to 100, 120, 130
speeches.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>What
was the purpose? To build an awareness about the debt. There are lots of
material and some messages from those days. I remember that after each one of
those meetings we would send the materials on what had been discussed to all
heads of states, with some obvious exceptions. The Pope was included, as a head
of state, and afterwards we were pleased to see that one of the causes the Pope
took up was precisely that of the debt which was discussed in the Rome Synod in
connection with the fight against poverty and the debt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Africans were not yet very concerned because their debt was not very high, they
had not borrowed as much as the Latin Americans, therefore, they did not
attached much importance to it. Now, they do. The Latin Americans took it more
seriously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Of
course, some goals could not be achieved. But, back then it would have been
enough if one country, just one of the big three, had reacted against the debt
and said: “I am not paying” and then a real solution to the debt crisis could
not have been avoided and at least 10 or 20 years of moratorium would have been
won.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
few minutes ago someone explained that this idea of not paying a debt had a
historical precedent around the beginning of last century. I think it was Borón
who said that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
do you know which country it was that could have taken that decisive step? It
was Argentina, which was suffering the worst consequences. But perhaps the time
has not yet come to make public some of the efforts made to try and persuade
one of the big three. The big three were: Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
rather not say more here, because the effort was to build an awareness, to
mobilize the masses and to try to persuade some leaders to make the decisions
that would have made it possible to find a solution, like the solution that
should have been found ever since. This gave time to the rich countries,
especially the big creditor countries in the North, who were then playing
around with interest rates. Generally, the agreements were such that when
interest rates went up the rates of debt contracted also went up. It was not
like now when they have lowered the rate to 1.75 on this, the 12th time that,
resorting to such desperate measures, they lowered the interest rate to that
point to do battle with the recession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So,
if the debt in Latin America was 300 billion back then, the debt in the middle
of last year, 2001, already stood at 750 billion. It had more than doubled and
I would have to make a more accurate calculation to know how much it will be in
2002. Someone over here said that the Mexicans had reduced their foreign debt a
little last year. In Argentina and other countries, however, it grew and I do
not know who could look up the data to find out if the debt actually reached
800 billion. It is just that now conditions are different, because this is the
most serious and threatening economic crisis there has been since the end of
World War II.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Nobody
should have any doubts about that; I know you do not, because you have said so
here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Now
a much larger debt has to be paid off, and now, in addition to a huge debt, the
national assets, fundamental assets, with few exceptions, including the most
hallowed, have been privatized. Before, they were debtors who had something and
now they are debtors whose debt has risen greatly and it continues to rise but
they have nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>These hundreds of millions of dollars in
privatization must be added to that debt. Before, they were like a reserve;
today, they are no more. Which is why the situation is much more serious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
that debt is now compounded with that of Africa, and Asia to the point where it
exceeds two trillion, although, in that sum we, the Latin Americans, had as the
Olympic champions; we are in first place, gold medal; without gold nor any hope
of gold. This is a world problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Moreover,
there was no WTO in 1985; there was something called GATT. Yes, we had hoped to
hold a GATT or UNCTAD meeting here, we were going to use this conference
center, plus an extension for the offices needed, which in the end became a
hotel, because we realized that it was not even worth the bother; the United
States was fiercely opposed. The GATT metamorphosed into the WTO. That is
another of the powerful tools for plundering and exploitation, and it is in the
hands of the world masters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
latest meeting in Qatar was mentioned here at some point. They found a desert
country that was really hard to get to by road or by boat and not only because
of the distance but the fare to get there was also very expensive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
have to say, to honor the truth —and it was also mentioned here this afternoon—
that Americans and Canadians with Internet, intellectuals and generally middle
class people, communicating through that very channel, were the ones who
organized the Seattle protests, the New York protests, the Quebec protests. So
that the G-7 and the others no longer have anywhere to meet. I thought that
perhaps in that new orbiting space station they might prepare a few cabins to
get the G-7 group together. They have already admitted that it is becoming very
difficult, so they have found themselves a mountain in Canada for a G-7 or a
WTO meeting, a very high, far-off, cold and deserted mountain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Last
year Davos looked like the trenches World War I which some of you have seen in
the photos of the Battle of Verdun or the Battle of the Marne. And the Swiss,
always so peaceful and neutral, had an army there with helmets and all kinds of
gears so that those protesting could only get to that hill where they do winter
sports. And so, having learned their lesson, they went to no less a place than
New York for their meeting. Now they have changed their language a bit; they
used certain misleading and mealy-mouthed words, which is a method, a style.
But it could not even be in Switzerland, thus they took advantage of the
situation and the security measures adopted there in that city after September
11.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

this is related to some of those events that are taking place at this time. If
you will give me a few minutes I will take up this point later when I am

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

Guantánamo naval base. (Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

have heard you talk, for example, about the Manto Base and the others here and
there and I thought that we too have a foreign base for almost a century now.
It was imposed on us in the first few years after that intervention when Spain
was exhausted and could not keep fighting its colonial war. An intervention
that followed misleading speeches and a joint declaration of the U.S. Congress
which ended in a war, an occupation and something called the Platt Amendment
which gave the U.S. government the right to intervene in our country with its
armed forces if there were any disturbances that threatened its interests. It
was an amendment which they made us add to the Cuban Republic’s constitution,
one that deeply hurt many patriots to whom they offered this alternative, with
reference to the country’s independence: Take it or leave it. And that was when
the fourth year of military occupation was already over and the Constitution of
the Republic was under discussion. It must have been awful. Some were
completely opposed whatever the consequences but others thought that accepting
the amendment was unavoidable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
was no longer a Liberation Army, it had been disarmed. The Revolutionary Party,

founded a party to organize, direct and make a Revolution before Lenin founded

emancipated from slavery and there was no proletariat. That man had the genius
to tackle the most complicated problems in the face of Spanish propaganda and
he even used some phrases from Marx, one of them is very beautiful: “Since he
took the side of the poor, he is worthy of honor.” But what vision he had,
writing at the end of the 19th century about “alca-ish” attempts! When I say
“alca-ish” I mean the ALCA (the Spanish acronym for the FTAA) and not to that
Al Qaeda organization, although the difference between them is not all that

should say in passing that the stupid and brutal crime committed in New York did
tremendous damage to everybody. It harmed not only the American people and
economy; it also accelerated the process of the world economic crisis, although
this was already on its way. It dealt a blow to all those groups we have spoken
about, groups of intellectuals, of economists, of people worried about
globalization, those who were waging a battle. It had a paralyzing effect
inside the United States where the role of those opposed to globalization
became much more difficult, where, given the prevailing anger and confusion,
they even ran the risk of being called terrorists. Perhaps, if this terrorist
attack had not happened, the Davos lot would not have been able to meet in New
York —they came up with that later, taking advantage of the situation. It affected
the meeting at Porto Alegre in Rio Grande del Sur which 100,000 people would
probably have attended but to which only 50,000 or 60,000 turned up, according
to estimates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

movements affected by the barbarity and stupidity of those acts which we
sincerely condemn because we have been giving these matters a great deal of
thought, and because we waged a war, which lasted 25 months, waged it
successfully, and I still cannot remember in the many battles that our Column 1
troops fought, from which all the others were derived, one single case of an
innocent civilian killed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Ours
was a liberation struggle and we treated our prisoners very respectfully, they
were not held prisoner for even 48 hours, 72 at the most. When we began to take
large numbers of prisoners we handed them over to the International Red Cross.
We gave our medicines to the injured and we released the prisoners immediately.
They were our arms suppliers, so it was only natural that we treated them well.
(Laughter.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

first, they struggled and fought back to the last bullet. They cost us lives,
they cost us military supplies. They thought we were going to kill them. Their
heads had been filled with such ideas and it was only our consistent behavior
that convinced them that the opposite was true. Then, once they felt they had lost
a battle, it was easier for them to stop fighting. There were some who
surrendered on three different occasions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
were not supplied with funds, or arms or anything from abroad. We had not even
met a Russian bureaucrat. No one brought us our ideas, our tactics. Engels once
said that ever since wide avenues had been built in Paris and breech-loading
rifles had been invented, insurrections had become impossible. I always
meditated on that and I did not agree because, if I had we would not have tried
to make a revolution. Actually, the objective conditions here were not all that
favorable —they were somewhat favorable, of course, as later events would show—
and the subjective conditions were not much better either. Dogmatism was rather
predominant in revolutionary thought and we were quite influenced by the
ideology of our neighbors to the North; it was the midst of the cold war.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Our
ideas were flexible about different kinds of struggles; we did not reject
anything out of hand. Combinations of armed struggle and a mass movement, or
capturing a fortress to give arms to the people, under the slogan of a
revolutionary general strike. The fact is that we worked on a formula for
taking power and yes, based on Marxist-Leninist ideas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>To Marx we owe the clear idea of what society
was. Before we had contact with those ideas, society seemed like a huge forest
to us and we were like someone lost in that forest. To Lenin we owe the
theories on the state. Both of them showed us class society, the history of
exploitation, historical materialism, but of course these were not doctrines to
be applied mathematically. When you try to apply them to one era or another,
you realize that they are much influenced by the events, which were taking
place when they were compound in a theory. However, many of their principles
are universal as far as the brief history of humanity goes, because what we
know about humanity and what can be called history and not legend, is not
really much. I think that the oldest history is 3,500 years old. What is 3,500
years in the history of our species? This species which has developed a
civilization and I subscribe completely to that Marxist concept, that
humanity’s pre-history will come to an end when the capitalist system
disappears. I do not forget that we have not yet even entered our history and
when some stupid people go around saying that this is the end of history they
are confusing events and concepts, they do not realize that we are reaching the
end of pre-history.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Well,
with pre-history come also barbarity and increasingly brutal forms of
plundering and ever more subtle and perfidious ways of stealing from the
masses. One sometimes feels envy for tribal times or for the age of the first
groups who lived in elementary forms of society because they were more free to
think, no one thought for them, not even the tribal medicine man or he who led
the rituals (Laughter). Today, the masses are practically prevented from
thinking, otherwise they would not be drinking Coca Cola in places where Coca Cola
had never been heard of and where they had much nicer soft drinks. They would
not be eating those famous McDonald’s burgers, and who knows what kind of meat
they are made from, because it has to change depending on where they are and
there may be some that even use cat meat or who knows what. (Laughter.) Yes,
yes, these are all attacks on customs, on cultures, on identities, on
civilization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
neoliberal globalization has brought with it a number of things, not only in
terms of the economy, culture and ethics, but in every sense, it prevents us
all from thinking. Some people do not bother to think: fashion is such and
such, long skirt, short skirt, the soap is such and such and so on, the soft
drink is this or that or this brand of whisky. And hardly anyone stops to
think, they read it in the papers, in the magazines, or they learn about it
from the ads on television or at the cinema. These are facts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
harbor the notion that we are reaching a decisive phase. When so many things
were said here, it caught my attention that nobody mentioned something as
disgustingly unfair as unequal terms of trade. Such words are hardly said any
more. We have already forgotten that if in 1949 a truck or a tractor was worth
so many tons of coffee, or so many tons of sugar or of any of the basic
commodities produced by our countries, today we have to give more and more of
those commodities. They have less and less purchasing power because it is not
only our money that has been devalued, our products have also been devalued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Everyone
knows that, it has been said, it has been written about and it is one form of
plundering. There are ever new forms of plundering, otherwise there would not
be so much hunger and so many calamities, so much poverty, so much extreme
poverty. All of those figures that have been quoted here have an obvious cause,
a system of plundering. At least while the socialist camp and the USSR existed
—with all of the well-deserved criticism than can be made of them— the others
were afraid. The emergence of a workers’ revolution in 1917 meant that the big
companies, the big monopolies and governments were a little more careful, had a
bit more respect for the unions, a bit more respect for the working class, and
so subsidies and other concessions were obtained, which have been swept away
little by little over the last few years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

is scarcely 10 years since the USSR disappeared and since there is now only one
hegemonic superpower, nobody seems to care about what might happen or about
social injustice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If
you analyze the figures for unionized workers, you will discover that they have
gone down to 15%, to 10%, to 7%. The workers’ movement has been destroyed, the
same as many parties or they have been transformed leaving society increasingly
helpless. The monopoly over the mass media is greater than ever. The media no
longer cover just one national area, they cover every country in the world and
they can broadcast in many languages, even in dialects and the same program can
be heard simultaneously by a minority in one country and in another language by
a minority in other countries, in the United States and outside the United
States on cable TV, by satellite, etcetera, etcetera. It is a flood. If one
spoke of a universal flood, it would be wrong, but in any case one could speak
of two floods: the one in the Bible and this universal flood of information,
which is often transformed into a universal flood of lies, a universal flood of
deceit. And I said often, not always, it is only fair to note there are
exceptions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>We remember that there were many
domestic and international television networks that gave coverage to our battle
for the return of little Elián who was so cruelly and unfairly kidnapped. And
other events have been broadcast, not only during that time but also part of
our battle of ideas and our later battle against the murderous Cuban Adjustment
Act —I will not expand on that law— the Helms-Burton Act, the Torricelli Act,
the blockade, the economic war, all kinds of amendments that have been passed
to make the blockade worse, especially when the socialist camp collapsed and we
lost our supplier of certain products, we lost fuel, we lost markets. We lost
almost everything overnight. One has to wonder how our people could withstand
it. I will not even try to explain it. I will only say that it was able to
withstand a double blockade.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

will limit myself to saying that a political awareness, ideas and the work the

despite the blockade, which they pitifully call embargo, which is like calling

anything at all to the United States or its industries abroad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

review things, all the institutions have been mentioned, of one sort or
another, all the abuses that they commit. The Free Trade Agreements have been
mentioned, I already said, and it has already been very eloquently said here
that all of those currently super-developed and super-rich nations developed
without FTAAs and without WTOs. They developed by protecting their industries
and not by making them compete with those who had all the technology because
they had universities, research centers, their own researchers. And a
significant number of them developed by stealing the best minds from Third
World countries where these did not have the smallest chance of having access
to a laboratory. They offered them opportunities, not just economic, since
people are not moved by economic motivations alone, people are also moved by a
vocation or by the desire to do research, to work, to create. What
opportunities did they have?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
know that more than half a million Latin Americans, graduates of Latin American
universities have emigrated to industrialized countries, mostly to the United
States. Until recently, until a year ago, a few months before the crisis, there
was talk of hiring 200,000 Latin Americans to work in the high technology
industry. They meant university graduates, engineers, etcetera.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Now with an FTAA and a WTO they want
to make us compete with their technology, with their developed, automated
industries. The rest can always grow fruit, they want to go back to that time
when it was said that man was a fruit collector. That is what they want to do
to Latin Americans with their FTAA: have us grow mangos and some vegetables
which might be a bit more expensive to grow in California and some other states
because over there wages are fifteen times higher than those paid in our
countries. Yet, and the Mexicans know this well, the women who work in the
maquiladoras in the north of their country earn a fourteen times higher wage
when they go work in the United States than when they work in the Mexican
maquiladoras, in the northern region. As compared to southern Mexico it might
not be fourteen times higher, the wage paid in the United States for the same
work might be thirty to forty times higher than that paid in the maquiladoras
which are close to the borders with Central American countries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Which
is why we see that they are growing an amazing amount or that exports are
growing while they only pay the meager salary of industries that do not even
pay taxes and where the domestic component, generally speaking, does not exceed
2% or 3%. What they are exporting is the sweat of the workers, which is why
many people lose their lives there trying to emigrate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

year 400 or 500 people die on the U.S.-Mexico border —it is already close to

reports on that every day and this is never mentioned, except by some, and let
us say, bold people who sometimes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do</i>

after the overthrow of the military dictatorship in Venezuela, in February,
1958. The Revolution triumphed in January 1959.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

knows about the extensive plundering that went on in that country, all the
waste. Even the ice used to cool down whisky was made from Scottish water and
came in little plastic bags, so as not to commit the sin of mixing Venezuelan
water with whisky that was made with Scottish water. This was called a model
democracy. If you ask: How many children complete their sixth grade? They would
tell you less than 50%. And how many complete high school? Even less. Has
illiteracy been wiped out? No, it is still there. They speak of 15% or 20%,
which does not include semi-illiterate people or functionally illiterate
people, another category that must be considered. It adds up to millions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

interest could certain sectors have or what interest could the reactionaries
and the oligarchs have in teaching the people to read and write? They were
afraid of the people knowing how to read and write and that explains the huge
numbers, although, of course, they are not comparable with those in Africa.
There are countries in Africa with an 87% illiteracy rate and maybe 15% or 16%
of the population with access to schools. Do not just talk about illiterates,
talk about those who have no access to schools, those who only get to sixth
grade and then see if you can talk of industrial development, the Internet and
the training of researchers and scientists. Who are they trying to fool with
these facts? It is incredible how they try to fool the peoples and say that
they live in a democratic system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

plundering does not exist, but you are all well aware that one needs a computer
to add up all the money that has been stolen in our hemisphere since the Cuban
Revolution came into existence; the number of vanished people in this
hemisphere since the Revolution came into existence. In Guatemala alone they
were 100,000 and the number of deaths was more than 200,000. The category of
“prisoner” has not existed there since they invaded the country with a
mercenary expedition similar to the one in the Bay of Pigs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

think what would have happened to us! But by then we already had 400,000
weapons. We would have been, perhaps, the Viet Nam of this hemisphere. It was a
matter of life and death to have not given them time to establish a beachhead
and to drive them out in less than 72 hours. They underestimated our people, as
they usually do. We did not yet have an organized army, according to the rules
for what are considered to be prepared and well-trained armed forces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

the revolutionary war had been won with people who had received nothing more
than theoretical training. I cannot remember a single case of the thousands who
fought afterwards with our guerrilla army --and there were not that many-- who
entered the fray having fired a single shot in training. Everything was based
of geometrical methods, without firing any shots, because we could not waste
our scarce ammunition like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
trade of fighting was learned, with good tactics, against powerful well armed
troops trained by the United States, that had a pretty good air force, good
coordination between those in the air and those advancing on the ground and
modern tanks, good communications. They had everything we did not have, except
politics. They went around burning houses, murdering campesinos, stealing from
everyone, thus, they did our political work; they were even our arms suppliers,
our best political commissars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

people caricaturize us and some people think that we were sitting up on a hill
talking to campesinos about Marxist theory, and the Land Reform Law and twenty
other things. What those campesinos understood was that we treated them well,
showing great respect to them, to their families, that we paid for everything
we bought from them. Also, since the area was blockaded, we confiscated the
large herds to share out the meat and to give animals to those who, in spite of
the bombing and everything else, did not leave the area where we operated.
Finally, we managed to win with those tactics and concrete actions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

wants to do about the way to overthrow oppressive and plundering regimes that
is up to each person. I am simply saying what we did at a given moment and how
the country after, faced with such a powerful enemy, withstood the harassment,
the aggressions, and the terrorism. Take good note of that, terrorism, but I am
not going to expand on that, because that would take a long time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

But this country had to be blockaded, because this country enforced a land
reform and this was the country in Latin America where the big U.S.
transnationals owned the most land. Those companies were the owners of most of
the land and of the best land, which they had obtained at negligible prices and
exploited for over half a century. And they were also the owners of our public
services, owners of the railways, owners of the mines, owners of the most
important industries. The Land Reform Law was one of the first laws and from
that moment on we were condemned to be destroyed, just as they were doomed in
Guatemala after they carried out an agrarian reform.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
was more radical here because some of those companies owned 200,000 hectares of
land and in the first Land Reform Law we established a maximum of 1,340
hectares, if they were well cultivated, or a maximum of 402 hectares if it
involved extensive agriculture or fallow land. This included compensation in
government bonds. That was the first Land Law. To a powerful and influential
company that owned 200,000 hectares, that was irreverent. The country held its
ground and held its ground for all that time and carried out its mission, then
worse times came, and the country held its ground and continued with its
mission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Suffice it to say that when what we
called Special Period began, 30,000 additional family doctors joined our
medical services in ten years —30,000 family doctors. Today, our people have a
family doctor within 100, 150 or 200 meters from their homes. In the
countryside, the doctor is a little farther away, but the doctor is there and
lives there. These are services that no developed country could even dream of
having. Medical services in most of the world are totally commercialized. It is
not like that in Cuba, where more than 60,000 doctors provide medical care for
free, with all costs covered by the State. We have 2,500 doctors working abroad
in comprehensive health care programs in Third World countries without charging

that is, if they raise the funds needed. As of now, one billion has been
offered in response to the UN call and no more and I was saying this afternoon
that at least 200 billion is needed to fight AIDS because it is growing like a
weed. In 19 years no vaccine has been discovered, no one is interested in a
vaccine. The big pharmaceutical transnationals are interested not in prevention
but in drug treatment and that is why medical services are so expensive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of wealth by the bureaucrats, and thanks to the principles of that
oft-mentioned institution called the IMF and of the free flow of capital, neither
short-term nor lazy, the confiscators made off with all the money it was

times greater than that of Cuba and hundreds of thousands of illiterate people
and people who receive no medical care because they practice the doctrine of
neoliberalism and their GDP includes the output of numerous free zones.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the whole world wants to be a free zone. They have made countries compete with

commercialized and a large part of education is commercialized, all recreational
activities are commercialized. The work of our 60-something thousand doctors;
the work of about 25,000 teachers and professors; the work of sports coaches,
since these are all free services, do not contribute anything [to GDP], they
are not counted in by the national income accounting methodology. Perhaps the
latest Nobel Prize winner, Mr. Stiglitz, would say that this is asymmetrical
information. Thus everything is misleading, even the way of measuring GDP,
simply because in our country those services are free while only wages and some
other expenses show in the statistics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

lie. I have already explained that here when there were only half of those who

domestic product does not tell very much. What tell more are the quality of

comes from having services guaranteed, whereas, even up there, in the North,
where our very rich neighbor lies, more than 40 million people lack medical
insurance and those who are supposedly insured are so only partially, not

have to be tied to a debt, which eats up an increasing amount of their national

they pay less and less for, grow mangos, grow avocados, cut down the forests to
export wood; hand over products that are not renewable, all the gas and all the
petroleum possible; subject any small producer, any small shopkeeper to
competition from the big chains of outlets which sweep everything aside; give
up any idea of having an airline, there are countries where there is none left;

slavery, whose price was a bloody war, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and

contract since they provide the markets. And, when all is said and done, we
calculate what the advantages or drawbacks of a given private investment are. There
are some investors who do not want to enter joint ventures; they want to own
one hundred per cent of the company. Actually, there have been very few of such

not so wonderful, since it has not been able to revalue a single currency in
the Third World. That sad stage of the special period was sad but glorious and
taught us a great deal. In 1994 our peso had been devalued to a rate of 150
pesos to the dollar and in five years we had revalued our peso from 150 to 20

was halted because there was always a greater demand for pesos, since many
things can only be bought for pesos. Moreover, pesos earn a higher interest
rate in medium term deposits, around 50% more. Yes, 50% more than our
convertible peso. For we have a convertible peso, but it is not like the one in

electricity computers use.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

monetary policy has not been subject to these tragedies you speak of, that is,
what if the interest rate, what if the Fund promised us so much and did not
come through, what if the currency is devalued. Which one has not been
devalued? Which one is safe?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is obvious that, in theory, we are perfectly well aware that a common currency
in Latin America would be better, but we are far from having the conditions
necessary for resolving our problems with a single currency. What will save us,
what will allow us not to replace our currencies with the US dollar, what will
prevent money fleeing away from us? And I do not know how it will stop fleeing,
or how it can stop fleeing, or how to prevent it from devaluing. This is the
actual situation, the problems are much more serious, and much more complex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Interesting
things have been said here, including those said by Professor Stiglitz, the
Nobel Prize winner for 2001. We are not economic theoreticians but our struggle
has forced us to pay attention to much of what happens to the economy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
have heard some excellent presentations. Professor Stiglitz was relatively
cautious here —one always has to be very careful what one says in the Cuban
capital— but he has written some excellent articles, some of which we are
familiar with: his famous foreword to Polanyi’s work; he is the economist who
defended other positions at the time of Bretton Woods. It is interesting to
look at what Mr. Stiglitz says, his criticisms of the Monetary Fund, and how
clearly he blames it for the tragedy many countries are living through.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He
has another article which is called “What I Learned from the Southeast Asian
Crisis” where he reviews, country by country, the different criteria and ideas
of those who were in favor of alleviating the situation for those countries
that were in crisis and most of all, how and why they were in crisis. He also
explains that they all developed on the basis of strong protectionist
measures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But, then they were forced
off this line, they were forced to free up everything and so they were left
without hard currency, they were left with no reserves to fend off speculative
attacks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
was an irreverent man called Mahatir who came up with another formula and
challenged them. But he safeguarded resources; he gave them better protection
in the critical situation. Others lost everything, and that allowed many U.S.
transnationals to buy industries in those countries at rock bottom prices.
This, in addition to their vehement defense of the insane free movement of
capital and the total release of the exchange rates. In other words, complete
deregulation, as you call it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Where
is the future for those countries? Was there by any chance a minimum planning?
I am not suggesting a GOSPLAN for the world. I can be bold and say that it
could have happened earlier, before they learned to do things well, actually,
with other concepts. I have the moral right to say so having seen what our
people have done in these 43 years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
is not even a minimum of coordination. They put every country to work making
chips for the Internet, or for television and get prices of up to a dollar and
whenever there is overproduction they are reduced to five cents. Or they put
everybody to work making television sets, refrigerators or household gadgets,
as we say in the vernacular. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>They
have the technology and the capacity to produce unlimited amounts of anything;
it is just that there is no purchasing power to buy everything that these
industries could produce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
to top it off, they start producing cars in Thailand or in Indonesia, and luxury
cars at that, a kind of Mercedes Benz, when half of the Japanese automobile
industry is paralyzed. So, the more technology they develop, the greater the
productivity of labor, the fewer jobs there are, the higher the unemployment
and therefore more crises. I would like China to join the WTO now, to see who
can beat the Chinese at producing anything. For now, we have come out on top.
We would never think of building a TV tube factory, but we have bought a
million Chinese television sets instead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For
us television is an educational tool, a cultural tool. So much can be done with
it! We are teaching languages to people en masse with programs we call
University for All and we are getting great results.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
very week or next week the review begins. Since university admission depends on
school history and various tests, we have set up a program to go over the basic
subjects on whom students are required to take tests and improve their
preparation. Previously, only those families with a higher educational level or
better income could pay review classes for their children because all families
want their children to go to university.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
have said that we are ashamed of what we have accomplished, because one day we
discovered that not all children born in this country have exactly the same
opportunities. It was by researching and further investigating into those
problems related to social justice that we have discovered how much is left to
do, and this after a number of years of revolutionary struggle, and of having
accomplished, possibly, ten times more in the social field than any other
country in Latin America. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>I said in a Congress of Latin
American journalists that we felt ashamed of what we had accomplished when we
thought about the things we could have done and which, because of our
ignorance, we had not done before and which we are doing today. This includes
more than 70 social development programs. One of them is the University for
All, and that is not a trifling thing. Another one is to reduce class size in primary
schools to 20 students per teacher and that is not even the ideal number. In
Havana in two years time, we are going to reduce the numbers from an average of
37 students per teacher to a maximum of 20. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>We have brought television classes
to 1944 schools that did not have them because they did not have electricity.
We solved that problem with solar panels and now they are installing another
solar panel to feed the computers, they will be finished in a couple of weeks.
Not one of the 1944 schools has been left out of this program. Twenty-one of
those schools have only one student —they live in isolated places, perhaps the
child of a forest warden— but that student has a certified teacher who is a
university graduate in primary education, a solar panel and a television, maybe
one of those Chinese, which use 60 watts, they are very economical and have an
excellent picture and now a computer which the graduate teacher will use. These
teachers have taken an intensive course to be able to teach computer sciences
in primary school. They had already studied teaching methodology, therefore,
with a 174-hour course they can now teach the computer course approved for
children. The teachers, too, will follow-up on these courses and improve their
income.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The computer science teachers in the
Havana primary schools --everything in the capital is always more difficult--
are taking an 800-hour course. But these are not actually teachers, because we
have a shortage of those.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They are
grade-11 youngsters from senior high teacher training schools.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Right now we have almost 600 video
screening rooms, equipped with 29-inch TVs and a solar panel, in 600 villages
or small towns, which do not have electricity. Thus we are giving access to
television to every inhabitant in the country. They go (to the screening rooms)
where their discipline is admirable. They do not go there to drink rum, and it
is a real event when the programs arrive. There will be 700 in the first stage
and approximately 700 more to come. By the end of this year, all the little
villages, there are almost 1500 of them, with 15 or more dwellings will have
one of these screening rooms. These are built with very little resources.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>How
much did it cost us to get solar panels into the 1944 schools that were not
hooked up to the electricity grid? What was the most economical way? Solar
panels. Total number of solar panels: 1944. Cost: 2,200,000 USD. Some people,
in certain countries, make off with that much in one day, or in a week. Is two
million two hundred thousand very much money?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Getting
computers into all of these same places is a little more expensive, due to
electricity, because some of them have more than 40 students and need more than
1 kilowatt every day. So then a double panel is required and that costs 1900 USD.
Around 2.5 million USD have already been spent on this program. So we can say:
every child in the country from the age of five on has access to television
programs, which are an excellent audiovisual medium, especially if there is a
teacher as well, because the audiovisual tools are not there to take the place
of the teacher. There are some subjects where we have a shortage of teachers,
like English and some others, so we have to find someone there who can help.
However, we offer those courses by television.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
now have a third television channel just for education, which reaches a third
of the population. What we have done so far has been done with the two national
channels, which contribute six hours daily each. On Sundays one provides two
hours and the other two hours for educational programs. This time is well used
for various seminars, it might be about painting, dancing, writing skills or
other subjects. That is, fairly sophisticated knowledge is being made available
to the population.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

I was showing Pérez Esquivel the opinions collected yesterday after the round
table on the Argentine problem. On each of these subjects we collect between
3,000 and 5,000 spontaneous opinions and it is impressive what our people have
learned in two years. You can talk about the Monetary Fund, the World Bank, you
can talk about a whole number of subjects which our people knew nothing about
two or three years ago. Obviously, if the subject matter is complicated, the
panelists are advised to explain any technical terms they use.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

these programs, like University for All, a one-hour English class via

that is 1.8 cents per person. <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>You can see it is very inexpensive.
If each lesson in a course is broadcast three times a day, so that those
receiving the course can watch at the time most convenient for them – whether
at 7:00 in the morning, 2:00 in the afternoon or 11:00 at night – the cost to
the state is 5.4 cents of a dollar per person, for the whole course. And those
who receive the entire course spend eight cents on electricity and an
additional 25 cents, which is the cost in hard currency of the written
materials distributed. In total, 33 cents of a dollar for 160 hours of classes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
have put technology at the service of education and culture for the masses.
There is no commercial advertising, there never has been. The only commercials
are public service messages, urging people not to drink, not to smoke, offering
information to parents about how to better care for their children. There is no
commercial advertising of any kind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
you all know, television programs in your countries are constantly interrupted
by commercials. At the peak moment in a program, at the most dramatic point, they
break for a commercial. That is unheard of here. Thus, we can put this
technology to the best possible use, and at very low costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Pérez
Esquivel did us the honor of mentioning the 75,000 young people who are being
paid a salary to study. These are not students enrolled in the regular school
system. What is essential is to ensure that no one completes ninth grade and
then, for one reason or another, does not go on to study further or work. In
some cases, it is because a 16 or 17-year old girl gets married and leaves
school. In other cases, there are other reasons, related to the family, the way
they are raised, and many other factors that we have studied carefully and will
continue to study.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
now know precisely what we have to do to ensure that none of these young people
leave the school system. We need to work with the families, and work with the
young people, trying to motivate them. We have learned a fair amount about
this. I talked about all of these two days ago, but many of you were not here then.
These are young people between the ages of 17 and 30, in the ninth-grade
category; they all have at least a ninth grade education. Some of them are
senior high graduates; we expect the ninth-grade education category to
disappear in a few years. And there are 75,000 young people involved in the
program, because they are all we have in that situation. If there were 100,000
of them, we could still do it, or if there were 120,000. And it does not cost
us anything. We pay them a salary that helps them to resolve a lot of problems,
and if we do not offer them a full-time, permanent professional job, we provide
them with training, and they will be provided with suitable jobs, as they are
made available. Not all the provinces are the same, since some have a certain
amount of development in the tourism sector, for example, while others have
other industries. They all vary in terms of the employment available.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

we are dealing with a mother of three children. Sitting over there, in the
third row, during a students' congress, there was a young woman from the
province of Guantánamo who has three children. She was the happiest woman in
the world, and she has not missed a single class. The average attendance rate
at these schools is 95%.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is incredible to see what can be done, and what it costs us with an exchange
rate of 20 to 1; the results are such that you would find it hard to believe,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Now,
just look at the confidence shown by our people. When there was a change in
trends at our currency exchange bureaus, and more dollars than pesos were being
bought, we felt the need to provide the public with information and guidance.
And as a result of that, the situation did not last even two days more. That is
how the people trust the banks, because the money people have in savings
accounts has never been tampered with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

were some rumors claiming that the currency exchange bureaus would be shut
down, but the people were given assurance that they would remain open. They
were also ensured that the prices for goods sold in pesos would remain

freely set them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

from the different municipalities, and they will work in facilities close to

today? (Yes, they tell him.) She is a very good principal and they know it.
(Applause.) And they are very motivated. They are not participating because
they are in the tenth grade, there are still very young. There are other
schools where the students are senior high graduates, and these students are
involved in quality control. And then there are also the schools for training
social workers, another source of employment we have created. There is 7000
senior high school graduates enrolled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

education will be vastly expanded. There will be part-time university courses
taught in the different municipalities, just as we are doing with the young
people aged 17 to 30, in senior high school classrooms, which are free from
5:00 p.m. onwards. There are classes from 5:30 to 8:30 four days a week, and
now they are asking for a fifth day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

labs there, the software needed for whatever you need to do. They will be
provided with general knowledge and language classes, so they can later enroll
in university.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

need to leave the municipality where they live, since there are limitations
with transportation. We are changing the methods we use to simply and
economically increase opportunities for university studies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

are tremendous strengths that we have gradually discovered. The successes in
all these new programs derive from the thirst for knowledge inherent in human
beings. Why should they be provided with subsidies? Why not create schools? And
if we cannot provide them with a job within a relatively short time, we will
raise their income the next year, and we can even create a new profession, the
profession of being learned. They can continue to study until they become
learned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

an increase in drug use, a terrible scourge from with we have been spared. And
I do not know what they are going to do now that the problem of Ecstasy and
similar drugs is on the rise. Statistics show that the use of these drugs among
young people is growing, it has doubled and tripled, and they are cheaper than
cocaine. It is a question of education, and we are focusing on educators, not
transmitters of knowledge, in line with the principles of a great Cuban
philosopher from the first half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, who said,
“Anyone can teach; only those who are like living gospel can educate.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had reached 8%, and by the end of the year 2000 it had decreased to 5.4%. Today
it is 4.1%, and by the end of this year it will be between 3% and 3.5%, unless

was a special day for me. Our minister-president of the central bank explained
some very interesting facts, when he addressed speculation and the total lack
of a connection between the real economy and the speculative economy. It is
impossible to forget that the value of stocks on the stock markets of the
industrialized countries is practically equal to the annual gross domestic
product of the entire world economy. The inflated value of these stocks was
31.2 trillion dollars, while the worldwide gross product in goods and services
was 31.3 trillion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Look
at how far things have gone. In the United States as well, where the gross
domestic product is around 10 trillion dollars, the value of stocks on the
stock markets is 1.3 times greater. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He
provided another rather surprising piece of information when he spoke of how
the price of stocks of some stock market groups in the United States had
increased by 570% between 1981 and 1999, while actual profits had only
increased by 61%.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Is
any more evidence necessary to prove that the economy no longer exists? What
economy are you talking about? Now, really!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Economists
will have to become experts in gambling and guessing games, because the economy
has become a casino. Economists today have become employees in the casino of
the world economy, and it is very important for these employees to know how the
casino works. We already know that three trillion US dollars are involved in
speculative operations every day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
remember that in Copenhagen, during a summit meeting on social problems, a
rather prestigious European leader I met told me with despair about the 1.2
trillion US dollars involved in speculative operations every day. In the ten
years that have passed since then, that figure has grown to three trillion
dollars a day, while on the other hand, total worldwide trade operations amount
to only around eight trillion dollars a year. That means that every three days
there is a greater flow of money for speculative operations than that needed to
cover world trade for a whole year. What kind of economy is that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So
you have to be an economist, an expert in political science, an expert in
gambling, and on top of all that, an astrologer, in order to interpret events.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Sometimes
you start to despair when you see the same phenomenon repeating itself over and
over again, and it seems that we are powerless to do anything about it, but I
am far from pessimistic. New worlds will not spring from anyone’s head. As you
know, those who have dreamed of such things since the time of Plato are called
Utopians. But not everyone is a Utopian. Jose Martí complained bitterly of
this, and he said: “To those who call me a dreamer, I say that<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>today’s dreams will be tomorrow’s
realities.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
am speaking to you as a dreamer who has lived through the experience of seeing
dreams become realities, and who has lived through the shame of seeing that the
realities could have been greater. Although our dreams were ambitious, I speak
with the shame of not having dreamed, when we were first beginning, of all of
the things we are now making realities. (Applause)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
said earlier that there was a third decisive element missing. Not just
awareness, not just knowledge: there was a third essential thing needed when
you dream of changing the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
brief history I spoke of is full of dreamers who did not see their dreams come
true, because in addition to dreams, knowledge, awareness, desire and good
will, the proper objective conditions are needed, and the objective conditions
are brought about by history. There will never be profound changes, and there
never have been, if they are not preceded by grave crises. That is the key.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Great
solutions have only ever emerged from great crises. This is what I say to those
who have asked what is to be done. One of the things that we can do is to be
prepared, to sow ideas, to build awareness. With the optimism of those of us
who believe our views are based on real facts, we are not even frightened by
the prospect of an FTAA coming along and swallowing the whole of Latin America
and the Caribbean. That actually reminds me of a biblical fable –since I had to
study Sacred History every year, which is what they called the Old and New
Testament. The fable was about a prophet named Jonas, if I remember correctly,
whom did a whale swallow. But the whale could not digest him, and he emerged
fully intact from the whale’s belly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
believe in realities, and I believe that in the near future, even if we are
swallowed, the 500 million of us living in Latin America and the Caribbean will
emerge intact from the belly of a whale that will never be able to digest us.
(Applause)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
so we should not harbor any fears. We must believe in the laws of history, the
laws we have come to know through reflecting on them, through making
deductions, through study and observation of the realities. The problem with
the system, as has already been said, is that it simply cannot sustain itself,
and anything that cannot sustain itself eventually collapses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Right
here, when we were gathered for the Sao Paulo Forum, from this very same
podium, I said to the Argentines: Do not worry, do not spend to much time
thinking about a strategy. Do not despair searching for a strategy; it is not
necessary. That government will collapse on its own; you do not even need to
blow it. (Laughter) That is what I told them. And I had said the same thing
even before then, because we had foreseen these realities in our analysis and
discussions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>We studied the history leading up to
1929; the difference between 1929 and what was happening now, when the stock
markets were more inflated then ever. What guarantee was there that it would
not collapse and the bubble would not burst, with even worse consequences this
time, given that the role played in the world by that country was greater than
ever, and 50% of U.S. citizens had their money invested in these stocks, which
had become so inflated that some that had cost 1000 dollars were now worth
800,000 dollars? They had grown 800 times in value. It was outrageous, insane,
it could not be sustained. Nobody knew when it would begin, or how it would
begin. But it would certainly begin, even without the terrorist attack. What
the terrorist attack did was to speed up the process, as you all know so well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Therefore,
I have absolutely no doubt. That is why I began by recalling the efforts made
with regard to the debt in 1985. The system managed to gain a bit of time by
inventing new formulas, Brady bonds, and so on. It gained a bit of time. All
that it could manage to do was to gain a little bit of time when that was still
possible. But now there is not much time left to gain. Things have now become
so complicated that they have very few possibilities left, and every solution
carries the cost of aggravating the future damage. Giving things away? They are
not going to give anything away. Those who control the world economy are fundamentalists
about this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
was speaking about something that they have ignored until now, and that they
are perhaps beginning to understand: the fact that we are facing a crisis. And
I said that no solution has ever sprung forth from anyone’s head, or from
ideas, or from propositions; solutions must come up from realities, and they
must come up from a crisis. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
crises do not come when people want them to come, either. They simply come, and
sometimes they come fast, because events now travel faster than ever, too. Do
not believe for a minute that today’s empire can last as long as the Roman
Empire did, or the British Empire later, or the other empires or semi-empires
in history. Today, events occur at a faster pace. You could almost say that
they move at the speed of light, at the same speed with which operations can be
carried out from one side of the world to another, in a fraction of a second,
or the way communications take place over the Internet in a fraction of a
second. This is the speed at which events move today, and they cannot move any
other way, because this is the speed at which science and technology have
developed. This much History shows. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Without
going too far back, the French Revolution could not have come about 50 years
earlier or 50 years later than it did. There was an absolute monarchy, very
well consolidated, a feudal system. There are about 10 or 12 volumes by Jaurés
that explain in detail the habits, laws and regulations of feudalism that made
it impossible for that system to survive. Theoreticians came along, as the
crisis became more obvious, but it was not the theoreticians who made the
revolution. They formulated ideas and principles, but it was hunger and the
unsustainable situation that led to the revolution at that precise moment in
time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>No
one had ever heard the names of those famous leaders who would have never even
been mentioned if the crisis had not erupted, and along with the crisis came
some of the main leaders of that revolution. Some had been priests or bishops,
others were bourgeois or intellectuals, but they were all brilliant. And almost
all of them, as well, lost their heads one by one: the Girondists, the
Jacobins, Danton, Marat, Robespierre, the moderates, the radicals. And then
came Napoleon’s coup d’état. No one would have ever heard of any of these
figures. It is clear that crises not only bring changes, they also bring
leaders, they bring the actors who lead or participate. And things never happen
in exactly the same way in any other place. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
have talked here about the people who organize the grassroots committees, the
people who organize the protests and rally and communicate on the Internet, the
masses that move with tremendous and surprising force. Changes also have
precursors. Many of you here are young people, but you have already accumulated
a great deal of knowledge and you have showed that here. Something I found
truly impressive was the round table discussion on the crisis. It will be
broadcast on Sunday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>They
were going to do a program on that today, but they had to do another one.
Yesterday’s roundtable did not have to be repeated by the participants for
television; it will be broadcast in its entirety, with the spontaneity with
which the participants spoke at it. It was filmed and will be broadcast. Our
people are learning more everyday. People with great talent, erudition,
experience offered brilliant explanations. We shall publish all of it in a
special newspaper supplement, and print maybe 200,000 or 300,000 copies. We do
not do things in dribs and drabs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
was a discussion of Ramonet’s book at the Karl Marx Theater last Sunday, with
6000 people there. There were students there – many of whom have been through
here – from the social workers training school and others, and the people involved
in the battle against the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Aedes aegypti</i>
mosquito and the dengue outbreaks. There were 3000 of the 6000 students from
the student social work brigades there. Since these courses are new, we only
have around 1000 graduates, and now 7000 new students have enrolled. We have
used the strength of the university students.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>Between July 15 and August 6, in 16 days, 6000 of them visited
505,000 households in the country’s capital, gathering opinions on the most
varied subjects, taking notes on everything and leaving room for the people in
the households they visited to express their thoughts on any subject they
wanted to add to the subjects already covered; there were over 30 subjects. It
took four months and 300 computers –run by the students themselves– to compile
the results. In other words, a huge amount of information and knowledge that
can only be obtained in this way is being gathered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I can point to another fact, which is the
strength of the country that lies with the youth, the students, the workers, the
women organized and united; and with all this strength it can do anything. They
weighed 2.2 million children under 15 years of age, to know which ones might be
undersize or underweight for their age. Then, with this information, it would
be possible to provide individualized treatment to all those who needed it.
They also learned about the factors that could contribute to a child not
receiving adequate nutrition during the first three years of life. Such
children generally begin pre-school with a lower intellectual capacity than
those who have been adequately nourished, because really, children must be
cared for from the time they are in their mother’s womb.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
should not matter if one family has a higher income than another, or if some
parents are better educated and learned than others, or if some families live
in a three-bedroom apartment while others sleep six to a room. We cannot wait
until hundreds of thousands or a million new homes are constructed to change
material living conditions. The issue of marginality is not simply one of
living in a neighborhood with makeshift housing. There are other factors
involved. We cannot change things by building housing only, but rather through
the kinds of programs we are implementing, which have a decisive importance in
the search for the greatest justice possible. This justice did not exist
totally, but it will exist, and it will exist within a short time, I can assure
you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For
next year, Verrier, we can publish a leaflet with a description of all these
programs. Some have already been completed, and with a minimum of resources.
The important thing is wanting to do it. But in order to do it, you need to
have the strength to do it, and the strength is there, with the masses. This is
what I have to say to those who had doubts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If
you want another moment in history, well, in the 17<sup>th</sup> year of last
century, the conditions were created for a major social revolution, the Russian
Revolution. Before that there was the Mexican Revolution, after Porfirio Díaz.
Under those tremendous conditions, the crisis was set off, and the leaders
emerged with the crisis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Before
that, in Haiti, the French Revolution itself unleashed a social revolution –not
a socialist one– because it was impossible to sustain a regime of 300,000
slaves dominated by 30,000 French colonists. This could not last much longer,
and one day it all fell apart, with the leaders of the slave uprising emerging
from among the slaves themselves. Nobody had ever heard of Toussaint Louverture
or the others. And 30,000 French soldiers, led by one of the most brilliant
officers in the famous Napoleonic army, could not crush the slaves’ revolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
had major consequences, because many of those French colonists came to our
island and Cuba became a slave society, a producer of coffee first and sugar
cane later. The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>criollos</i>, or
Cuban-born Spaniards, were the owners of the lands inherited from the first
colonizers, while the Spanish controlled trade, administration and public
security. And the whole system was held up by philosophies, beliefs and
principles that seemed immutable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
very independence of the Americas did not come until there was a major crisis.
There were precursors, individuals who had distributed declarations on the
rights of man, who spoke about freedom, equality and brotherhood, which have
still not really been established in any country on Earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Monarchist
beliefs were still strong in our hemisphere. But when the famous Napoleonic
army occupied Spain, and a Bourbon was dethroned to be replaced by Napoleon’s
brother, the Spanish people upraised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
first juntas from the Spanish colonies of this hemisphere responded more to a
sentiment of loyalty to Spain. There were a few exceptions, like those led by
Bolívar and others in Venezuela. That was where Miranda was active, after
taking part in the struggle for the independence of the United States and
fighting in the battles of that revolution; he was named the first president of
Venezuela. The struggles became revolutions for independence, waged over the
course of over 15 years, until the last shots were fired in the battle of
Ayacucho.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Neither
Sucre, nor Bolívar, nor any other of those figures would have made it into the
history books 20 years earlier or 20 or 30 years later. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Our
own wars of independence began in the same way, at the right moment. The
subjective factors can only move too quickly or too slowly, but they start and
develop, and subjective factors can have a decisive influence. It is possible
for a revolution like the Bolshevik revolution to end up like it did, although
it was authentic. And I totally agree that when the revolution expected in all
the industrialized countries did not take place, the revolutionaries did not
give up but decided to build socialism in a single country, which was in fact
in contradiction to the theories of Marx, and yet they did not hesitate to do
so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Many
things could be said, different views and opinions. When the balance of powers
in the world could have been broken, it was prevented by subjective factors. And
in the end, we too have carried out the Revolution in a single country, here,
among all the countries of Latin America, where with the exception of Mexico,
all of the other so-called governments, and I must use that term, joined with
the United States against Cuba. Sometimes we blame governments for problems,
when in fact neither independence nor governments exist anymore. Their power is
being ever more diminished to a minimum. The political parties in our
hemisphere have been completely discredited. They have been destroyed by the
established political and economic order, and this dates back a long way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Almost
200 years have passed since the first struggle for independence, and how much
has changed? What has happened to the indigenous peoples? What has happened to
the slave descendants? What has happened to the descendants of the colonizers
themselves, or the mestizos and all the others? The world knows what has
happened to them, as it knows about the infant mortality, illiteracy, poverty,
unemployment and other calamities you have discussed here. No one is ignorant
of these things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
are very much aware of the conditions in which we undertook the Revolution.
During the first years, of course, the existence of a socialist camp was very
useful to us. I would not call what they had real socialism, but rather virtual
socialism, because something imported is not the same as something
autochthonous. A political process or revolution achieved through artificial
insemination, or cloning, is not the real thing. And what really happened was a
sort of cloning of the experience of a country that jumped from feudalism to
socialism, where 80% of the people were ignorant peasants at the time of the
revolution; a handful of the proletariat in the least industrialized country in
Europe, which, as a result of World War II, spread to encompass the most
underdeveloped, agricultural region of Europe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
now reach the stage when the United States emerged from that war as an
invincible power, with all of its industry intact and 80% of the world’s gold.
This allowed it to impose the infamous Bretton Woods Agreement, until
two-thirds of that gold was misappropriated and squandered, and it had only 10
billion troy ounces left, with a known value of 35 dollars, and a mechanism that
guaranteed the stability of this price by buying gold when it was in abundance
and selling when it was scarce. It worked like a precisely well-oiled machine
until after the Viet Nam war, when 500 billion dollars were spent tax-free and
only a third of the original gold remained, bringing an end to the gold
standard. Gold was replaced with paper, with the bills printed by the
Department of the Treasury or the Federal Reserve, and since then they have
used paper to cover their enormous deficits, and an internal debt that has
grown five-fold in a few years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>They
use this paper to buy our goods and services. They use this paper to sustain a
deficit of up to 400 billion dollars, while we are prohibited from having any
deficit whatsoever: “Close schools, close hospitals, cast the people down into
hunger, onto the streets, into unemployment,” they say. We know all of this,
because we hear it from all of the doctors, teachers and professors who come
here to participate in meetings and recount the tragedies they face in Latin
America.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US

are the rules applied, one law for them and another law for everyone else. And
besides paying us with paper, they force us to sell them our natural resources
and industries, and in some places even the trains, parks, streets, highways,
and so on and so forth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

deficits. What does it matter to them? None of this makes any sense, none of
this has any basis in logic, none of this has any justification, except for the
justification and logic of strength, of power in all fields. We have talked
about all of this here, and if not here, at the conference where Ramonet
launched his book <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Silent Propaganda</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

people. Whenever possible, I try to avoid mixing them all together. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Ramonet’s
point of departure is an in-depth study of the influence of the U.S. media. He
had already warned us of the colossal cultural aggression of which we were
being made victims, and of the destruction of national identities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Two
years ago, the defense of national identity was the key issue at the congress
of the Union of Writers and Artists of Cuba, an issue that united our artists
and intellectuals 100%.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Ramonet
continued to develop this idea, which he has discussed in a book that, in our
opinion, is of great value. Of course, the predominant element of his theory is
that the empire’s main source of power and control is precisely its monopoly
over and use of the media. And after September 11, it was necessary to include
the concept of the guardian of security, as he calls it, or, in two words, the
military element.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Within
his theories, and even in the name he gave to one of his lectures, “Delicious
Despotism”, he was obliged to include the military element. This is what I had
begun to speak of earlier.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>What
is the reason behind these enormous expenditures on war? Is it perhaps an
attempt to inject money into the economy? From my point of view, the answer is
no. This administration is also Keynesian in its own way. They have injected a
bit of money into circulation, in the hopes of renewed growth, for a short while,
if they can manage it. Their fundamental formula is through lowering or
practically eliminating a large number of taxes. They have in fact given up on
the dream of the five trillion dollars that were supposed to be accumulated
over the course of 10 years as a result of surpluses. Now they know this will
not happen, and they have a growing deficit once again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Many
people in the United States dreamed that the surplus would be spent on ensuring
health care, improving schools, ensuring pensions for the large numbers of
retiring Americans, that is, the post-war generation. All of these dreams have
been shattered, and furthermore, the reduction and elimination of taxes is much
more beneficial for those who have more money to begin with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Does
it make any sense to inject money into a country whose people have lost the
habit of saving, where personal income savings are below zero? Yet, they want
to boost the economy by injecting money.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
increase in military spending falls far below the injection of money into
circulation through tax cuts. These are desperate measures, like the Japanese
lowering interest rates to zero to promote investment, and the United States
lowering them to 1.75%, the lowest rate I can remember; I do not know if it has
ever been lower.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So
why is this happening? Why such a huge military budget? Why such huge
investments in new technologies? It is because they are beginning to understand
that the world is becoming ever more ungovernable, that it can no longer
sustain itself merely through the enchantment of its commercials, that it needs
force, that it needs more aircraft carriers and more aircraft and more
sophisticated aircraft. It needs to declare a world war and threaten 80
countries – because they say there are now 80 countries that could be the
targets of its attacks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Some
may ask, are you not worried? We are the least worried country in the world,
because we have spent the last 43 years being threatened. We have been close to
annihilation, yes, literally annihilation, all of us, and yet the people have
not so much as wavered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
do not recall a single compatriot losing hope or panicking in 1962. I do recall
an entire nation of people full of indignation when our ally at the time,
without even consulting with Cuba, made concessions and agreements. They know
very well that these people cannot be intimidated, whether they are included on
a list or not. They cannot imagine just how little we care whether we are
included or not. Because there is another question that has to be considered first,
and that is whether or not we would exclude the United States from the list of
terrorist nations, although not all U.S. administrations have been the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thousands
of our compatriots have lost their lives as a consequence of the dirty war, of
all sorts of terrorist attacks, of Cuban passenger planes blown up in
mid-flight, of bombs set up in our hotels, of plans and more plans that I do
not want to describe in detail, although we could if it were necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Now
they have adopted a new style. Now it is not only the top-level authorities and
spokespeople, but also the ambassadors of the United States who make
declarations and give instructions. There is no longer an electoral campaign in
any of the “very independent” countries of Latin America where the U.S.
ambassador does not stick his nose in and make a speech. If it is in Nicaragua,
for example, then the grand ambassador makes a grand speech. In the past, they
were discreet proconsuls; today, they behave like consuls who have no qualms
about announcing their preferences and desires. And just look at the tone and
the style in which they do it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Even
here, where they do not even have an embassy, but just an interests section,
they have tried to adopt the same style, issuing statements critical of the
government, and on whether or not we should be excluded from the list of
terrorist nations. It is like someone who is at the bottom of a hole saying to
someone else who is up on safe ground, and who has 100 times more moral right
and reason, “Get me out of this hole and I will save your life.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is absolutely futile to use these methods on the Cuban people, because they are
a people with convictions, a people with awareness, with culture, with unity,
with moral integrity. They can never be intimidated, neither with lies nor with
threats.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
country could be wiped off the face of the Earth, but it can never be subdued,
it can never been dominated, it can never be conquered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
live by our ideals, our principles, and our ethics. That has been our life, and
that is the life of all these young people, and millions of young people like
the ones you see there on the right side of this hall. That is the life of our
people, it is the life of our children, who will be incomparably more cultured
than us, more educated than us, who will have more knowledge of the world than
us, and who have unlimited confidence in their people, unlimited confidence in
our ideas, unlimited confidence in the Revolution. That is the current
situation in our country, and that is our response. Make no mistake about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>What
is all this about threatening to use military force? And against a list of
countries that is said to include as many as 80. What happened to the idea of
an organization called the United Nations? What about that organization’s legal
standards? What happened to legal and ethical principles?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
you ask why all these seemingly absurd and inexplicable things are happening,
it is because what they are really afraid of is not actually terrorism. What
they fear more than that is the rebellion of the peoples. What they fear are
the movements that build an awareness and mobilize public opinion, which have
already waged major and memorable battles in numerous venues, and have made it
almost impossible for them to even meet together. That is why the promoters of
this policy have reacted with such fury and arrogance, resorting even to
haughty treatment of their own allies and to flirting with the idea of using
their formidable, brutal, blind and seemingly invincible power to sow panic and
terror among all the peoples of the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
consequences of this will be even greater resistance, even greater opposition,
even greater protests, even greater discontent on the part of this species
threatened not only by the worst form of slavery and colonialism ever known,
but also endangered in terms of its very survival. It is this awareness that
has mobilized many people from the middle classes of the industrialized
countries, who have gained ever greater knowledge of the dangers looming over
the environment and over their very lives and the lives of their children and
grandchildren. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Everyone
knows the facts, I do not need to repeat them here, about what is happening to
the ozone layer, about the pollution of the atmosphere, the poisoning of the
seas, the scarcity of drinking water, and so on and so forth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Californian, or some of the others here, spoke of a California without water,
or with problems involving the water table. This is not happening only in
California, it is also happening in Guanajuato. The current president of
Mexico, when he was the governor of Guanajuato and visited our country,
explained how the waters that used to be 12 meters deep are now 400 meters
deep, and there is no source to feed them. When I asked if they could inject
rainwater, he said, “It’s full of chemical products,” and the only practical
solution was highly localized irrigation to save water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
are major problems in the Middle East that threaten with future conflicts,
anyone can understand that. The human race is growing by more than 80 million
people a year. Between 1981 and 2001 –years in which International
Parliamentary Union conferences took place in Havana– in that space of just 20
years, the world’s population grew by 1.4 billion people. That was more than it
had grown from the time the human species first emerged until the beginning of
last century, which ended just a short while ago. This phenomenon is
unstoppable, and is related to erosion and a whole series of other problems
that every one knows and understands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
struggle against neoliberal globalization is a common cause shared by all the
peoples of the world, who cannot calmly accept the breaking of the Kyoto
Protocol, which means some hope; who cannot understand why nuclear shield are
being built in the world, with who knows how much money being spent on them,
when the Cold War is supposed to be over and the adversary has long ceased to
be a superpower, and its national budgets are smaller than the United States’
military budgets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Who
are they going to get to believe that the North Koreans are going to build a
missile, a nuclear weapon that can reach U.S. territory? Nobody could believe
this. Or that Iran could be a threat to the United States? Nobody believes that
either. Perhaps they were thinking of Russia, which still maintains a number of
missiles that could reach U.S. territory. They use the pretext of the other
countries they are threatening. And mixed up with all of this are the other
factors we have discussed, the tendency towards total and absolute domination
of our planet. This is, in our modest opinion, the current state of affairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If
I have not looked at my watch earlier, it is because I was afraid, and now, in
any event, it is too late to do anything about it. (Laughter) I have been
talking for three hours. But I have not kept our friend here awake (he points
to one of the delegates), he has been sleeping like a baby (laughter and
applause) and now he is wide awake and refreshed (laughter) and ready to enjoy
the delicious cocktail prepared for him by the Association of Cuban Economists.
(Laughter and applause)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>All
I will say is that the current economic and social order is unsustainable, that
many ideas have been contributed here, and that we are caught up in a battle of
ideas. I am convinced that this has been one of the meetings where the most
ideas and opinions have been put forward, coinciding with what everyone sees
and perceives more clearly every day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
will be left with the satisfaction of having witnessed the enormous wealth of
knowledge and intelligence possessed by the 500 million –or perhaps a few more–
inhabitants of our hemisphere, from the Rio Grande to Patagonia, as Martí said.
What a wealth of knowledge has been created! And this a wealth that our powerful
neighbor to the North is not interested in importing; it would rather deaden
our great minds than give them visas to enter the United States. But at least
we have a great wealth of human capital, of economists, thinkers, men and women
gifted with the knowledge so essential at this point in time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
will bid one another farewell equipped with conviction, and above all, equipped
with confidence in our future. At this moment I could say something similar to
what Salvador Allende declared before meeting his glorious death at La Moneda:
