the imperialist policy of isolation, blockade and aggression against Cuba, the
sole exception being a country that had experienced its own great social
revolution some decades before, the same that brought justice and real progress
to the people of a nation mutilated by the insatiable expansionism of its
northern neighbor and made the martyr on numerous occasions throughout its
hazardous and painful history of foreign intervention and conquest. Tragically,

imperialist domination, exploitation, injustice and pillage. Despite the deluge
of slander and lies against our exemplary people and their admirable struggle,
and in the face of countless capitulations across the globe, there are ever
more people who realize that Cuba is a powerful moral force, that defends the

American brothers have repeatedly been told stories as fantastic as those in
the “Arabian nights”, in which they believe less and less every day. For 50
years they have been told that the hundreds of thousands of children that die
every year due to neglect and hunger; the millions that work for pitiful
salaries cleaning car windshields or shoes, or being traded or sexually
exploited instead of going to school, represent democracy and respect for human
rights. That the hundreds of millions of human beings living in poverty despite
the immense wealth and natural resources that surround them; the vast number of
unemployed and underemployed people and informal laborers who survive without
the slightest aid, social security or protection; the medical neglect of
mothers, children, old people and the poor population in general; the
marginalization, drugs, lack of security and crime, are called democracy; are
called respect for human rights. That the death squads, summary executions,
torture, and the vanishing and murder of people; that the bribery, misappropriation,
diversion and bare-faced robbery of public funds while schools and hospitals
are closed, national assets and resources are privatized or often given away to
domestic and foreign friends and partners in crime and corruption, constitute
the fullest expression of democracy and human rights. It doesn’t occur to them
that the economic, political and social system that they defend is a total

seeds of fantasies, illusions and the desire for impossible consumption, a
person such as this, that indeed could include vast numbers of people in the
desperate daily fight for survival, could be the victim of every kind of abuse,
blackmail, pressure and deceit and could lack any representative organization
or see these crushed. It is certainly unlikely that such a person could be in a
position to understand the complex problems of the world and the society in
which they live. They are in no position to exercise their democratic rights,

democratic. There is only one Party, but this neither nominates nor elects
candidates. This is completely forbidden: it is the citizens from the
grassroots level who propose, nominate and elect candidates. Our country enjoys
an enviable and ever more solid and indestructible unity. The media is public
and does not and cannot belong to private individuals. It carries no commercial
advertisements and it does not promote consumerism; it entertains and informs,
educates and never alienates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
