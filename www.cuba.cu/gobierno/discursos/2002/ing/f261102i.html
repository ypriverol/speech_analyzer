lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>After a year of
tenacious efforts in preparation and training, for reasons totally beyond our
control we found ourselves compelled to cancel our athletes’ participation in a
sports event in which our country has always participated, over several
decades, right from its inception. Even in the days when the Cuban delegation
was a mere handful of athletes who, with courage and patriotism, won a few
medals as the glorious forerunners of the sporting power our nation has now
become, the product of the justice of a great revolutionary endeavor and the
incomparable heroism of our people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-US>One way or
another, they have often tried to exclude us from international competitions. Events
are repeatedly the setting for provocation and harassment, invariably defied by
our brave delegations. On one occasion, we were even ready to swim from the
ship to get to an event in Central America. This time, however, it is not worth
trying anything like that as it is a country that, with the full support of its
government, has been and continues to be a sanctuary for mercenary assassins
controlled and paid by the Miami terrorist mafia. These have until very
recently carried out terrorist attacks on our hotels, have hatched plots to
destroy historic monuments, exposing our population to the risk of bloody
massacres.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-US>It is a
country whose authorities have been the accessories to arms trafficking and the
organization of assassination attempts against Cuban delegations at major
international events, where internal law and order have gone by the board. That
country was in no position to offer any guarantee for the physical or moral
safety of our athletes. The last straw was that they did not even accept our
request for talks with that country’s authorities to discuss the safety of our
delegation --nearly a thousand Cubans-- in a country where there is not even a
Cuban diplomatic representation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Apparently, the
terrorists and their allies thought that Cuba would not pass up the medals and
records its delegation would have won at this event; that we would choose to
place our athletes, trainers and officials at risk, leaving them at the mercy
of cowardly and unscrupulous criminals. They thought that we could forget and
ignore that it is the very same city where one of the two main perpetrators of
the blasting in mid air of the plane carrying the Cuban junior fencing team
with all the gold medals obtained at a similar event --all perished without trace--
operated with impunity, as do his allies and accomplices today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The terrorist
mafia and its collaborators should have known that out of honor and principle,
Cuba has been ready more than once in the past to sacrifice laurels and
interests. Our only regret is not being able to provide the support we planned
for El Salvador sports movement and its officials, and to those brotherly
people, many of whose heroic sons have always shown solidarity and friendship
toward Cuba. We take comfort in our conviction that the circumstances
preventing our cooperation in many fields where it could be useful will not
last forever. If anyone doubts the sincerity of Cuba's regard for the
Salvadoran people, suffice it to remember that, despite the above mentioned
events, dozens of Cuban doctors instantly responded to the appeal to care for
the noble Salvadoran people, and to deliver material and technical resources,
when the country was hit by a major dengue epidemic that took the lives of over
30 children between September and December 2000, and after a devastating
earthquake in January 2001 that ravaged that brotherly nation making such
assistance necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We shall always
be true to those principles of solidarity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>But what were
we to do with the nearly 500 athletes who have made sacrifices and trained for
so long for this event? This justified concern produced an idea that will
certainly prove fruitful. Why not hold a national Olympics? Have we not in our
country enough first-class athletes to make up three teams, any of which could
end first in El Salvador in many sport disciplines, if not at the top of the
medal count? We hold national schools sporting championships every year, so why
had we never thought of organizing a national Olympics, with regional
participation by our best athletes in the various sports disciplines? Such an
event whose cost in hard currency would be less than 30% of the cost of sending
a Cuban delegation to the Central American Games, could be held every two years
as a perfect way of training for the Olympic cycle and accelerating the
development of sport in our country. This would not interfere with their
training for international events; on the contrary, it would make it better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>An activity of
this kind would promote efforts to improve and extend our sporting facilities
and the application of advanced technology in the various disciplines of this
vital activity, as it has been the case with the National Baseball Series since
(the baseball match in) Baltimore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The idea of
staging an alternative event that would reward the efforts made by our athletes
to train for the Central American Games by holding this National Olympics will
allow for the participation of over 1,500 superb athletes out of the 2,000
involved in the process of training and selection of the Cuban delegation, that
is, three times as many athletes as would have gone to El Salvador.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The medals they
win will be included in the athletes’ personal records and will be among the
most precious prizes and awards they obtain in their lifetime. Morally, they
will be the true champions of the event that terrorism and crime prevented them
from attending.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>As it is known,
Cuba has set up an International School of Physical Education and Sport --and
it is perhaps the first country in the world to have done so-- where over 1,000
young people, all of them with various sporting skills, from 68 Third World
countries are taking higher-level courses. The School has been invited to
participate with outstanding individual athletes and teams in our First National
Olympics. The same invitation has been extended to outstanding athletes or
teams selected among the 6,073 youths from 24 countries attending the Latin
American School of Medical Sciences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of other national sporting events, athletes from countries outside the area
covered by the Central American and Caribbean Games have been invited to take

movement will rigorously observe all the principles and rules of the
International Olympic Movement, whose new chairman, Mr. Jacques Rogge, did us
the great honor of visiting our country a few days ago, leaving us with a
feeling of sympathy and respect. The anti-doping war he is promoting will help
curb commercial sport and professionalism in the Olympic Movement, where drug
abuse is common and laboratory tests are never done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dignity, enthusiasm and satisfaction our people will enjoy this new and unique
sporting event. Broadcasting will amount to 687.5 hours by radio and over 180
hours of television, albeit carefully arranged --given the continuing
limitations on TV air time-- so as not to interfere with the educational
programming now being presented so successfully in our country, for the
comprehensive cultural advancement for our people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
