<p ALIGN="CENTER">JOINT DECLARATION</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the official visit of President Hugo Chávez Frías to Cuba on
the tenth anniversary of his first meeting with the Cuban people, a far-reaching exchange
of ideas between the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the President of
the Council of State of the Republic of Cuba and their respective delegations took place.
The two heads of state agreed to sign a document containing the following points:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We wish to draw attention to the fact that the Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA) is the most blatant expression yet of a hunger to dominate the region and,
were it to come into effect, it would mark an intensification of neo liberalism and create
unprecedented levels of dependence and subordination. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have made an historical analysis of the integration process in Latin
America and the Caribbean and we find that, far from responding to aspirations of
independent development and regional economic complementarity, it has acted as a mechanism
to increase dependence and foreign domination.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also find that the profits obtained over the last five decades by
the big transnational companies, the weakening of the import substitution model, the
foreign debt crisis and, more recently, the spread of neo-liberal policies coupled with a
greater transnationalisation of Latin American and Caribbean economies and with the
proliferation of negotiations to reach free trade agreements like the FTAA have set the
foundations which give rise to the scenario of subordination and backwardness plaguing our
region today.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THEREFORE: <br>
We resolutely reject the FTAA&#146;s content and proposals and we share the conviction
that the so-called integration on neo-liberal bases the FTAA represents would consolidate
the scenario described earlier and would only lead to a greater disunity between Latin
American countries, to more poverty and despair for the largest sectors of people in our
countries, to the denationalization of the region&#146;s economies and to total
subordination to foreign dictates.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We wish to make clear that, if indeed integration is, for the countries
of Latin America and the Caribbean, an absolute necessity if they hope to develop in the
midst of the accelerating formation of large regional blocs which occupy commanding
positions in the world economy, only integration based on co-operation, solidarity and a
common willingness to advance hand in hand towards higher levels of development can
satisfy the needs and desires of Latin American and Caribbean countries while preserving
their independence, sovereignty and identity.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We agree that the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (BAA),
proposed by President Hugo Chávez Frías at the Association of Caribbean States&#146; 3<sup>rd</sup>
Summit of Heads of State and Government held on Margarita Island in December 2001,
outlines the guiding principles for true Latin American and Caribbean integration based on
justice; we commit ourselves to work together to make this a reality.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We reaffirm that the cardinal principle by which the BAA must be guided
is the most extensive possible solidarity between the peoples of Latin America and the
Caribbean; that it must rest on the thought of Bolívar, Martí, Sucre, O&#146;Higgins,
San Martín, Hidalgo, Petion, Morazán, Sandino and many other founding fathers; that
there must be no selfish nationalism nor restrictive domestic policies which obstruct the
aim of building a Great Homeland in Latin America, the Homeland dreamt of by the heroes of
our emancipation struggles.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this token, we are in complete agreement that the BAA cannot come
into being based on mercantilist criteria or selfish concerns for company profits or for
any national benefit to the detriment of other peoples. Only a broad Latin Americanist
vision which acknowledges the impossibility of our countries developing and being truly
free in isolation from one another, will lead towards the achievement of what Bolívar
called &quot;&#133;seeing the greatest nation in the world come into being in America,
greatest not so much because of its size and wealth but because of its liberty and
glory&quot;, a nation which Martí conceived of as &quot;Our America&quot; to
differentiate it from the other America, the expansionist one with the imperialist
cravings.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also affirm that the aim of the BAA is to transform Latin American
societies by making them more fair, better educated, more participative and with more
solidarity and that, in order for this to happen, the BAA is conceived of as an
all-embracing process which will assure the elimination of social inequalities and promote
quality of life and the peoples&#146; effective participation in forging their own
destiny.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We share the opinion that, in order to achieve the aims mentioned
above, the BAA must be guided by the following cardinal principles and bases.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Trade and investment must not be ends in themselves but tools to achieve fair and
    sustainable development, since true Latin American and Caribbean integration cannot
    blindly follow the market nor can it simply be a strategy to expand foreign markets or
    boost trade. To achieve our aims, the state must efficiently play the role of regulator
    and coordinator of economic activity.</li>
  <li>Special and differentiated treatment which takes the level of development of the
    different countries and the size of their economies into account and which guarantees that
    all nations taking part have access to the benefits deriving from the process of
    integration.</li>
  <li>Economic complementarity and cooperation among countries involved as opposed to
    competition between countries and products in order that efficient and competitive product
    specialization is encouraged, one that is compatible with balanced economic development in
    each country, compatible with the strategies for the battle against poverty and with the
    preservation of the peoples&#146; cultural identity.</li>
  <li>Cooperation and solidarity which find their expression in special plans for the Least
    Developed Countries in the region and which shall include a Continental Plan to Fight
    Illiteracy using the modern techniques which have already been tested in Venezuela; a
    Latin American plan for free healthcare services for people who do not have access to
    these services and a regional scholarship plan in areas most useful for economic and
    social development.</li>
  <li>The creation of a Social Emergency Fund as proposed by President Hugo Chávez at the
    South American Countries Summit held recently in Ayacucho.</li>
  <li>Development of communications and transport between Latin American and Caribbean
    countries that foster integration and which include joint plans for roads, railways, air
    and sea transportation lines, telecommunication etc.</li>
  <li>Actions to foster sustainable development through standards which protect the
    environment encourage the rational use of resources and prevent the proliferation of
    patterns of consumption which are wasteful and foreign to the reality facing our peoples.</li>
  <li>An integration of energy industries between the countries of the region which will
    ensure a stable supply of energy products to the benefit of Latin American and Caribbean
    societies. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is advancing this idea by setting up
    Petroamerica.</li>
  <li>Encouraging investment of Latin American capital in Latin America and the Caribbean with
    the aim to reduce the dependence of the region&#146;s nations on foreign investors. Steps
    to achieve this would include creating a Latin American Investment Fund, a Southern
    Development Bank and the Society for Reciprocal Latin American Guarantees.</li>
  <li>The defence of Latin American and Caribbean culture and of the identity of the peoples
    in the region, showing particular respect for and promotion of autochthonous and
    indigenous cultures. The creation of The Southern Television Broadcasting Company
    (TELESUR) as an alternative instrument to broadcast coverage of what really happens in our
    countries</li>
  <li>Measures to ensure that intellectual property regulations do not become deterrence on
    much needed cooperation in all areas between our countries as they work to protect the
    heritage of Latin American and Caribbean countries from the voracity of transnational
    corporations.</li>
  <li>Harmonising positions in the multilateral arena and for negotiations of all kinds with
    countries and blocs from other regions, including the struggle for democratization and
    transparency in international institutions, particularly in the United Nations and its
    agencies.</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the year in which we celebrate the 180th anniversary of the glorious
victory of Ayacucho and of the call to Panama Anphyctionic Congress which tried to open
the way to a process of authentic integration for our countries, frustrated from that time
on, we state our conviction that now, finally, with the consolidation of the Bolivarian
revolution and the undeniable failure of the neoliberal policies imposed on our peoples,
the Latin American and Caribbean peoples are on the path to their second true
independence. The emergence of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas proposed by
President Hugo Chávez is the best expression of this.</p>

thousand and four.</p>
