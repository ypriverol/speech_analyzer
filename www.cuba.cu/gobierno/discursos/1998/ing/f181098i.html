<p ALIGN="CENTER"></font><font face="Arial" size="3">Fidel Castro, <strong>SPEECH IN THE
CLOSING SESSION OF THE 8TH SUMMIT OF HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT OF IBERO-AMERICAN
COUNTRIES, Oporto, Portugal. 18 October, 1998</strong></font><font SIZE="7"></p>
</font></b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This speech was transcribed by the
Shorthand Version Department of the Council of State</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Your Majesty [King Juan Carlos of Spain],</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Your Excellencies,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Esteemed members of delegations present
here,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Distinguished guests,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I will try to be as concise as possible,
speaking, if need be, telegram like. First of all, I would like to say in all frankness,
as I always do, that in my opinion this has been an extremely fruitful meeting. I would go
so far as to say that never before had so much been done, in such a short time, for our
aspirations of integration, unity and development.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The method devised by the Portuguese was
excellent: No speeches - they informed me and every other - a maximum spontaneity,
dialogue and exchange of impressions. As for me, I did not write anything. I was to say
some final words. I did not have time to write anything for that either and it was better
because, it would have been impossible to write yesterday about the impressions of today.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The opening session began with the
heartfelt words expressed by President [Rafael] Caldera [of Venezuela]. Thoughtful
contributions by the Prime Minister of Portugal, [Antonio] Guterres, and President [Jorge]
Sampaio enlightened our spirits. We all realized that sensitive subjects were being
touched on. We were then moved to another room. I do not know why the ladies were left
out, but the delegations took part. One good thing: we felt free to speak in greater
privacy. The press was not there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The experience of many meetings has taught
us that there are different shades and nuances. There are practically two speeches: when
we are speaking for the world, for our country and other countries and when we are
speaking among ourselves. However, we will not hide anything from the press.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The statements began. The first speaker,
and I am not going to give a complete account of them, was President [Fernando Henrique]
Cardoso [of Brazil]. I thought it was an excellent idea that he should speak first because
the world's attention is, you might say, on Brazil as a potential gateway to South and
Latin America for the serious crisis threatening us; that is the country where a special
effort is needed, because what happens there will be crucial. Really, we were all pleased.
Personally, I was especially pleased by his in-depth analysis.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">He told us about the three runs suffered by
the Brazilian economy in 1995, 1997 and 1998, which took tens of billions of dollars from
the reserves the country had accumulated with so much effort. He stated his views,
essentially, the pressing need to inject new and sufficient liquidity into international
finances.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">He added some very interesting things when
he practically raised the need for two policies: one related to the emerging countries
which are highly vulnerable to the risks of the financial crisis and, another one, for the
industrialized countries with the necessary resources. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If I were to summarize it, I would dare
say, in a broad outline, that he expounded the idea of an austere, very cautious economic
policy for developing countries, that is, for the domestic economy of our countries and a
Keynesian policy for international finances. I do not think this is very different from
some statements recently made by personalities whose decisions are as important for the
world economy, as the president&#146;s of the United States and the directors&#146; of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, who did so in the face of the serious
unfolding crisis.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I cannot mention all those who spoke
afterward. Many of them made valuable and important contributions. However, I will mention
some who, in my opinion, summarized very important ideas. The contribution by [Chilean]
President [Eduardo] Frei, related to the message that the meeting had to elaborate in
addition to the Declaration to send it to those with the most decision-making power in
international finance. What should be the nature of the message? It did not seem right to
send a message that would give the impression of a catastrophic, insoluble or pessimistic
situation but, rather, to state openly, realistically and avoiding any overstatement,
which is far from required, the current financial situation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">President [Ernesto] Zedillo [of Mexico]
called our attention to the fact that, although priority should be given to midterm and
future solutions as well as those related to a new architecture, the fire had to be put
out immediately. Another idea, among several others, referred to the need for Europe to
react and provide its full support to measures considered essential to try to halt the
crisis and resume economic growth.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The contribution by President [Jose María]
Aznar, head of the Spanish Government, is worth mentioning. Two very encouraging things:
Spain's decision to contribute five billion dollars to the International Monetary Fund.
That is practicing the preaching. Europe was being asked to react in accordance with the
first steps taken in the United States on the reduction of interest rates considered, at
this point, a key element to start building confidence and injecting liquidity to
international finances. And something very important for Latin Americans; that three out
of these five billion dollars would be allocated to an emergency fund for Latin America.
That is what we need: emergency funds to cope with the situation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">He also addressed Spain's policy of
continuing to carry as many Spanish investments as possible to Latin America. It is very
important that such decisions were made in this meeting.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In the latest meeting, Argentina reported a
one billion contribution. In other words, six billion came out of this summit, when
developed countries are being asked to make the maximum contribution in their own interest
and that of the Third World.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Before that, another important event,
another Spanish contribution worthy of recognition: a 0.5 percent interest rate reduction,
that is, double the first reduction made by the United States Federal Reserve System.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">These are, in my opinion, excellent
decisions when trying to win support, to remove doubts and obstacles in order to receive
similar support from the rest of the European Economic Community countries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The content of the message which had been
agreed upon in the morning session, in addition to the Declaration, and how it should be
drafted was discussed and full consensus reached. We were all convinced that the correct
way to proceed was as originally proposed on the draft message later discussed in the
afternoon session.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">To make things clearer, I should perhaps
say that it had been decided to continue the dialogue over lunch. The Portuguese managed
to get some wireless microphones and to work another incredible miracle: the continuation
of the dialogue over lunch but, this time, just the heads of state or government.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It was there - and I should make this clear
- that the content of the message was discussed. Only the heads of state were present. It
was a most excellent meeting - one of the best that I have seen - in which the meal did
not get in the way of anything. Some ate more, others less. Since I was interested in
asking many questions of my more experienced colleagues who were tackling the issue, I did
not even touch my lunch. Besides, there was the tension of the afternoon session and this
speech.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There, all by ourselves, with no other
company but the problems we all have and those we all carry together on our shoulders, the
content of the message was clearly defined. There was a consensus but, at the same time,
there was a concept on which opinions differed: whether it was possible, at this point in
time, to speak of a world economic crisis or of a global economic crisis.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It was pointed out that the United States
economy was in good health, which is very true; that the United States economy is still -
it is I who say &quot;still&quot; - in good health, and we want it to continue in good
health. Also, that the European economy is in good health and it is expected to continue
like that, supported by growing integration and particularly the implementation of the
euro. More success than hazards are presently being forecast for the euro, although
certain analysis in the press might suggest the authors&#146; hopes that the euro will
fail. Could we speak of a global crisis or not?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We, Cubans, had a serious dilemma
concerning the theme for the Havana summit.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We had already worked on the idea of a
theme associated precisely with the problem of the crisis, based on the fact that the
crisis is developing, that there is an infinite number of unknown factors and that we
would have to examine what had happened, what was happening and all the measures adopted.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are living in a situation where events
are rapidly following one another, and oftentimes they come as a surprise. Nobody knows
what is going to happen between now and January 1999, when we will have in our country a
meeting of economists from various schools of thought and from different countries to
discuss these issues in theoretical terms. It is possible that, by that date, by 21st
January, some of those who were thinking differently might have changed their minds,
because we have seen very important personalities change their minds in a very short
period of two weeks. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">For us, it was critical to define what we
would do with the theme we had prepared. A short tittle was called for, one which covers a
lot of things but needs to be explained.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We started out from certain facts, and I am
not going to take up much of your time with this. On page 23 of that collection of
speeches, headed by the United Nations report, Kofi Annan&#146;s report in September, is
President Clinton's speech of 14th September 1998, given at the U.S. Council on Foreign
Relations; a key speech. The first thing that Clinton says to begin his speech is the
following phrase: &quot;This is the greatest financial challenge faced by the world in a
half-century.&quot; Quite a strong statement.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Further on, he adds: &quot;It is a great
irony that we are at a moment of unsurpassed economic strength at a time of such turmoil
in the world economy.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">He later says that, for 30 years, the
United States and the rest of the world have been concerned about inflation. Then he adds:
&quot;But clearly the balance of risks has now shifted, with a quarter of the world's
population living in countries with declining economic growth or negative economic growth.
Therefore, I believe the world's chief priority today plainly is to spur economic
growth.&quot; This phrase suits us very well, because this is what we are requesting,
demanding of the industrialized world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As we analyzed the content of the message
to Europe that could not have a pessimistic word but rather be a realistic discourse, we
recalled that at the end of his well-crafted and careful speech President Clinton
concluded with unusual and humble candor: &quot;In this room I think it is not too simple
to say we know what to do.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That speech was delivered in the Council on
Foreign Relations, a prestigious and very well-known American institution in the field of
foreign policy. So, it was Clinton who said that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">On 6 October 1996, I know it by heart
because I found all this very interesting, the chairman of the International Monetary Fund
who, as you all know, is not characterized by his pessimism, quite the contrary, reacting
to criticism that there was not enough transparency on events in South-East Asia and the
recklessness in which loans had been made without the relevant analyses, partiality and
all the rest - which I do not need to repeat because you have all read many times in the
last few months those things about which not a single word had been said, when the word
&quot;transparency&quot; born in the days of perestroika reappeared, transparency in
information and in data, transparency in banking, which everybody was demanding - he
defended himself by stating that they did know what was going to happen, that they had
warned certain governments, but that they did not make it public because it would have
wreaked havoc and accelerated the crisis.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today, nobody knows what might have been
best; if a bit of transparency and a warning that would have curbed the seriousness of
that sudden explosion, of that unexpected crisis that came as such a surprise to the
world. That is to say, he is not a man who can be characterized as a pessimist but he said
it there openly: &quot;Governors, you have come this year in the midst of a crisis. A
crisis that has already cost hundreds of billions of dollars.&quot; To be more exact he
could have used a known data: the stock markets worldwide had already lost between three
and four trillion dollars. Michel Camdessus said that a few days ago on 6th October, at a
meeting of the International Monetary Fund Board of Governors and the World Bank group. He
immediately added that it had also cost &quot;millions of jobs&quot;. He did not say tens
of millions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If you read the reports on the situation in
Indonesia, there alone unemployment has reached 40 percent. He concluded the paragraph
with the following words: &quot;And the non countable tragedy of lost opportunities and
lost hope for so many people, particularly among the poorest.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">He said a lot more, two or three other
things: &quot;But even the well-managed economies have not been spared. We did not
anticipate the strength of this virus&quot;, he almost compared it to AIDS, &quot;which
has struck far and wide, for instance attacking Latin America because Russia ran into
trouble.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Now, in the aftermath of this second
shock of the crisis, most developing countries face a sharply weaker environment, greatly
diminished capital flows, and declining commodity prices.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This phenomenon is first mentioned very
closely associated in history with what events occurred in 1929 and in the preceding
months: an irrepressible increase in stock values and a drop in commodity prices.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Finally, Camdessus said - I think it was
the last thing he said on the seriousness of the crisis - &quot;Let us be clear: we are
speaking not just of countries in crisis, but of a system in crisis, a system not yet
sufficiently adapted to the opportunities and risks of globalization.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">My attention was especially drawn by the
words of the International Monetary Fund chairman on the question of whether or not it was
possible to speak of a global economic crisis or an international economic crisis. There
are obvious elements that might produce a certain confusion.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today, in the second meeting, President
Cardoso said - I took note of it - &quot;We are living at an extremely grave time.&quot;
And this is said by the president of Brazil, whose experience and knowledge we are all
aware of.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">These elements were being discussed and,
for us, they were crucial, I mean, with regard to the subject for the Havana summit.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I asked my colleagues to help us. I do not
call them comrades because I do not want to sound such a left-wing extremist as Mr.
Wolfenshon, director of the World Bank; I wish I could come across some left-wing agendas
with the text of his closing speech at the Washington meeting on 8 October 1998. Usually,
the prospective host country proposed and decided the subject but I wanted to consult all
the others. I had come to the conclusion that we had to be prudent rather than overdo it.
Saying that there is not a crisis and that there is not a very serious or extremely grave
situation, as Cardoso put it, would mean ignoring the harsh reality. Stating that there is
already a global economic crisis might sound like an exaggeration and that could in fact
be the case.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When drafting a paragraph on the theme, we
tried to state, in essence, one idea: What had Ibero-America done? Or rather, how has
Ibero-America faced the global crisis? This assuming that, by the time, it had done quite
a lot, without waiting a whole year, because nobody can wait for even a single minute. But
it was long and so we changed it for another phrase: Ibero-America and the global economic
crisis. After the fruitful discussions held at noon, we were absolutely persuaded that it
was necessary to modify the original phrase to be more realistic, more objective and more
precise: Ibero-America and the serious risks of a global economic crisis. This wording
seemed more accurate and, fortunately, it met with total acceptance, the full consensus of
everyone present at that lunch. Thus it became the theme of the next summit.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I tell you that I am getting to the end of
my speech; I am getting there (<i>Laughter</i>). Now then, how do we see the strategic
situation? Like this: as we see it, Latin America is bound to play a decisive role. This
is where it will be decided whether the economic crisis is curbed and reversed and its
globalization prevented. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am deeply convinced that if this crisis
invaded Brazil, it would have an impact throughout South America, it would inevitably have
Mexico relapse into it and have an absolutely irreversible effect on the United States
stock market. If a crisis in Russia, with a 2 percent share of the world economy - which I
consider an overstatement because its gross domestic product is now 450 billion [dollars],
half that of Brazil and below that of France, Spain and many other countries - made the
strongest index on the New York Stock Exchange drop 512 points in one day, what would
happen if there was a crisis in Brazil, extended to South America?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">To be honest, it should be said that Brazil
struggled alone against that risk. There were lots of analyses in prestigious magazines
that pointed to Brazil as the next and inevitable victim of the crisis, following Russia,
on the basis of data revealing a budget deficit of over 7 percent of the gross domestic
product; an assumed overrating of the <i><b>real</b></i> and an already increasing high
current-account deficit. These are the circumstances in which speculators pounce, like
hungry wolves, on the economy of any country, this time, Brazil.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Hence the conviction that the United States
stock markets would not be able to hold out against this. It could become a catastrophe
much worse than that of 1929, when only 5 percent of Americans had their savings and
resources invested in the stock market. Today, 50 percent of Americans and almost all the
pension funds and savings of the American middle class and the highest-income workers are
invested in the stock market. Really, in my opinion, it would have unimaginable
consequences.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This clearly indicates that the United
States and the industrialized world are interested in preventing, at all costs, that
crisis in Brazil and South America. Of course, Brazil is very interested, more than anyone
else, and so is the rest of Latin America.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Who helped Brazil, if only with a word of
encouragement, in the four years it sustained the three runs on its currency? Nobody!
Brazil defended itself, among other things, with the reserves it had accumulated. It
managed to increase the reserve to 70 billion [dollars], which is really high; then, only
in August and September, after the Russian crisis, it lost over 20 billion dollars. Then,
for the first time, some encouraging words and promises of support for Brazil were heard.
It is now clear that Brazil is vitally important for the United States and for the rest of
the industrialised world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I think, first, that this does not mean
that, aware of such a reality, Brazil and South America should sit idly by waiting for
those in great danger to give resources to Brazil. On the other hand, there is no need to
tell Brazil to make these efforts because it has been doing so for four years, defending
the stability of its currency, sacrificing its reserves.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Let me tell you that, with the reserves
they had to spend in August and September alone, we could have a two-digit growth in Cuba.
And it is not such a large amount when compared with what it cost South Korea - a 100
billion dollars - or Thailand and other countries. In only two months, Brazil had to use
more than 20 billion dollars from its reserves.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have also read President Cardoso's
speeches, before and after the election, which has let me gauge his political talent too.
I am not going to add any more virtues, because I rather avoid misunderstandings with the
left (<i>Laughter</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">However, we should recognize, in all
fairness, the confidence, firmness and ability demonstrated by the president in that
lonely battle. Now, he is not alone anymore. Now, he has lots of company, and good
company. This is a good political moment for him to lead his country, with recognized
international prestige and excellent relations with many of the main leaders of the
financial institutions, who appreciate his knowledge; good relations with the United
States leadership; good relations with Europe; and his record in the battle waged. This
points to the enormous fright and concern, but above all, the United States and
Europe&#146;s awareness of Brazil&#146;s decisive importance as the last defense in
preventing the crisis complete expansion.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Cardoso gave two speeches. One before the
election, on 24 September 1998, in which he really made a bold decision - I should say
bold and intelligent; boldness is not enough - when he stated the measures he would be
taken. To avoid interference with internal affairs, I will not say anything about them. I
am simply pointing out political strategies and tactics. But, tough measures are tough
measures and stating them before elections is not common practice in the political
traditions of our hemisphere.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">My relations with the left are not bad,
despite the fact that it is sometimes difficult to maintain relations with left-wing
forces. Family problems easily arise for a simple difference of opinion and they can get
to the point of harmful words thoughtlessly said. They demand of us more than they do of
the vestal virgins of Rome. Anyone can make a slight mistake, we cannot make any. Great
care is needed because, before we get up in the morning and even without them knowing for
sure if what has been said is true or not, they are already passing judgment on us.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In strategic terms, Latin America is now in
an excellent position. We are something today. They have to count on us.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Actually, in risky situations, as we are
going through along with the rest of the world, I am convinced it is necessary to work not
only for unity among all the Latin American and Caribbean countries but also for the
greatest possible unity within countries. I do not even dare to recommend it, I am simply
saying what I think. These are political matters closely linked to a great battle for
survival which requires the utmost understanding, unity and even subordination of the
national interests to the interests of our peoples as a whole; these are not incompatible,
they rather supplement and guarantee each other.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">These are the reasons why I am arguing or
trying to explain this concept on the strategic situation. And, I repeat, the United
States and Europe cannot afford to let the crisis strike Brazil or South America or the
rest of Latin America. It would be a catastrophe for everyone.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have already said that this has been one
of the most fruitful meetings that I have seen. I also try to be realistic, not to
entertain illusions. And, I repeat, never before was so much progress made in unifying
ideas and marching along the road to integration at this difficult time. What is more, we
have happily welcome the peace message received in this already historical - I dare to
call it historical - meeting in Oporto on something as complicated and difficult: a solid
and well-founded hope of peace between Peru and Ecuador.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The extraordinary and strategically
important task of uniting and integrating South America is still ahead.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I sincerely concede to you that it is
difficult to accept the idea of integration limited only to MERCOSUR. I am saying here
what I sincerely think and believe. To many European visitors and many friends and
political leaders who visit Cuba, often quietly, I always raise the principle that it is
necessary to help Latin America unite. I never tire of preaching that idea. To be
stronger, we should join our strengths.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have talked here about globalization and
regionalization, but I am convinced our need for unity comes first, just like the
Europeans are uniting. I must also declare that under no circumstances can the Caribbean
countries be neglected, nor should they. They are a force. They have significant political
influence in the United Nations. They are very talented leaders, forged in a parliamentary
tradition and debate from the grassroots, a system that has worked for them. They are
highly respected in Africa and other parts of the world. We need their support and their
strength.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Central Americans cannot be forgotten
either. I must say that frankly.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am aware of the concerns held by Central
American and Caribbean leaders. Some of them are not very friendly toward Cuba but we
rather ignore it, we always do. That does not matter; what matters are the tasks to which
we have committed ourselves and in which we are involved. I defend, and I will continue to
defend in the future, the situation of the Central American and Caribbean peoples, who
feel God has abandoned them, because they have seen MERCOSUR and NAFTA making progress
while 150 companies- which resulted from that Caribbean Basin Initiative- have moved to
Mexico. The Mexicans are not to blame; it is the market laws. A hundred thousand jobs have
been lost in the Caribbean, a region I visited recently.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They cannot be disregarded. They will be in
Rio, with us, together with Europe, in such a strategic and decisive meeting as will take
place between the European Community, Latin America and the Caribbean, fully aware of the
importance of European integration and relations with Europe for our region. I am not just
saying it here. I raised it at the WTO when I said: If the euro is going to be a strong,
solid currency; if it is going to support the economies of Third World countries, we
welcome the euro. I heard a widespread murmur at that conference room in Geneva. We are
aware of the importance of the euro and of European integration.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When we speak of peace between Ecuador and
Peru, it is because we dream of a day when there is greater political integration. We all
dream of that. We all need that. If unity has been achieved in Europe, where there are
such different cultures and where nations were at war with one another for centuries, why
can we not unite, being so closely bound by language, culture, religion and history!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have 50 unifying elements that Europe
does not have and we have been independent for almost 200 years. Conflicts between
countries jeopardize our unity. That is why we do not only think about those conflicts but
we want relations to improve between Chile, Bolivia and Peru; we want relations to improve
between Nicaragua and Costa Rica and for there be no conflicts due to such unimportant
issues as navigation on a bordering river; new disputes should not be allowed to arise,
they must be timely prevented.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The agreement to include the paragraph
related to peace in Colombia was also extremely important; another achievement of this
meeting.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This is what I had to say.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We will meet again in Havana. Just like
during Pope John Paul II's visit, Cuba will be yours.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I apologize for the imposition on your time
and I thank you (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>
