<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>SPEECH BY COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF FIDEL
CASTRO AT THE CLOSING OF THE SECOND SPECIAL EDUCATION WORLD MEETING. Karl Marx Theater,
Havana. <i>20 June 1998</i></strong></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I see that most of you are women (<i>Laughter
and applause</i>.); therefore, I must begin by saying:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Dear women delegates;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Dear men delegates (<i>Laughter.</i>) We're
not going to forget you now;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Dear Cuban teachers invited to this
activity (<i>Applause.</i>):</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I know I have come a little late, because
the Brazilians have already left us. You wanted me to say a few words the first day and I
made you a signal. It wasn't meant as a farewell, but rather to let you know that I meant
to return. But, besides, I'm the least indicated person to deliver these final remarks,
because I haven't participated in the meetings, nor in the scientific conferences, nor in
the debates that you have held.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I've been able to follow what has come out
in the press, on T.V., some news items that I've received, but very brief ones. I did have
the opportunity to listen to the opening remarks of our Minister [of Education] and of the
President of the Association who has just honored me with the undeserved plaque which has
been awarded me (<i>Exclamations and prolonged applause.</i>) and which I have received
only in the name of those who really deserve it: our teachers. (<i>Applause.</i>) Those of
today... (<i>From the audience: &quot;And those of yesterday&quot;.</i>) How did you
guess? Do you have some sort of device to know in advance what one is going to say? (<i>Laughter.</i>)
Well, if I'm at a loss for words, I'll borrow them from you. That's what I meant to say:
Those of today and those of yesterday. We cannot forget them, all the pedagogues and
scientists who have worked in our country&#151;scientific pedagogues, researchers&#151;for
the achievements that have been mentioned here, to be able to exchange the experiences
that have been exchanged here, to be able to hold meetings as the one that has just been
held. And, according to what I hear, it seems we will have another one in the year 2000.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">To speak about education in our country
would be very lengthy. Just remember that we practically started off from scratch, just
remember that 30% of our population was illiterate and 60% semi-illiterate. Nobody knows
who actually knew how to read and write in this country. Because having passed the first,
the second, the third grade, knowing how to sign and how to write a few phrases or even a
letter, does not mean that a person is literate, or that that person has received some
learning, or can be considered a learned person.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I asked our minister, Gómez (<i>He refers
to the Minister of Education, Luis Ignacio Gómez.)</i>, if he happened to remember how
many teachers there were in Cuba when the Revolution triumphed, and he told me that around
29,000. He then added that approximately 10,000-and that figure I do remember-were
unemployed. They had no classrooms nor budgetary funds for education.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There were some schools, known as <i>escuelas
normales</i> [teachers' training schools], which we have a lot to thank for, because they
trained those teachers, but since there are always people of all sorts, as the education
of those teachers did not instill in them the sense of duty to teach in any part of the
country, this aspect was not included in our country's pedagogic training. So, even though
after the triumph of the Revolution we allocated some of the few resources we had to send
teachers to the mountains and to the countryside, not enough teachers were willing to go
and teach there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, there were always some who did,
but our teachers had not been educated to carry out such a task. However, those who were
willing to work in the city and in the countryside were the seed from which grew this
relatively big tree, which constitutes our educational system, and also the achievements
attained during these years. We must remember them too as the seed which sprouted what we
have today.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This was not a subject that could be
learned overnight, neither could we presume what had to be done. We did realize that first
of all we had to teach the people to read and write, and that task was fulfilled with the
help of the teachers&#151;those few teachers that we had&#151;and the people's
participation, mainly that of students, junior and senior high school students, university
students, and volunteers in general with an educational level sufficiently high to teach
to read and write in one year people who had practically never gone to school.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Those who were going to teach the
illiterate received courses on the methods to use and then set off for all parts of the
country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The blockade was already there, as were the
mercenary bands organized in many parts of the country, organized by the United States,
armed bands which unfortunately murdered some of those teachers, whose names are
remembered today in the names of schools and other institutions. They are remembered and
shall always be remembered, even some of the students, almost adolescents, who went to the
mountains or the plains to teach people to read and write. More than 100,000 people
participated. It was a large number, I say 100,000, that is a minimum figure, but if we
add them all up... someone here must know the exact figure. I reckon that at least 150,000
participated in that campaign.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our country achieved the feat&#151;which I
believe no other country has ever achieved&#151;of teaching to read and write that huge
number of illiterates that we had, of teaching that first grade, we could say, to all of
those who did not know how to read and write and were still physically able to learn
something&#151;and I know they taught people who were even older than 80. Of course, many
of those who were taught to read and write, especially the younger ones, later became
teachers, professors and university graduates, many of them. Some of them graduated from
the university, because even more important than the literacy campaign were the plans to
carry it on, the follow-up programs, as we called them then.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thus, after that year, for a very long
time, a great effort ensued to make these people reach the second, the third, the sixth
grade, junior high school, and there were many who reached the latter level, in spite of
the lack of teachers we had.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We had to turn many high school graduates
and people with the necessary school level into teachers while we were training the new
ones. We even had so few junior high school students, that the first students we recruited
en masse to be teachers had only finished the sixth grade. There weren't enough junior
high school graduates to send, after nine grades of study, to learn the noble profession
of teaching.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But, besides, many of the high school
students and graduates were needed not only for education, but for many other sectors as
well. The country's defense called upon many young people with certain qualification to
learn to use specific weapons with which we had to defend ourselves from that powerful
neighbor, a neighbor, who in the middle of the literacy campaign, in 1961, invaded us with
mercenary troops. Because the infamous Bay of Pigs invasion took place in April of 1961,
the Year of the Literacy Campaign, and not even the mercenary invasion&#151;which, by the
way, was finished in less than 72 hours, no matter how well advised, trained and supported
it was from abroad, and right in front of the U.S. squadron, apparently ready to
disembark, although they didn't even have time since we didn't let them establish a
government there&#151;not even under those circumstances was the literacy campaign
stopped. I think that was one of the greatest merits of that year, that not even then did
we stop the campaign.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I'm telling you that a great number of high
school students and graduates were needed to work in the country's defense, public
administration and activities of all kinds. So that, although the gates of the university
were opened, we didn't have enough high school graduates to bring to the universities. It
was necessary to carry out huge teacher training programs; huge plans for the construction
of small schools, especially in the countryside and in the mountains, the first ones to be
built there, for the elementary education of our children. The needs of grade education
were covered quite quickly, and sometimes the school was in a <i>bohío</i> [rustic Cuban
dwelling] or even under a tree, because that was where the lessons were being taught. We
had learned in the mountains that people could be taught even in the forest.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Afterwards, they began finishing the sixth
grade en masse. We had to deal with the tremendous problem of overageness until we managed
to match the children's ages with the proper school level. Many years went by before we
totally achieved this. And after the sixth grade, they massively began secondary school,
but there were not enough schools. There were years when the Revolution built more than
100 junior high schools, with room for 50,000 new students. But when we finally had the
schools, we still did not have enough teachers for them. Once again, the Revolution had to
resort to high school students, to young people, to recruit them to work as junior high
school teachers, which required a certain level, and we had to set up a study and work
system with the teachers-in-training. In other words, those students devoted part of their
time to studying to be teachers and another part to teaching junior high students. It was
a very long road.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At the time, statistics talked about how
many teachers had degrees; for example, how many of those who were teaching had their
teacher's degree already. And there were times during those first years-which coincided
with a baby boom which had started at the triumph of the Revolution&#151;when for every
100 grade school teachers, if I remember well, 70 did not have a degree. Afterwards,
another statistical figure was added to this, the headache of every year: how many junior
high school teachers and how many high school teachers held a degree.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This also happened at university level,
because they took away our university professors. They lured them away, opened up their
doors to them so that a country as rich as the United States, which could pay much higher
salaries, could take them away. We accepted this challenge, we allowed those who wanted to
leave to do so. They took away half of our doctors that same way, of which we had 6,000
then.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We could not graduate doctors massively. We
had to wait until we had enough high school graduates, and to have enough high school
graduates we had to advance en masse to junior high school and then to high school, to
build again and again, to graduate teachers again and again; to turn recently graduated
students into university teachers from among those with the best academic record, and to
set up faculties everywhere. At first, university education existed in only two or three
places in Cuba. Afterwards, higher education extended to the whole country. Even when the
6 former provinces turned into 14, there were already higher learning institution in each
of those 14 provinces. And for medical studies, for example, 21 faculties were created.
The City of Havana alone had several. I don't remember if 5 or 6, others had 2, and the
smaller ones at least one university faculty. That was how we attained the current figure
of 60,000 medical doctors.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When one compares those times with these,
in which each province, no matter how small, prepares its own doctors and even its own
specialists, we realize the progress that has been made. They say that success makes
people forget. Sometimes it is good to remember that the road traveled to reach what we
have now was a long one. Yet, to us it seems short, because we know that we still have
quite a lot to do.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then came the times of those who sought a
degree higher than that of a bachelor's: a master's degree, a doctor's degree, of which we
have, how many? I wouldn&#146;t dare to quote now an exact figure&#151;I don&#146;t know
if Rosa Elena is around or someone who can help me out on this (<i>He refers to Rosa Elena
Simeón, Minister for Science, Technology and the Environment)</i>, or one of those
diviners that were over there&#151;but doctors or those with postgraduate degrees, I would
venture to say number more than 10,000.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">(<i>They tell him there are 4,000.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">¿There are 4,000? How far off I was! There
are 4,000 what, doctors? Are masters included in that figure? (<i>They tell him no.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Isn't that higher than a bachelor's degree?
(<i>They tell him yes.</i>) Well, yes, I didn't mean so many doctors, I meant postgraduate
degrees. (<i>They tell him it must be around 11,000 and 12,000.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They say 11,000. It turns out that I came
close but fell short. (<i>Laughter.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Eleven plus four equals fifteen, doesn't
it? That's what I'm trying to put together, the eleven plus the four. (<i>Laughter.</i>).
The eleven masters plus the four doctors multiplied times 1,000, of course, to simplify
matters.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Yes it is a large figure, but more are
getting ready to obtain these degrees.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Among the 29,000 teachers I mentioned, I
did not include university teachers, who were very few. Right now higher education must
have more than 20 thousand teachers, more than 20.000! Vecino is around, maybe he says no,
or yes? What is it, Vecino? [<i>In reference to Fernando Vecino, Minister for Higher
Education.</i>] Say it out loud so everyone can hear you.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">(<i>Vecino answers that 21,000.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, that's OK, it is better to fall short
than to exaggerate. (<i>Laughter.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I know they have quite enough, and more
than once I have asked them: Listen, how many teachers are you planning to have? And they
always defend the thesis of having as many as possible; because nobody is ever in excess
anywhere. We learned that from the teachers themselves, after that story I told you about.
The time came when all the teachers were graduates, and the time came when instead of
studying to be a teacher after finishing the 6th grade, they had to have their junior high
diploma, and the time came when instead of junior high students, high school graduates
were the ones who entered teachers colleges. Today, teachers-in-training enter with that
level and they have to study for five years in order to become a grade school teacher. At
present, they have to study the same number of years as those studying to be junior or
senior high school teachers.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There came a time when we had so many
teachers that we could afford creating a reserve of teachers. What for? So that the rest
of the teachers could study, and then those who had started studying to be teachers after
the sixth grade could obtain even a university degree, and they were paid their salaries
for several years, in full, so that they could study, and many of them became bachelors.
That is, the level of all the teachers gradually became the same. That way they gradually
gathered experience. That is why it is fair to say that our teachers should be the first
to be acknowledged. (<i>Applause.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The country did all it could and is doing
all it can in matters of education. And it has been able to maintain what we have despite
the worsening of the blockade. And when we lost our markets&#151;as Gómez pointed out
here the first day&#151;we had to suffer a double blockade. How did we manage to bear
this? Well, thanks to the people, our people, that well-instructed and patriotic people,
who has played the leading role in this epic struggle for almost 40 years. But not even in
those difficult moments was a classroom or a student left without a teacher. It did not
matter if it were only five, six or seven children, those calculations were never made, if
they lived in a remote place, they had a teacher there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I will not mention&#151;it would be too
lengthy&#151;the great variety of institutions created to train teachers, we could as well
say to train professionals of all sorts, in the whole country. That, thanks to the effort
of our people and because it is a sacred duty of the Revolution. We don't even deserve to
be thanked. In any event, thank the people for being revolutionary, because none of this
would have been possible without a Revolution, frankly. (<i>Applause.</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am not exhorting you to carry out a
revolution. We don't want to be accused of promoting subversion. Besides, it is not
necessary, neoliberalization is promoting it far better than us (<i>Applause.</i>),
poverty, abandonment.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have told you this long story, which led
to us having from 250,000 to 300,000 teachers today... And there aren't more because,
logically, teachers were also sought after, because, since they had a high educational
level, oftentimes the administration, the economic enterprises, tried to lure them away,
because teachers were knowledgeable. That was another struggle. That is why we had to
train so many teachers.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But the fact that today, counting special
education and initial and preschool education, there are almost 40,000 teachers, double
the amount teaching in the whole country before, gives a clear idea of the effort that has
been made. They teach children of up to six years of age, or a bit more, if you will,
because now in special schools they are a little older; but without counting teachers of
the first grade, second grade, of the rest of the educational system.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In initial and preschool education there
are around 25,000 teachers, in day-care centers, classrooms, etc. In special education,
there are 13,500, which add up to 38,000, if the arithmetic they taught me is any good. If
one compares this figure with the total number of teachers in the country before, one can
see the effort made in this respect. And when I say this I don't mean to be boastful. On
the contrary, we are rather critical of, and not fully satisfied with, what we have done.
I say it to try to explain the efforts the Revolution has made in this field, to explain
it to you, who in your vast majority come from Latin America, where in almost 200 years of
independence it has not been possible to completely eradicate illiteracy. You know that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You have come here to talk about these two
basic topics: special education and initial and preschool education, I don't want make
this too lengthy, but I was pondering about certain things that evidence the progress
made. I was meditating, for instance, about the fact that at the triumph of the
Revolution, only 134 pupils were enrolled in special education. I am sure that in other
Latin American sister countries, if not so few, there might be a similar situation in some
of them. One hundred and thirty-four, compared to fifty-seven thousand that our country
has today! If you multiply 134 times 400, I believe it comes close to the figure of 57,000
students that we have in special schools, the 425 institutions already mentioned here.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Unfortunately, the debacle of the socialist
camp takes place, the loss of our markets, we enter the special period, when we were
carrying out a huge program for the construction of day-care centers and special schools.
You have seen some of them. We had a complete program for the whole country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Sometimes these schools are housed in
facilities that are not perfect. Oh!, a school for deaf and dumb children, for example, is
a school which requires a laboratory, requires equipment, requires a lot of teaching aids,
a well-built school, appropriate facilities. These were designed for that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Schools for amblyopic children&#151;which
are not the blind children&#151;have to be especially designed. We, who have visited them
on several occasions, see the many playing grounds that they have. It is impossible,
impossible!, to bring together in another school the different means that these schools
have. These are children whose sight is saved, because many of them have problems which,
if not attended, could make them lose their sight. The schools for blind and visually
impaired children also require very special facilities and equipment. I marvel at what
those children learn and are able to do afterwards in those very humane schools.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We also have some schools for blind adults,
which prepare them to carry out many different tasks. They are particularly impressive.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Unfortunately, there are some very sad
diseases which deprive children of their eyesight, such as the well-known eye tumor
affecting some children. How terribly the families suffer in those cases!, when a child in
two or three years becomes blind, even if he is saved. That child has to be saved, in the
first place, treated in time so that the disease cannot progress, and if it does progress,
operated on so that it does not spread to the rest of the body, and later educated so as
to feel useful and happy. That constitutes the great success, that constitutes the great
feat: to make that child, who was once able to see, feel happy with time. Sometimes they
are four years old or a little older and perhaps many of them can remember when they were
able to see.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Some of them are born blind, were never
able to see. I suppose adaptation is more natural for them. Now, is there anything more
humane than teaching that child, for example? This requires facilities, and we wanted all
the facilities for special schools to be modern, with all the necessary equipment. That
program had to be interrupted, but the schools were created very early wherever we were
able to.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Schools for mentally retarded children do
not need such special facilities, or schools for children with slow mental development are
less complicated. These are topics that the specialists can discuss, if they send them to
one school or the other. I'm not very conversant with this topic, for example, of cases of
slow psychic development. I suppose they have discussed it and are discussing it; but I
have absolutely no doubts that mentally retarded children require special schools, require
special attention, I haven't the slightest doubt. Concerning the other ones, the
specialists ought to know. They have defended them a lot. They have the resources and it
is something transitory.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are also schools which have students
that need special treatment. But as a matter of opinion, it has to be determined if
students with behavior problems, for example, should be there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Sometimes we hear complaints from parents
of students in relation to cases of children with behavior problems in a common, ordinary
school. I know some special schools for adolescents with marked behavior problems. I have
talked to these children, I have seen them, many of them quite intelligent, quite likable.
These schools have been successful with them. These are the fruits of good pedagogy.
That's what it is for, to transform children who might have a tendency to violence, or
another negative tendency. That's what it exists for. In special schools for children with
behavior disorders, there are around 2,000 students, according to what I have seen in the
enrollment data, a little over than 2,000.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">With eyesight problems, blind or severely
visually impaired children, those who cannot see, there are around 1,000 enrolled in these
schools. In schools for the deaf and dumb, there are around 2,000. If we add the deaf and
dumb students with the visually impaired or blind students and with those that suffer from
amblyopia or strabismus, we get around 4,000; mentally retarded, around 29,000 and some
odds, with problems in their psychic development, around 20,000; those with language
disorders, around 600.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All these schools, the more modern, were
being built by us, especially those requiring particularly specialized facilities. And we
got to build a number of them in the different provinces. We also wanted the facilities
for the rest of the special schools to be optimal. We were forced to interrupt that
program, but we will continue it some day and we will have optimal facilities. Meanwhile,
we confront the country's total needs using the best facilities available in each place.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In these special schools, there is a
teacher for every four students-I don't think I'm wrong, there are 13,500 specialized
teachers devoted to that noble and very humane work. I believe in some schools the number
of teachers per student is greater-; but in our country there are teachers that even go to
hospitals or to the students' homes at certain moments to attend the children that may
need them for some reason.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was asking myself, what else can we do?
What else can the Revolution do? Well, we would have to begin earlier, begin to educate
the children before they are born. There is a formula: to educate the parents, to educate
the mothers, the mothers-to-be. So there's still more to be done. Right now, they are well
attended: 9 or 10 visits to the doctor during pregnancy, hospitalized childbirth in almost
one hundred percent of the cases. But I haven't heard about courses or programs to teach
them to be mothers. Because it would be useful for them to know what to do from the first
few months to contribute to these programs of initial education.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I think that special education, one of the
main topics you have analyzed these last few days, is an extra-ordinarily humane thing. I
think that no state, no government with any resources, should refrain from fulfilling this
basic duty. Do all children who need this type of teaching in the United States by any
chance have it? And it is the richest country in the world, with a Gross Domestic Product
of from 8 to 10 trillion dollars. The problem then lies in the system, not anywhere else.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I didn't come here to campaign for any
system. I'm simply asserting my point of view that the problem lies in the system: a
system educated in lies and which educates in lies, an alienating system which educates
the masses in selfishness, in individualism, in the antithesis of society. It can't do
otherwise, because that's the way the system is designed. And no one designed it, it was a
product of history, of the development of human society, which went through other systems
that were very harsh too. They say that worse than this one, but it is very hard to
imagine one worse than this one we know.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I don't know if feudalism could have been
worse. One can't be completely sure, because in the times of feudalism there were castles,
feudal lords and all of those things, but a globalized economy did not exist,
neoliberalization did not exist and feudal lords took care of their serfs, it wasn't
convenient for them that their serfs should die from hunger or disease. The capitalist
monopoly does not care if workers die, what happens to them, about their lot. There is
always a reserve of unemployed workers to replace them, or immigrants when they're needed,
or of countries with cheap labor where they can intervene.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The slave masters of the system prior to
feudalism in history, or in the modern age, after the conquest of America, took care of
their slaves. They were their property and as such they took care of them. Workers are a
property in this modern capitalist world. Because that's the way they are treated. The
work force is bought, or sold, or laid off, or fired, a phenomenon which occurs even in
highly industrialized countries, with a rate of unemployment of more than 10%, quite high;
some with more, with 12% or higher. It is an insoluble dilemma: the more they develop and
the more they apply new technology, the more unemployment they have, they do not solve and
cannot solve that contradiction.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Such a system does not look after people or
care about people. Lies and more lies, yes; that yes. And we know this quite well, because
for many years now we have been fighting against the lies that these gentlemen disseminate
throughout the world against the country which has done the most for man, which has done
the most for mankind, not only for children, but also for the elderly, not only for the
offsprings but also for their fathers and their mothers; and not only for men but also and
very much so for women, everything that has been possible, without being able to achieve
all that we would want to. We see the growing enthusiasm and awareness with which women
are struggling in the world today and their achievements, even certain laws in Europe and
the very United States, as a result of their struggle.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What Cuba has done for the human being, it
has done with extraordinarily humane methods. In this blockaded country, there has never
been a case of a banished person throughout its history; in this blockaded country, there
are no death squads, which even kill children who live in the streets; in this blockaded
country, no one can mention a single case of political assassination. And something else,
as I tell many people: in this country, which struggles against that empire, there is not
a single case of torture, not a single case, yet this country is taken to the human rights
commission to be tried. Who? The culprits of all the calamities the world is suffering
today, the culprits of the 30,000 banished in Argentina (<i>Applause.</i>), of the
thousands banished and murdered in Chile (<i>Applause.</i>), and of the 100,000 banished
and almost 50,000 murdered in Guatemala (<i>Applause.</i>), a country where the category
of prisoner was not known.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today everyone knows who caused all that,
who instructed the repressive forces of those countries in the art of torture and murder.
The manuals existed up to very recently, until someone brought these manuals to light and
these &quot;angels&quot; champions of human rights became so ashamed that they suppressed
the manual. I think they burned it. But to no avail: the system they defend engenders
violence, engenders injustice, engenders murder, because it is not inspired in the
slightest sense of humanity.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is the cause, the system, you cannot
blame people or individuals.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Moreover, they own the media. You Latin
Americans know it well, but the Europeans know it too. Over there, the serials on T.V. are
made in the United States, and the movies, almost all those shown in European movie
theaters&#151;I'm not talking about Latin America, because in Latin America we could say
it is all of them&#151;; in Europe a very high percentage of the movies shown come from
the United States, and they take their ideology, their doctrine over there. The same thing
occurs in most countries of the Third World, dazzling people in places where hunger reigns
and everything is lacking, advertising luxurious cars, jewels, dresses, the consumer
society.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What sense is there in taking to Africa
their model of a squandering consumer society, to places where people don't even have a
shack, or a teacher, where millions of people die every year for lack of medical care?
That is the type of propaganda they take there through their powerful media: television,
movies, magazines and others.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In our continent, what is the situation of
the Latin American film and television industries? Where do they prepare all that material
and what is shown? Teachers educating on the one hand and the American movies, serials and
advertisements spoiling people on the other, filling their brains with impossible
ambitions, like they do in the rest of the world, with a humanity numbering 6 billion
people and nature being destroyed by the savage aggression that such a system and its
economic mechanisms have imposed on the planet.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now they have discovered, guess what. In
recent years, two or three years ago, they began speaking about education and health care,
at this stage, gentlemen!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I've told you about all the trouble we went
through when we began&#151;and we had more or less the same situation as the rest of the
countries of the hemisphere&#151;and now the World Bank speaks, and they meet at a summit
in Rio and speak about health and education. When what they impose on governments is
budgetary restrictions, and the first budget they cut is that of education and health
care. (<i>Applause.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How can they speak about education and
health care when they have cut budgets to a minimum, when they want to cut pensions, when
they want to cut unemployment benefits, when they want to forget about the elderly, the
retired, everywhere?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Neoliberalization is an offensive against
all the achievements that even within capitalism the masses, the working class, the
workers had attained, especially after the Second World War, because the socialist
countries existed and they were afraid, they were waging a desperate struggle against
revolutionary changes. When the socialist camp and the USSR disappeared, they lost their
fear, and to what extent! They want to do away with every social achievement attained by
the peoples.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They have even done away with trade unions.
There are countries in Europe where the number of active workers in trade unions do not
reach 10%. They're destroying the instruments the poor have to defend themselves.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They were the ones who taught all the most
brutal and repressive measures the world has suffered in its social struggles. They were
the teachers, the advocators of the system and the promoters of this neoliberalization.
And they are the ones who tell the IMF and the World Bank what they have to impose on the
different countries, only that now it is practiced at a world, global and total level.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You have very wisely, very progressively
and I would dare say, if it doesn't harm you, very revolutionarily expressed the idea of
the globalization of solidarity and the need for support among the peoples. Actually, the
system that prevails is that of anti-solidarity and it is leading the world to the
dead-end street of the brutal neoliberal globalization. Of course, this will only lead it
to a crisis, inevitably, the system cannot be saved, and the longer they walk along that
road the less possibility they'll have of being saved. This will force people from all
over to fight, it will spur the masses to fight. That is why awareness is so important.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You have proposed: to build awareness in
States and governments in order that they pay attention to health care, in order that they
pay attention to education, and I have just told you that, hypocritically, they have
spoken about these issues. But they have to talk about twenty other issues also, these are
not the only ones, understand? They have to talk about employment, they have to talk about
housing, they have to talk about drinking water, they have to talk about food and they
have to talk about the environment. Because guided by the blind laws of the market, they
destroy arable lands, they destroy drinking water, they destroy nature, they destroy the
atmosphere, they destroy the seas, a very important source of food for the world, they
destroy everything.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The world is not going to follow that road.
The world is learning a lot and even the illiterate learn. And we have gone through that
experience, because in our struggle a considerable part of the peasants that we found in
the mountains were illiterate, and they understood what the Revolution was, they realized
it. Who taught them? Capitalism did: the abuses, the injustices, the outrage, the
evictions, that's who. And they are also teaching the world. It's encouraging to see how
the world is learning, and we see this in the international meetings.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">And what is the World Bank going to do? Are
they going to lend money so that schools can be built? And then the budget for those
schools? How much will have to be paid for that money? Because all these Latin American
countries, for example, already owe 600 billion dollars.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I want you to know that when the Cuban
Revolution triumphed, there was hardly any foreign debt in Latin America, a few thousands
if any, perhaps less than 10 billion, and today it's 600 billion. Oh, so they're going to
lend! What they ought to do is donate, not lend but donate! and really donate.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What did these gentlemen from the North and
their representatives say in the Santiago summit? Oh, that education must be worked for.
But, where are the resources? They go to Africa and they say the same thing. But, where
are the resources?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At the United Nations they one day agreed
to request 0.7% of the Gross Domestic Product of rich countries to help development, a
figure which would contribute to end illiteracy, to promote health care programs,
education and the economic development of the Third World. There is a country, Norway,
which contributes with nearly 0.9% and they are planning to raise it to 1%. If every
industrialized country gave 1%, it would mean 200 billion per year, and then a program
could be devised. But do you know what the rich countries are doing? They're reducing
their development assistance. It decreases every year. This year it only reaches 0.22%,
some time ago it was 0.34%. Development aid is decreasing, not the loans to indebt the
countries or to increase the transnationals' income, not the investments of big financial
capital; all the contrary, these grow.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of all industrialized countries, the United
States is the one with the lowest contribution to development aid. I think it is 0.08,
that is, below 0.1%. I know that the average figure for development assistance contributed
by the rich countries is 0.22. And it is no less than the champion of democracy and human
rights, a country where there are people with up to 50 billion dollars; in a world where
378 rich people own as much money as what 2.6 billion people earn in one year. Three
hundred and seventy-eight rich people as compared to 2.6 billion people. That's the world
they are promising; that's the heaven they promise; that's what neoliberal globalization
promises: some countries growing richer, and the rest growing poorer, and within each
country, an increasingly richer minority and an increasingly poorer majority. That
difference grows between different countries and also within the countries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If they want to talk to us about education
and health care; if they want to talk to us about a humane, fair world; if they want to
talk about a really democratic world, let them renounce their system, let their plundering
stop, let the exploitation of man by man cease and the exploitation of poor countries by
the rich ones, and let human beings be brothers and sisters and not wild animals devouring
one another or fighting for bread crumbs.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">And this is partly what you say, when you
request that States and governments become aware and pay attention to at least education,
health care and other social issues. But they're not going to do it&#151;that's something
that can be assured&#151;and they could very easily do it with all the money they have.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There was that question by the Chilean
comrade with her unaffected remarks when she asked how it was possible that a poor country
like Cuba was able to do it. And she also made reference to last night's performance. I
wasn't able to attend, but I have spoken to several persons and they have told me that
they were very impressed with this performance, where children from ordinary schools
mingled with children from the special school &quot;Solidarity with Panama&quot;. (<i>Applause.</i>)
The mere name of that school reminds us of one of the empire's barbarous acts when it
invaded that country and killed who knows how many people. They didn't even rebuild the
houses that they destroyed with their bombs. We could suggest that they build at least one
school like &quot;Solidarity with Panama&quot;, so that children with physical or walking
limitations can have the education of the children you saw last night. I think this would
be a good example of the type of integration we should strive for, the type of integration
we should strive for! (<i>Applause.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There isn't any dogma. Let us always look
for the best and let us learn to find the best. Let us perfect what we are doing as
researchers test and advance. Because one of the things I have liked most is having been
able to confirm in the documents matter and in what has been said here how hard you have
worked in pedagogical research and how new concepts have been arrived at, and this was not
done overnight.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Preschool education began here practically
for another purpose: due to the day-care centers that were established to help working
mothers.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now that I mention the day-care centers, I
remember that we also had a program for building new day-care centers along with the
special schools I talked about before. It is enough to say that, at the time, in only one
year we built in Havana 110 day-care centers each for 200 children, and that same year
other day-care centers were built in other parts of the country, something which we
unfortunately cannot do now. We had more resources before, we had more trade, we had
better prices for our products, before the situation that came later. But what we did make
we will defend tooth and nail.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At present we have around 160,000 children
in day-care centers. (<i>Someone mentions a figure concerning the day-care centers.</i>)
There are one thousand and some odd day-care centers, I know, but I don't want to fill the
audience's head with exact figures, I'm giving approximate figures. We began the day-care
centers to help working mothers, then we discovered that they were a wonderful institution
to prepare children for school. Some preschool classrooms already existed, a few. These
preschool classrooms were developed as much as possible. Today we have around five
thousand and some odd or 5,200 preschool classrooms&#151;I've seen it in some
papers&#151;in addition to the more than 1000 day-care centers. But I was very impressed,
I sincerely mean it, by the 27,000 informal school-initiation groups.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You used two different words: informal or
non-institutional, and they say that there were 886 children in that program, and also
that more than 90% of the possible children are involved-somebody said 98%. You said half
of those groups were in the rural sector. I am very impressed, I didn't know that figure.
I know you people have continued working in education, but that figure is impressive, the
idea, the creativity shown by that figure.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There was a paragraph there that filled me
with pride, not Cuban pride, we are not and we cannot be chauvinistic. I was full of
revolutionary pride when they said Cuba held the highest place among all the countries,
concerning initial and preschool education, which was the other issue you discussed here.
(<i>Applause.</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was content to see clearly now that,
based on those modest efforts of the first few years, initial and preschool education
constitute today an education system. You have turned that type of education, that
attention to children up to six years of age, into a system, and you have proved, besides,
that what is needed is the human being, what is needed is the teacher.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You spoke about needing a tripod to reach
this lofty goal, but not a tripod for a machine gun, a tripod for teaching, for peace, the
tripod made up of the teacher, the family and the community.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Believe me, I learned a lot when I saw that
material, because it is a beautiful idea, a concept and a clear, synthetic explanation
about that work and the reason for having reached such a high percentage of benefitted
children. Those groups are actually a creation of our pedagogues. It wasn't the
Revolution. When the Revolution triumphed, it didn't even dream of this. In those times
all our efforts were focused on illiteracy and on the other problems; but these are those
ideas in full development and evolution.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is why, dear friends who are visiting
us, we defend and will defend with such determination the work and the achievements of the
Revolution. (<i>Applause.</i>) That is why we are not dismayed by what our powerful enemy
might do or by his blockade, that is why we are not discouraged by its slander, its
campaigns and its infamous propaganda, its revolting lies, because they cannot block out
the sun with one finger. They would not be able to discuss things here, you might invite
many of these gentlemen to a meeting such as this one, and you can be sure, because I have
seen them, they try to sneak in unseen, through a small door, they say a few words and run
off. Debate? Oh, no, no debate, that would be too much. These &quot;great statesmen&quot;
want no part of it. They prefer a speech, which can be very idyllic, without any
reasoning.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It would please us if they could explain a
few things to you here, among them, the things that occur in Europe; but not in Europe, in
Europe they are more advanced socially than the United States, a lot more advanced. Of
course, neoliberalization wants to impose its rules there too, but these are developed
countries, they can defend themselves better. Now they are joining forces to defend
themselves; but they have a lot of problems over there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Among other things, I recently read that
the number of mothers who are heads of the family, be it because they are single mothers,
be it because they are divorced, be it because they are widows, for whatever reason, the
percentage of mothers who have to quit their jobs to care for their children due to a lack
of day-care centers has grown 60%. In that same text, I read that a mother in the United
States must pay 500 dollars a month for day-care services.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Here we charge a small fee, according to
the exchange rate that they mention, because they like to mention things that are not
real, when they say that salaries are very low. Yes, they are low. We don't deny it, but
rather than decreasing, they have lost purchasing power. This could be best understood if
I say that we have less material resources to give in exchange for those salaries. Many of
these resources were formerly distributed as equitably as possible, a large part of them
subsidized by the State.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They don't take at all into account that,
for example, 85% of Cuban families own their houses thanks to revolutionary laws. For a
house such as these, any American citizen has to pay 1,000 dollars a month or more. Even
those who own their houses have to pay very high taxes. Home owners don't even have to pay
taxes here.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, they are accustomed to using the
international exchange rate with the dollar, as they do in many countries, to assess the
purchasing power of salaries. Using that same arbitrary method, what people pay for
day-care services here is less than two dollars a month, less than two dollars! Day-care
centers are totally subsidized, and the reason for charging a small fee for day-care
services was rather symbolic and educative, due to the great demand for them even from
people that didn't really need them, since they had other possibilities within their
families. Each day-care center also has its own doctor.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have referred to the critical situation
of day-care centers in the United states. To be honest, I must say that this U.S.
president, who can, of course, be very rightly criticized, has tried to implement some
social programs in that country, but they wouldn't let him.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">He recently spoke about the need for a
program to build day-care centers to solve the problem of mothers who have to quit their
jobs because they cannot pay the day-care center, plus the house, plus all the other
expenses they have. But he hasn't been able to. The system has prevented it. He couldn't
do even that. He had some other ideas, a bit more progressive, but he hasn't been able to
implement them. It's that the right wing is strong in the U.S. Congress and it opposes any
such measures.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As a matter of fact, he made a statement
today&#151;I read it in the cables&#151;which called my attention: he declared that the
United States cannot continue applying unilateral sanctions. That it has become the
country that imposes most sanctions in the world, and is in the habit of sanctioning any
nation. I believe this was meant as a sort of challenge to excessively rightist trends
over there and perhaps as a revenge&#151;preaching in that desert&#151;for the obstacles
they have put to his plans of introducing some social improvements.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A curious thing: he declared that food
should not be an object of sanctions. He should have added some other things, medicines;
he should have said no country should be subjected to economic blockade, because it is a
genocidal act, a murderous act. (<i>Applause.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Right now, they're discussing in Rome the
creation of an international criminal court to judge war crimes, and many countries have
proposed different things. UNICEF has even proposed that rape or sexual abuse of minors be
considered war crimes.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is much discussion there because the
United States wants that court to be subordinated to the Security Council. There are five
permanent members in that U.N. body, all nuclear powers and with the right to veto.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The United Nations Organization is an
institution necessary for humanity, which must play an increasingly important role as the
globalizing process develops. But the Security Council has usurped functions that must
entirely belong to the General Assembly, where all the countries of the world are
represented, and the presence of five permanent members with the power of veto in that
Council, works against the democratic character of the United Nations. The decision of one
single permanent member is enough to annul any agreement of the General Assembly.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">On the issue of the blockade against Cuba,
around 150 nations voted in the General Assembly in favor of the Cuban resolution against
the blockade. Only three countries, including the United States, voted against it. Just
look at the difference, 3 to 150. Others abstain. To abstain is actually an expression of
disagreement with the U.S. policy towards Cuba. Not everyone dares to defy the United
States by openly expressing in favor of a resolution that opposes such policy, for fear of
all sorts of reprisals that may be taken against them. The United States becomes furious
when it is contradicted on this sensitive issue. Despite all this, there are many people
who dare to defy their fury.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our delegation, which is in Rome, is going
to propose that the economic blockade against any country be classified and penalized as a
war crime. (<i>Applause.</i>) It will be proposed there. Yes sir, the blockade is so cruel
and unjust that it constitutes a genocide. The attempt to subdue a country by hunger and
illness is a great crime against humanity, and it must be prohibited, condemned and tried
as such.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We totally support the creation of that
court; of an independent court, not as the United States wants it subordinated to the
Security Council. No, not there, where they have the right to veto, so often used by the
United States, more often than all the permanent members put together. If a court to try
war crimes is to be created, it must be absolutely independent. (<i>Applause.</i>) It
would really be a good thing.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I made this parenthesis to acknowledge, all
things considered, some of the positive things about the current U.S. President. That
declaration I read today is important, I found it constructive, even courageous. How will
it be heeded by the reactionary right? Not at all! He can do nothing, or very little.
Neither can the U.S. govern-ment control the laws which govern a globalization process in
which it believes and for which it fights. The system it promotes is subject to the blind
laws of the market. They are the ones who really rule the world. A savage beast rules the
world: the market, and it is inexorably leading it to neoliberal globalization.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Going back to our subject, as I was saying,
how much does it cost to do those things we spoke about when we analyzed the achievements
attained in our country in relation to initial and preschool education? How much has it
cost, let us say, to turn this education into a system?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What does it cost to organize those
informal groups to attend children in initial education? Yes, a considerable number of
teachers is necessary, but not great investments, not at all. It costs very little. Of
course, many other things will have to be done before attaining the great progress
achieved by Cuba in the field of education. In the first place, millions and millions of
teachers would have to be trained. The ones that exist in Latin America today would not be
enough. Perhaps they would need twice or thrice that amount if they were to devise an
education program like the one our country fortunately has and defends under very
difficult circumstances.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Nobody is going to fool anybody here,
except those who want to be fooled. There is a very popular proverb meaning that the worst
blind is he who does not want to see.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are some adults that need, let's say,
special education, (<i>Laughter and applause.</i>) there are some who need to take lessons
on ethics in order not to be so selfish and to understand what the capitalist system
stands for. A rich, developed, capitalist country has its appeal, for whom? For the
privileged millionaire class of those countries and also for the hundreds of millions of
people with low incomes or without employment in the Third World countries. There are also
those who are dazzled by the news and advertisements of the consumer societies. If the
United States had done with the rest of Latin America what it did with Cuba, that is,
leave its doors wide open for all who wanted to go to that country which was and is the
most developed and rich country in the world, a challenge which the Revolution was able to
face with great dignity and heroism. If they took away doctors, professors, highly trained
professionals, technicians and skilled workers, our response was to massively train
doctors, professors, professionals, technicians and skilled workers; and, above all, form
them as patriots. &quot;Let there be freedom to emigrate&quot;, we said.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The average salary of a worker in the
United States is thirty times the minimum salary of a Latin American worker. If they had
opened the doors to the whole impoverished continent sacked by imperialism, more than half
the population of the United States would be made up of Latin American and Caribbean
people. How great!, I mean, at least wealth would be better distributed in this
hemisphere. But they are building a gigantic wall in the Mexico-U.S. border to prevent the
immigration of people from the south. There are no open doors or automatic residence for
them. The ruling class in the United States does not want to taint the pure, Anglo-Saxon
and Aryan, European and white blood of the majority of the population of that country, and
lives in fear because their black population multiplies faster and so do the Latin
Americans.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Yes, there is a tremendous economic
immigration pressure. If the Chinese had been given the facilities given the Cubans, who
by simply stepping on U.S. soil, without a visa, without a passport, without anything,
received their residence automatically, how many Chinese would there be in the United
States? Or Indians from India? I am not referring to our natives [also called Indians].</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They try to present as a virtue of the
system-the system that has exploited and plundered-as an attraction of the system, the
material needs of billions of people in the world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The road for you and for the countries of
the Third World is a long one, I believe, a very long road; but, still, things can be done
along the way.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Why has a hemisphere whose independence was
obtained at the beginning of last century fallen so far behind? The first declaration of
independence dates back to 1812, one of the first; well, actually the first one was
Haiti's, during the French Revolution, but Venezuela's was in 1812, and the countries
gradually became independent during the period until the battle of Ayacucho. Let us say
that in approximately 20 years, maybe even less, two centuries of independence will have
passed. What did they do in Latin America-now I'm talking about our hemisphere- during
those almost 20 years? How many became millionaires by plundering the public treasury? How
many military dictatorships have our countries suffered? And who supported them?
Capitalism did, British imperialism first and later the imperialism which emerged in the
North, which after stripping Mexico of more than half of its territory, occupied the
Isthmus of Panama, took over Puerto Rico, frustrated Cuba's independence, set up a
military base in its territory, intervened in Central America and in all Latin American
countries of the Caribbean and politically controlled the rest of the continent which it
has sacked mercilessly. How could we make any progress?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Somoza, a famous tyrant, who put him in
Nicaragua and delivered that country to him upon the blood of Sandino and other Nicaraguan
patriots? They did.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Who placed Trujillo in power in one of
those interventions in the Dominican Republic? They did. Who placed in power all the
regimes of terror in this hemisphere and supported them, and maintained these countries
Balkanized? Who prevented their economic and social development? They did, and all of
those who allowed them to, and those who gave in to the empire, sometimes in a shameful
way. Because the mere fact of excluding Cuba from Latin American meetings&#151;as if we
were on Mars and not here in the Caribbean&#151;which responds to a sheer Yankee whim, is
a shame for this hemisphere. I won't say for all, because there are some countries that
oppose it. The Caribbean countries unanimously oppose it and some others in Latin America,
but the orders are really given by those gentlemen from the North. And I ask: what do they
want to punish Cuba for, a country that has so tenaciously and heroically resisted that
policy? We have things to say, things to do and things to expound in this world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have developed our internationalist
awareness and we are concerned with the problems not only of America and the Caribbean but
also of the whole world, and of Africa in particular. We shed our blood there fighting
against colonialism, fighting against apartheid.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As was mentioned here, 26,000 Cuban
teachers have rendered internationalist services. I'll tell you more: when Nicaragua
requested 2,000 teachers, 30,000 Cuban teachers volunteered to go. Many of them went to
the mountains to teach, not to Managua, but to the mountains of Nicaragua, in places where
you had to walk three days to get to. And when the counter-revolutionary bands, organized
by the United States, murdered some of those teachers, 100,000 Cuban teachers offered to
go, one hundred thousand! (<i>Applause.</i>). And the volumes with the signatures of those
100,000 teachers exist.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We did more than form teachers to go to our
mountains and our countryside, we formed teachers capable of going to anyplace in the
world, any mountain in the world, any plain in the world, even any desert in the world,
because in the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic many of our teachers have been teaching in
the desert for many years. And that is much more than forming teachers, that's forming the
human being as the human being should be, not a selfish, individualistic person. The truly
solidary human beings are those who go to any part of the world to teach, to promote
health or to shed their blood for a just cause.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Revolution has done more than that,
more than half a million Cubans have accomplished internationalist missions, despite being
a small, blockaded country. If you add all the peace missions or peace forces in the
United States, created after the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, and out of fear of the
Cuban Revolution, which was when they created their Peace Corps, Cuba alone, all by
itself, has sent abroad more people to teach, educate, work for other peoples, than the
United States since the famous Peace Corps were created. And if they don't believe it, let
one of them in that country so much given to statistics calculate it. Let them, with their
computers and all that, calculate it. I would be glad if they have the data and they
compare it with the more than half a million citizens of this country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Revolution's work is not limited to
material work, it has worked on people's consciousness, on their soul, preparing the human
being as the human being of tomorrow, of the future, should be, and fighting against the
lies, fighting against the dirtiest and gross propaganda, fighting against blockade and
fighting against the harassment that tries to weaken the Revolution, to weaken its morale,
its consciousness.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Some day history will have to analyze why
this people has been able to resist, a people which has a higher educational level than
any other Third World country, with an educational level even higher than many developed
countries. Because there is illiteracy in countries as developed as the United States, and
real illiteracy, of the type in which people don't know how to read or write, and also
functional illiteracy in which they cannot even read a newspaper.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We're not against globalization. You can't
be against it, it is a law of history. We're against neoliberal globalization, which they
want to impose on the world and which will be unsustainable, which will collapse and we
must help collapse, and in order to help we need consciousness, because consciousness is
essential. It is with a lot of consciousness that the work of the Revolution has been
carried out.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This has been a meeting&#151;with different
tasks, among them the scientific conferences&#151;which has had a curious characteristic:
it began with people speaking about poetry and poets and it has ended with people speaking
about poetry and poets. Gómez recalled Neruda when the latter spoke about the hope that
had emerged in Cuba and his trust that that hope would be maintained in our country. How
many years have gone by since he said that! And here it is, in such adverse, such
difficult conditions, in a world dominated by the United States, in a unipolar world. It
remains unflinching. I am sure Neruda could not have imagined what a difficult battle this
people would have to wage to get here.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In your declaration you spoke about
Gabriela Mistral &#151;I think you mentioned her twice, you and she (<i>Pointing to two
comrades that spoke before he did.</i>)&#151;her concepts and ideas about education, which
you have left with us as a legacy of this meeting. How glad we are that many of the things
she dreamed about have become true.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am not a poet and, therefore, my remarks
do not end with a poem but with a tribute and a homage to those who had such foresight, by
saying to Gabriela Mistral: &quot;Here, amid incredible difficulties that you couldn't
even have imagined, is the work of the Revolution, in this hemisphere and country which
are also yours, because Cuba considers itself a sister, a member-and this capacity no one
can take away from us-of the Latin American family.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">And by telling Neruda: &quot;Thank you for
your hopes for Cuba! We have not let you down, and we gladly and proudly bear the honor of
having resisted and having defended our ideas, which were also your ideas, much more than
what you perhaps imagined the day when you pronounced the noble words that so extol and
even now encourage our people, when you expressed your immense confidence in that recently
born revolution. We shall never betray that confidence nor that hope!&quot; (<i>Applause.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Honor and glory to all those who with
infinite selflessness and kindness work in special education, so necessary and so
extraordinarily humane! (<i>Applause.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Honor and glory to the teachers from
twenty-four countries who have participated in this meeting! (<i>Applause.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Honor and glory to the heroic Cuban
teachers! (<i>Applause.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We usually finish our speeches with two
phrases. I maintain these two phrases. I said them a very long time ago and in difficult
times they must be repeated even more, because I don't renounce any principle and I don't
even renounce a revolutionary phrase. (<i>Applause.</i>) That is why I usually say:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Socialism or Death!, but convinced that
there will be socialism, that socialism will triumph. (<i>Applause.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Motherland or Death!, an expression of our
determination, but absolutely convinced that our motherland will live on, a revolutionary
motherland, a socialist motherland. (<i>Applause.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We will win!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">(<i>Ovation.</i>)</font></p>
