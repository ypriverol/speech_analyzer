FIDEL CASTRO RUZ, FIRST SECRETARY OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CUBA
AND PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCILS OF STATE AND OF MINISTERS, AT THE CLOSING SESSION OF THE
12TH NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FORUM, HELD AT THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CENTER ON
21 NOVEMBER 1998, &quot;YEAR OF THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DECISIVE BATTLES OF THE
LIBERATION WAR&quot;</font></strong><font FACE="CG Times,Times New Roman" SIZE="4"></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font face="Arial" size="3">Comrades,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I promised to say a few words following
Comrade Miret&#146;s intervention to explain my absence from this forum.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Actually, a great number of activities
accumulated in the last few days. There were visiting heads of government that we should
receive and converse with as well as other personalities, not all of them reported by the
press. Many of said personalities are of great importance for a number of activities
taking place in our country at this moment, therefore, it was necessary to take some time
to attend to them.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are times when all things come
together, and before we realized it the forum was already upon us, at a time of year when
a lot of activities simply do not allow us the time, and there are still quite a few of
them pending. Time flies and in a few days there will be the Young Communist League's
Congress and a series of other events and meetings such as the National Assembly and
others.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite all these obligations, I would have
found time to be here with you for a few hours and take part in the debates during some
sessions. I have always been much interested in listening to all the opinions and
proposals expressed in these forum. I like to be well informed and involved so, when my
turn comes to speak, I can be well aware of the characteristics, the content and the
relevance of the presentations and debates.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have not missed a single forum since
1990. They used to be held annually. I remember when this event which began modestly as a
meeting on spare parts --a primary need then-- became what it is today, an extraordinary
science and technology movement. I liked the annual meetings but such efforts were
required that we felt it would be more rational to hold them every two years, so they are
biennial now. However, this first biennial forum I was unable to attend and take part in
the debates for the reasons I have explained. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The most important reason that prevented me
from been here is not related to my other obligations, those that are planned and those
that come up throughout the year since you can plan 50, 100, 200 activities and by the end
of the year you have had 400. Sometimes you need to sacrifice sleeping time or the time
usually taken to rest and to study; because we also need to study like you do, we have to
read and analyze information. Perhaps, we could have managed a few hours to participate in
the forum had it not been for the hurricanes that have been following one another. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">First, it was the notorious hurricane
George which swept across the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It also caused damage here,
quite a lot, because it followed an intense drought so aid had to be sent to many places,
as it is usually the case. Still, we gave a priority to the Dominican Republic and Haiti
that were badly stricken. They lack the experience we now have; they have not reached our
degree of organization to protect the population and the facilities.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Special attention was paid to obtaining
assistance for these countries, basically through diplomatic work. In this effort, we were
strengthened by the moral value of our stated position, in the sense that we preferred the
Dominican Republic and Haiti be given a priority because they were enduring more
suffering, they had sustained a harder blow.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We truly are better organized today, better
than ever before. It would be difficult to find another country as prepared as we are to
face all sorts of difficulties, and you are morally stronger when you solicit help for
others and work for others. We could never have imagined that just a few weeks later
another hurricane of exceptional characteristics would come along. Hurricane Mitch, which
has been considered one of the four most formidable in the century, posed a threat to us.
It was in the south of Cuba and almost every hurricane entering that zone at this time of
year turns north and comes through our country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That monster of a hurricane had sustained
winds of over 250 kilometers an hour and gusts over 300. Meteorologists now classify
hurricanes in the categories of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and some might be confused by these
categories. A category 1 hurricane has sustained winds over 100 kilometers an hour. When
the winds are stronger than 250 kilometers an hour, it is a category 5 hurricane. Anyone
might think that a category 5 hurricane causes five times more damage than a category 1
hurricane; it is a simple calculation, we are used to multiplying and dividing and anyone
could be misled. But the fact is that a category 5 hurricane --and this I learned quite
recently-- is 25 times more destructive than a category 1 hurricane. It is 25 times more
destructive!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This hurricane was coming our way and it
looked poised to hit the country right in the middle. It seemed like it was going to pass
west of Jamaica, through Camagüey; it was heading that way but then it turned west. It
was moving very slowly but it advanced with the winds gathering force because hurricanes
draw their strength mostly from the heat in the sea. Over the land they lose strength,
worn down by the friction and the irregular terrain. When they encounter high mountains
they break up quite a bit until they reorganize again but at sea they gather strength
immediately. This hurricane was coming along the Gulf Stream, which carries its energy
from the equatorial seas to Norway, and so you can imagine the kind of energy that stream
provided for this hurricane to grow stronger.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It was being carefully monitored. Even
though some people were getting tired because they had been mobilized for several days,
Rubiera [the head of the Meteorological Institute Forecast Department] insisted on it
because the only thing you can do in such situations is to adopt measures in advance; it
cannot be left to chance in the belief that it might not come near because no one can be
certain. The residents in the Pinar del Rio province were mobilized in case it hit there
but it went off west. There was even a moment when it began moving southwest.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The fact is that this highly unusual
hurricane remained stationary for a long time off the coast of Honduras and for as long as
it remained there, the risk existed that it would head north and assault Pinar del Rio. I
do not know what would have been left of the tobacco plantations and the tobacco drying
sheds in Pinar del Rio; and tobacco is one of the country's fastest growing export items.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have asked one of the experts here if we
could grow quality tobacco throughout the island and he has said yes. The country is
working towards a future production of 400 million cigars annually for export; they are in
high demand. Some of our cigars are sold to tourists in other Caribbean islands for 40 or
50 dollars each while we receive a dollar fifty or two dollars; still, it is a source of
revenue. Here, we do not sell them at such high prices although they are also sold to
tourists.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is a huge demand and it is a growing
sector so, if that hurricane had hit Pinar del Rio it would have caused tremendous damage.
Most of the raw material from the first quarter of the year, 15,000 tons of tobacco, are
in the drying process. The tobacco harvested in the first quarter of the year is being
processed there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, an amazing thing happened: that
hurricane remained stationary off the coast of Honduras for 58 hours. The little islands
in the vicinity were completely wiped out. But, the hurricane gradually lost energy
because using up the enormous energy needed to reach over 300 kilometers gusts it gets
spent and weakens --as an airplane flying at 1000, 1500, 2000 kilometers an hour which
uses much more energy than at 500-- and at such high speeds a certain amount of energy is
lost. But, the fact is that it remained for 58 hours off the coast of Honduras, and not
far from Nicaragua. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There were very heavy rains so the damage
was not so much caused by the winds --although the winds were strong enough to knock down
banana trees, houses and many other things but these were not winds of 200 or 150
kilometers an hour, there were times when the sustained winds were less than 100
kilometers an hour-- the damage was caused by the rain. It rained throughout all these
hours, and then it moved inland, losing force, until entering Guatemala.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then, it disappeared in the mountains of
Guatemala, the hurricane was said to have disappeared. Some 48 hours passed, and there was
Rubiera announcing that the hurricane was back, this time in the Gulf of Campeche. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The famous hurricane reappeared and I
clearly remember it was a beautiful day when the news was released that the hurricane was
gaining back its strength. It was heading northeast and no one knew how far away from us
it would pass or how much rain would fall, and this at a time when we were already feeling
far from any danger. Imagine that!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It passed about 170 kilometers from the
coast of Pinar del Rio so the rainfall was not very heavy and it did not cause any
considerable damage. But, I remember that when the Meteorological Institute was reporting
it 300 kilometers away from Cuba there were gusts of wind of up to 100 kilometers an hour
here, and 105 or 110 kilometers at the site of the weather bureau in Havana.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is worse when they are disorganized as
was the case with hurricane George which had three eyes when it left Haiti before it
reorganized again but with gusts of wind that could be felt 300 kilometers away. Hurricane
Mitch caused a real disaster; it is considered the worst natural disaster in Central
America in the last 200 years. Only watching the pictures of the destruction it brought to
these countries can anyone have an idea of what this means. Also because these are poor
countries. Honduras and Nicaragua, for example, are two of the poorest countries in the
Americas. Haiti may be number one in poverty, not only in this hemisphere but in the world
--not number one but it is among the poorest in the world-- but Honduras and Nicaragua,
the hardest hit, are among the poorest countries in Latin America and the Caribbean,
except for Haiti.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The rest are very poor, not as poor, but
very poor: Guatemala is a poor country, El Salvador is a poor country. They are also
threatened with another hurricane: the deportation of a large number of the so-called
undocumented Central American immigrants who live in the United States and send money home
to their families in Central America; they are being expelled.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There was this terrible destruction.
Everything was swept away in Honduras, not a single banana tree remained standing, not a
single crop left, nothing, and vast areas flooded. An average size river runs through the
capital, somewhat like Havana's Almendares River --and the Almendares used to give us
headaches with floods every year around the Rancho Boyeros highway before the Mamposton
dam was built-- and there, in Tegucigalpa, the amount of rain that fell was unimaginable.
Added to this is the fact that Central America has been heavily deforested, tens of
thousands of hectares of forests have been lost every year. Forests retain water but when
there are no forests the water runs to the rivers and so the flooding in the capital was
sudden and dreadful.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are two major factors about floods:
the amount of rainfall and the time period in which it falls. Look what happened with
hurricane George in the town of Mayari where people had to be evacuated --when the
hurricane was practically gone-- from places where there had never been any flooding so
they were not usually evacuated. At Mayari, a large town located on the highest bank of a
river that sometimes rises considerably, the people had to be evacuated under the rain. A
dam there had not been completed due to the <i>special period</i> but we plan to work on
it little by little until it is finished. The problem was that 300 millimeters of rain
fell in four hours, and 300 millimeters in four hours is quite different from 700
millimeters in 24 hours.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The same thing happened in the area of San
Nicolas, at the Havana province, a town that had never seen floods before. Some 300
millimeters of rain fell in just a few hours nearby, at the source of a stream, and the
same thing happened as in Mayari.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Nobody knows how much rain fell in Central
America. Watching the films makes you think it was not as much as during hurricane Flora
but, again, it does not have to be that much.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is not known yet for certain how much
rain fell during hurricane Flora. The estimate is 1600 millimeters; there were not many
check points then but there were a few and they registered 1500 and 2000 millimeters. The
width of the flooding and the current in the center of the Oriente province --and I was an
eyewitness-- was the same as the width at the mouth of the Amazon River, I mean, at the
point where the water from all the rivers converged. Today all those rivers have dams.
Before hurricane Flora they used to partly flood the Cauto Valley every year.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today, dams have been built in all those
rivers. Even in the Cauto river before it reaches the Central Highway. There is a dam near
Miranda and the Contramaestre river is dammed too. All the rivers that spilled over during
hurricane Flora, including those in Manzanillo and Granma provinces, now have dams. But
all that water --it was raining for 36 hours-- was flowing down the river which grew like
a sea wave, like a moving wall, in the early hours of morning and everyone was taken by
surprise. Some farmers thought it was the sea invading from the north of the Oriente
province. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Around 1200 people died at the time of
hurricane Flora. Today, they would not have died because every time a hurricane poses
risks, despite the dams that have been built, all the people living in the area are
evacuated. There is a high degree of organization, with everybody involved, together like
at this forum with discipline and all guaranteed, as Miret has said: 700,000 people were
evacuated during hurricane George, and that as a preventive measure.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, hurricane Mitch was highly unusual.
None of the countries affected can be criticized because the effects went beyond all
calculations. I was telling you about a river that flows through the capital of Honduras;
the rain caused the river to overflow and the flooding and mud-slides almost covered the
city, entire neighborhoods were completely wiped out.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was saying that deforestation contributed
to the damage caused by the hurricane. Various factors combined, really: the unusual
nature of the hurricane, the number of hours of rainfall and the deforested mountains,
since forests retain water. Thus, it is not just the amount of rainfall but the time in
which it falls, plus the capacity of these rivers&#146; sources to retain the water. If
the water can be retained for several hours, the flooding is not as destructive.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">On the other hand, El Niño is having an
impact. There are already climate changes and not only that but also deforestation. This
is the price that mankind is beginning to pay for its assault on nature as well as the
reason for the growing emphasis on environmental issues and the need to attach ever
greater importance to this problem.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There had never been a drought in Cuba like
the one preceding hurricane George. It is true that it did not strike the whole island the
same way but in large areas of Holguin, Las Tunas and part of Guantanamo, it was extremely
severe. The drought disturbed some areas more than others but the island in general had
never suffered a drought like this before. In some areas there was absolutely no rain all
spring.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">On the other hand, hurricanes like these
are more frequent now. El Niño is producing major floods in some places and major
droughts in others. For these countries it was a catastrophe. It is said that this will
cause a 50 years relapse.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There has been a high number of victims.
The figures vary and no one will ever know the exact number because there are the dead and
the missing people. The bodies of many victims of hurricane Flora that hit Cuba in 1963
were never found. Nobody should think that after such a flood the bodies start to show
when the rain stops. Actually, many bodies are washed away by the current never to be
found.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In Central America, between 10,000 and
12,000 bodies have been recovered, different figures have been reported. The initial
reports were about 30,000 people either dead or missing. As a rule, 95% of the missing
people turn out dead. Hundreds and perhaps thousands of people are still buried under the
mountain mud. I know that in Nicaragua several thousand people lived in five villages at
the foot of a volcano --I read these data-- and only 180 had been found; the others remain
buried there and are counted as missing.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We considered it our primary duty to
effectively support Central America according to some considerations made after the
passage of hurricane George in view of the ravages sustained by Haiti and the Dominican
Republic. We sent a medical brigade to the Dominican Republic as soon as there was a
landing strip available in the capital. I hear that one of the doctors in the brigade
spoke here this afternoon.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I keep fresh in my mind many interesting
and moving stories about what they did in Barahona. There were two towns there: one on the
left bank of a river, the other on the right. The one on the right was much more seriously
affected, the mud reaching almost to the house rooftops. In the town on the left, there
was not as much mud, as it is on higher grounds. Two different municipalities, with an old
hospital in the one on the left and a new one in the one on the right, recently completed
but buried under the mud. They cleaned the mud off the equipment. Can you image anesthesia
equipment, respirators and others covered by the mud?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Only a few pieces of equipment could not be
recovered, that is, they were beyond repair but most were recovered. Hardly 48 hours later
the equipment rescued from the mud was being used in surgeries. They performed over 100
deliveries and operations, notwithstanding the thousands of people who came to see them
from up to 50 kilometers away. The authorities had to step in with armed personnel and
forces to preserve order. People began lining up at 3:00 a.m. to see a doctor.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It had a great impact. The government was
very appreciative, all the authorities and organizations were grateful for the work done
by these 13 health-care workers; that is what we should call them because among those 13
people was the electric generator technician and a few nurses. It was all very moving
because there was nothing they would not do to honor these workers and express their
appreciation for what they did and the example they set, for the way they had restlessly
labored. They were taken to other places later. The Dominican authorities are very
interested in our experience. What happened in the Dominican Republic gave us valuable
ideas about possible forms of cooperation in this field.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Before that, when the same devastating
hurricane passed over Haiti, we were wondering what would happen to that country. It was
then, on September 28, that we advanced the idea of a comprehensive health-care program
for Haiti. Between 200 and 250 people were reported dead and a number of people missing.
They did not know the exact figure but it could be estimated in 500 altogether. Well, it
hurt badly to hear about those 500 victims and we thought about the poverty in Haiti where
many houses are made of palm-tree leaves and other fragile materials. Fortunately, the
mountain range between Haiti and the Dominican Republic acted as a windbreak. There are
mountains over 3000 meters high which worked as a windbreak, so the damage was not caused
so much by the strong winds as by the rains that flowed down the mountains. That was what
happened in Haiti.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We thought about this because there has
been so much talk about Haiti for so long but nothing has ever been resolved. Despite the
fact that we were also affected, we felt that the international community should give a
priority to those countries. But, we still wondered, what could we do for Haiti? The
experience accumulated over these 40 years of Revolution has taught us how an effective
health-care program can be developed, how much it costs and what is essential for such a
program.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At the triumph of the Revolution the infant
mortality rate here was, in the first year of life, 60 per 1000 live-births and it is 7.2
now. What was the death rate for children from 0 to four or five years old per 1000
live-births? It could not have been less than 75, and it is 9.3 today.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When the hurricane battered Haiti, we
proposed a health-care program based on the following idea: there are 135 deaths between
the ages of 0 and 4 per 1000 live-births in Haiti every year. That is what the statistics
report, but let us say between the ages of 0 and 5, since the statistics for Central
America are always given for the ages of 0 to 5. Based on the experience accumulated by
our country, the possibility of reducing that figure from 135 to 35 is not only feasible
but easily attainable, I would say, if the adequate personnel and necessary medicines are
provided.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It was then that we announced that if one
or several developed countries --we mentioned some-- would contribute the medicines, we
would be willing to provide the doctors needed. The matter remained pending.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In fact, there were not even communications
with Haiti at the time but as a result of that proposal Rene Preval, President of Haiti,
visited Cuba a short time ago accompanied by his minister of health and other ministers.
He arrived in our country right after the disaster that impacted on Central America which
created new moral obligations for us but by then we already had the essential ideas worked
out. We thought about what could be done. The news from Central America were not about 250
deaths and a similar number of missing people; Central America was reporting 30,000
victims.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We know that the potential number of lives
to save per million inhabitants in Central America is lower than in Haiti where an infant
mortality rate of 135 per 1000 live-births, from 0 to 5 years of age, creates an enormous
potential for life saving. On that occasion we discussed the possibility of saving about
25,000 lives in Haiti, 15,000 of them children -- a conservative estimate because there
really would be more but it is always better to make conservative estimates-- and some
10,000 adults, again a conservative estimate.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Actually, with a program like I have
described, between 20 and 22 thousand children could be saved in Haiti. Every year,
between 200 and 220 thousand children are born in Haiti whose population is 7.5 million.
Two fundamental figures should be kept in mind: the total number of births and those who
die in the above-mentioned age groups.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We immediately analyzed all those figures
on Central America to determine the potential to save lives. Something else was involved
here that did not apply in the case of Haiti: the situation in these countries with large
areas flooded, including the capital of Honduras and a huge number of victims was reported
by television networks throughout the world. CNN and every other TV network were shooting
film footage of the catastrophe and broadcasting it to the world. The images and reports
of what happened in Central America shocked the world. The world did not see these images
of Haiti or the Dominican Republic.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At the same time, everyone is aware that
Central America is the poorest region in the continent, although there are other poor
countries in Latin America: Bolivia is a poor country, and so is Paraguay, to a certain
extent. The mortality rates in these countries are still rather high.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We then thought it best to work with a
figure that would eloquently exemplify what could be done for the countries so
dramatically affected. Since 30,000 victims are reported, we wanted to know if it would be
possible to save as many lives every year as had been lost to the hurricane based on the
premise that if the world was shocked by the tragedy of 30,000 people killed and the
enormous material damage caused, then it was time to do something for these long-suffering
peoples.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The need to condone debts was raised.
Nicaragua&#146;s debt was about six billion dollars. Among others, it had an outstanding
debt with Cuba, therefore, the first thing we immediately did was to condone that debt.
This action had a moral value, a symbolic value. Ours is not a rich country so, most of
their six billion dollars debt they have with international institutions and wealthy
developed countries with lots of money and resources. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The request to write off their debts was
officially put forward by the Central American countries themselves. At an emergency
meeting held in El Salvador, they advanced seven points which you know about through the
press and television coverage. They requested a moratorium on the expulsion of the
so-called Central American aliens from the United States; condoning the debts to the two
most seriously affected countries, that is, Honduras and Nicaragua; and a regional
development program, among other requests. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All the calculations made, we realized that
even if the number of deaths were 30,000 --assuming the number was 30,000 although I hope
that when more precise calculations are made the number will drop to 25,000 or lower--
that it would be possible to undertake a comprehensive health program to save as many
lives every year as were lost in the hurricane.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The argument we put forward to the
international community was this: it is very important that international financial
institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank, and countries like France, Spain, Austria and others in the European
Union, the United States, Canada, and institutions like the European Parliament and many
others are shocked and beginning to talk about writing off or cutting down debts that
total 10 billion dollars; that is very good, really important. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I think that if this battle continues, the
debts will eventually be condoned; many have already begun proposing to condone these
debts. They could write off 80% or even 100% of Nicaragua's and Honduras' debts. They also
could, and should, relieve the debts of the other countries affected. A large part of
these countries' annual budgets is used to pay the interest on these debts or to amortize
them.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Nicaragua's outstanding debt with Cuba was
not building up interest because we had canceled the interest. Initially it was larger but
we had made reductions and cancellations. Some amounts had been repaid but we had called
off the interest on that debt. At one point, it had reached 90 million dollars but by now
it was reduced to 50.1 million, without the interest.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">These countries sometimes must spend 30% or
40% of their annual budgets on servicing their foreign debts and so they are left with
practically nothing for social spending, very little for education and health-care,
therefore, having these debts condoned would bring a major relief to them although it
would still be far from enough. Let the debts be condoned but still the countries need to
be rebuilt and that requires billions of dollars; the countries need to develop and that
requires billions more.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As for the requests put forth by the
Central American governments, we immediately supported the seven points, just hours after
the agreement was published. We supported it immediately! The first two countries to
cancel their foreign debts were Cuba and France. The decision had been made here in the
early morning hours of the day it was announced but due to some details and calculations,
some precision or other that we needed to have, it was announced in the afternoon. But the
decision had been made 14 hours earlier. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">France is in a different time zone. When we
were meeting during the small hours of morning, it was already daytime there. At that same
meeting, we drafted the note that would be published; later in the morning it had to be
typed, figures had to be checked, it had to be translated into different languages and the
Foreign Ministry also had to attend to an important visitor that morning, so we decided to
make the decision public in the afternoon. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are not rivaling the French on this.
Chronologically, they announced before Cuba the canceling of Nicaragua&#146;s 70 million
dollars debt. We could not condone any other debt with Central America because there were
not any. We did not condone debts with Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador because there
were no debts. Nicaragua&#146;s was the only debt we could cancel because it was the only
country that had one with us.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are not competing with the French, I am
simply explaining a historical fact. The decision had been made at the time I said, upon
receiving news of the agreements adopted at the meeting in El Salvador. We take pleasure
in conceding to the French the honor of being the first because it was more significant
that France did it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Unquestionably, Cuba&#146;s gesture is of
great moral value since we are a Third World country, undergoing a special situation,
blockaded and subjected to an economic war. What France did is particularly significant
because it is a European country with lots of resources and a major influence in the
European Union. We attach great importance to France&#146;s decision and we are very
pleased that, along with France, Cuba was one of the first two countries to condone a
foreign debt. Later, other countries did likewise. I think Austria was the third country
to announce.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Spanish did not talk about canceling
the debt, however, they offered a great deal of aid and suspended the servicing of the
debt for a period of time. The Spanish are really taking substantially major steps in
providing aid to Central America. I also think that at least 80% of Honduras' and
Nicaragua's foreign debts might eventually be condoned.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Presently, large amounts of funds are
needed for two things: rebuilding and development. Mankind cannot go on accepting the
drama and terrible poverty in which so many people live. A world where we hear talk of so
many millions and trillions, where there is so much waste, it is no longer acceptable that
when faced with tragedies like this we limit ourselves to providing first aid, some help
for reconstruction and nothing else, end of story.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our proposal for Haiti had already been
conceived. As you know, on September 28 we raised two fundamental ideas: that Haiti did
not need a soldiers&#146; invasion but rather a physicians&#146; invasion, an invasion of
teachers ---who would have to speak either French or Creole-- and an invasion of many
million dollars for the country's development because what is happening there is a source
of shame for this hemisphere, for all the West and for the world today. Haiti was the
first nation in the Caribbean and Latin America to attain independence almost 200 years
ago through the triumphant slave revolt that defeated the most powerful army in Europe at
the time, Napoleon Bonaparte&#146;s; the first social revolution on the continent, while
in the United States, slavery continued for almost a century after the famous declaration
that considered it a self-evident truth that all men were born &quot;free and equal.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We stated that it is time to end the policy
of invasions, interventions and similar strategies that have historically been used
against Haiti. Everyone knows the cause of poverty in that country. There was not a single
school that taught reading and writing to those slaves who, on the other hand, were
capable of wining their independence. It is time for Mankind, that talks so much about
globalization and humanism, to solve these problems and provide definitive solutions for
cases like Haiti&#146;s. There is more than enough money for that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When one tragedy followed another --Central
America&#146;s immediately after the Dominican Republic and Haiti&#146;s-- we said it was
time for the problems of Central America, the poorest area in the hemisphere, home to the
poorest countries in the region except for Haiti, to be solved once and for all instead of
simply making much noise and visits and tours and then forget about it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We looked at the seven points set forth by
the Central American governments, the essential matters put forward by them. First, we
fully supported the seven points, and then we added our willingness to send, for the time
required, all the doctors needed to back up the program for reconstruction, economic and
social development in the countries affected.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">First, we made some calculations. Infant
mortality between the ages of 0 and 5 years in each of these countries, according to
United Nations figures is as follows: Guatemala, 63 per 1000 live births --I read in one
of the front page articles of <b>Granma</b> today the figure of 58, and the difference is
not great but we worked with the figure of 63, I do not know if there is a more recent
figure-- Nicaragua, 57; Honduras, 48; El Salvador, 47. These are the figures we worked
with. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Last night we were discussing whether 48
applied to El Salvador and 47 to Honduras, based on two different sources. Anyway, the
minimum average infant mortality rate for this age group in the four countries affected by
the hurricane is 54. We also calculated the number of births, which is around 900,000 a
year, based on an approximate average birth rate of 3.4%. By rigorously comparing the
figures with the most recent information available and analyzing it country by country,
you can obtain almost exact figures that would barely differ from those we used.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We calculated what would be needed and the
possibility to undertake a comprehensive program for reducing infant mortality which might
be brought down to 20 if the program were properly implemented. Based on our own
experience, we know how this goal can be achieved and even what the cost might be.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">While in Haiti we proposed reducing it to
35, we believed that the conditions existed in Central America to reduce it to 20. That is
more than twice the rate in Cuba now and ours is a blockaded country, subjected to an
economic war and enduring great needs, where there has even been a major reduction of
calories and proteins intake since the beginning of the <i>special period</i>.
Nevertheless, infant mortality has continued to decrease to 9.3 between the ages of 0 to 5
and only 7.2 in the first year of life.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Therefore, what we are advancing for
Central America is still more than twice the infant mortality rate in Cuba today --and
there are new techniques, new medicines and new vaccines that would make this task
easier-- and 50% higher than the rate in Costa Rica. There, we have the example of a
Central American country [Costa Rica] that worked at developing health-care programs over
the course of many years, even before the triumph of the Cuban Revolution. They have
worked hard and with international support they have reduced the rate to 14 between the
ages of 0 to 5 per 1000 live-births a year, according to United Nations figures. That is
to say, if a country in Central America has a rate of 14, it is perfectly possible to
reduce the index to an average of 20 in the other countries of the region. Today, that
goal could be reached in a very short period of time.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Moreover, if it were not reduced to 20 but
to 25, it would still be possible to save 25,000 children between the ages of 0 to 5 in
Central America, 25,000 children a year. To tell the truth, with the program we are
advancing, 30,000 could be saved. If you add the rest of the population over five years of
age, a very conservative calculation would tell you that 20,000 lives might be saved in
Central America.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But it is not just a matter of the lives
that could be saved. After talking with the doctors who have been to the Dominican
Republic --and I spent five hours talking with them the day after they got back, listening
to all the details of their experiences during the 40 days they were there-- we realized
that extending the services to the whole population could prevent many people from being
disable. Many do not die but can lose, for example, their sight, hearing or normal
movement capacity and be left disabled or partially disabled, walking with a limp, or
unable to use a hand or an arm. Some are left disabled and others suffer dozens of years
from curable diseases.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A comprehensive health program cannot be
measured only by the number of lives saved but rather for the millions of people who begin
to feel safer, and that comes first in health care. That sense of security is offered to
millions of parents, aunts and uncles, grandparents, children, because a child has a
parent of a certain age who might suffer from one thing or another, or might die from a
preventable or curable disease.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You also need to consider how such a
program would raise life expectancy and bring from eight to ten additional years of life
to many million people. Also, that life would not only be longer and safer but also more
humane because a countless number of people would be spared from disabilities and
suffering. I do not want to mention specific cases because some are terrible.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are many minor disabilities involving
arms or legs that could be remedied and backbone deformities that treated in time can
spare a human being 30 or 40 years of suffering. I have given you only three or four
examples but 50 could be given. For a comprehensive health program we tend to use a very
illustrative figure and that is the number of lives that can be saved. It is still clearer
if the lives saved are associated with those that were lost in a natural disaster which
shocked the world because the world saw corpses floating in the water or buried in the
mud, as described in the Cuban statement. This had an impact on billions of people.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, the thousands dying silently whose
names are not printed by any newspaper, whose corpses are not captured in any picture or
television shot, who are known only to the parents who bury them --I am talking about
children in this case-- like those who filled the south coast of the Sierra Maestra with
crosses because no boats happened to pass by to take them to a doctor in Santiago de Cuba.
Now, these cannot continue to be forgotten.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Human loss is always the most shocking
although material losses should also move us because those crops provide for all those
human beings. But the biggest impact comes from knowing that there are thousands of people
buried in a mountainside and others whose bodies were swept out to sea, others who are
still buried in mud or at the bottom of a river or a lake and who now constitute a serious
problem because this is a source of all kinds of diseases, and there is no clean drinking
water.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In Honduras there was no clean drinking
water anywhere. A few days ago I read the story of a girl who was killed for a pitcher of
drinking water she was carrying on top of her head; because all the water is contaminated,
all of it. The aqueducts are not operational and the rivers are full of corpses, from both
people and animals. There is no water to drink.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, the material damage must be
repaired. What I am telling you about the water is not something you can see, someone has
to talk about it. On appealing to the international community we said: a hurricane worse
than Mitch is causing terrible human damage, it is a hurricane that kills more people
every year than this one, some of its victims you saw on television and were moved by
them. Twenty years can pass without a Mitch and a million people will silently die in
Central America without anyone taking notice. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Shall we have to wait for still worse
hurricanes, given the climatic changes and the ever more frequent El Niño phenomenon?
Shall we have to wait for more hurricanes, earthquakes and other disasters, or droughts
that cause considerable damage although they do not kill people directly like a hurricane?
When are we going to pay attention? In substance, this is what we are putting forward.
They are basically ideas relevant not only for Central America but also for the rest of
the world. This is the message that must be spread throughout the world, this global
world, with so much technology, so much waste and so much inequality in the distribution
of wealth.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But there is more: these health care goals
we are fostering for Central America can be achieved without a change in the social
system. It would not make any sense to say that this could only be achieved by first
carrying out a political and social revolution, in other words, a revolution like in Cuba.
It would not be necessary and no one would have the right to wait for such changes to save
hundreds of thousands of lives that can be saved with a bit of rationality and common
sense. It is possible to do it with this same social system, the existing ownership
system, even with a modest support from the international community. That is because this
task is relatively easy, it is both, possible and easy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A task that is possible and easy no
government in any country would turn down, no government! On the contrary, what we have
perceived through the delegation that visited Honduras and Guatemala is a great interest
on the part of both governments in implementing such a plan and a great enthusiasm over
the possibility of doing it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It must be done. Of course, it is essential
to know how to do it. What do I mean by this? That it must be done very tactfully. First
of all, it is important that nobody feels wronged by this, that no doctor feels wronged or
in any way affected by such a program. This program does not intend to take the place of a
single doctor in any country of Central America. On the contrary, we can modestly
cooperate with them in those health matters where our experience may be useful.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is leptospirosis, for example. We
have developed a vaccine against it and a million people in our country have been
vaccinated because it has proven to be effective. It is a new vaccine produced here. We
are not exporting it yet, we have applied for registration, but it is being widely used
already. I have been told that close to a million people have been vaccinated in our
country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In addition, we have developed a very
effective biological product, a lethal enemy of rats, which sells at 8,000 US dollars a
ton; it is called BIORAT. We have already sent some to the region. First, Nicaragua
requested five tons and we immediately sent them by plane. Then they requested 15 more
tons, and we sent them. We produce it here and there are costs involved, but production is
growing considerably.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We sent the BIORAT, and we have the
vaccine. One of the most seriously affected countries has solicited 40,000 doses of the
vaccine. When they learned about the vaccine, and that we were using it, they asked us for
40,000 doses. They made the request yesterday, or the day before yesterday, and tomorrow
or the day after they will be using it to help contain the leptospirosis epidemic.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, I have been sharing with you some of
the principles supporting the comprehensive health-care program we are advancing as a
model for cooperation programs in the poorest Third World countries. Take notice that this
proposal originates in Cuba, a country that is far from wealthy, a blockaded country
enduring a <i>special period</i>. If we can do this, a world with a gross product that is
about 30 trillion dollars can also do it. The United States alone is producing about eight
trillion and Japan four trillion, to cite two examples. Europe must be producing about the
same as the United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We would have to work out the numbers, of
course, but I would dare say that the industrial nations with one-sixth of the world's
population account for over 80% of the gross product. They have so many resources that I
believe a program like this --and I have not finished explaining the details which I want
to do today-- could be implemented with a minimum effort.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They are constantly joining forces, entire
armies join forces to wage wars, invade countries, intervene here and there. Based on
their concept of civilization, enriched with certain hegemonic interests for world
domination plus the need to preserve order --their order-- they try to prevent local or
internal wars where unfortunately 1000, 10,000, or even tens of thousands are killed with
weapons supplied by the large producers, who are all too well-known, thus providing the
ideal pretext to the most wealthy and powerful for waging their &quot;humanitarian
wars.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have been making the estimates of what a
health program in Central America would require and the enormous benefits it would bring.
If applied to the rest of Latin America, Africa and the countries of Asia you can imagine
how much good it would bring humanity. You can work out the costs yourselves and see that
it would be ridiculously low. Ten different arguments can be used to demonstrate how
ridiculously little it would cost to apply such a program that could save the lives of
tens of millions people every year, as many people as those who died in World War I.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The war against underdevelopment, poverty,
hunger and disease would be the only truly humanitarian war.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Cuba wants to prove that if a country with
such limited material and economic resources can do something like this in our region, the
industrial world can do infinitely more. I am not saying that we are poor in human
resources because in that sense we are really wealthy, like Olympic champions, and I am
not simply boasting or being vain about it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I wonder, really, if the United States
could send 2000 physicians to work in the conditions our doctors are willing to in
solidarity with Central America. We are not contemplating that they go to the capital
cities, to the big cities, to live in hotels or residences; they will be living in tents,
or huts, or wherever they need to live, as was the case during the literacy campaign in
our country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The 100,000 students who volunteered to end
illiteracy in Cuba, where did they stay? And these were young people 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
years old, 100,000 of them! They stayed in the farmers&#146; hovels, anywhere they could.
That is part of many of our best doctors&#146; background. Many of these doctors took part
in the literacy campaign thus educating their hard-working spirit, their fraternal
sentiments. They began the tradition. That is why, when it comes to resources, I say we
are wealthy in human resources. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Shall we be able to send 2000 doctors? In
August, 2500 more will graduate. In South Africa, there are 402 of our doctors working in
the remotest townships. They have even learned the language of the townships. They had
studied English but they have learned the languages of the townships where English is not
spoken.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We were really pleased when a minister from
a very important country in this hemisphere, the Health Minister of Canada who recently
visited our country and talked about these issues, told me at the end of our conversation
that he had met with the South African Health Minister a short while ago and the South
African minister had widely praised the work of the Cuban doctors in the South African
townships. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This was a timely comment that we received
at the exact moment when we needed to have such news, and no less than from this major,
outstanding political personality: the Health Minister of Canada. I had discussed with him
some of these issues, these countries&#146; needs and the possibility of doing much with
very little. I was trying to persuade him and he was actually very receptive to our views.
At the end, he told me he was very highly impressed by what the South African Health
Minister had told him.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thus, our doctors working in South Africa
have become an example. They are contributing with their work to the effort of building an
awareness about what can, and should, be done. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There were times when 6000 students
enrolled at the medical school in a single year. Today, 3000 to 4000 new doctors graduate
every year. By August, we will have 66,000 doctors. Of course, from that figure we should
deduct the 400 who are presently in South Africa and other places, a 1000 doctors
deduction.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have offered Haiti 200 doctors. Well,
that was a working figure but we have not set any limits. We have been discussing the
issue and four Cuban health-care experts have gone to study the situation <i>in situ</i>.
They have clinics there --donated by foreign institutions or countries-- fully equipped
and modern but with no personnel.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The work we are discussing now is really
direct, like a community doctor&#146;s. But then, of course, cases immediately start to
appear that require surgery and these people have to be hospitalized. All this will have
to be studied. We also plan to continue lobbying the international community so that there
are not only doctors in remote places where they are needed but also certain networks of
primary care clinics with a few beds and facilities for surgery.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As for now, our doctors will have to work
there without laboratories, determining whether it is a parasite, amoeba or something
else, causing the problem, make a diagnosis based on the symptoms and decide on the
medication. Our community doctors know quite a lot about this because they have worked in
the countryside. Our specialists in general integral medicine have a three years minimum
of community work experience.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The medical teams have been formed. A major
effort should be done now to study the situation, not at some unknown point in the future
but immediately. The four experts will be returning from Haiti today or tomorrow. They met
with the President and they also bring ideas resulting from their fact-finding mission.
They have said that conditions in some areas are truly rough. The population is large and
there is a lot of eroded and deforested land.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">No time has been lost. Four experts left
for Haiti with the President and we have been making arrangements here, working and
soliciting support for the program in Haiti. It is not for us that we are asking, it is
for others and that is always easier than asking for oneself. If, in addition, you are
contributing an essential element like the people needed there, people ready and willing
to go to any mountain, any valley or rural area, that gives you a certain authority, a
certain moral stance for making proposals.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This is how two hurricanes brought two
programs together. Both programs are feasible and require few resources. We will provide
the human resources. We will send as many people as required and replace them when
necessary. There are 21 medical schools in this country, they are located in every
province. At the moment, two ideas born from two hurricanes are underway and we can
calculate the figures mathematically. The number of lives that can be saved in 10 years
and in 20 years with the two programs. Someone once said --I think it is a line from a
tango-- that 20 years are nothing. Well, I assure you that over a million lives might be
saved in 20 years.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The annual figures are very illustrative.
In Haiti, 25,000 lives can be saved. That means 50 times more lives than were lost in the
hurricane, assuming 500 were lost, that is, dead and missing people. But, because the
victims and the destruction in Central America were so dramatic and so deeply shocking to
the world, this has led us to consider the saving as many lives --and there were a great
many-- as were lost in the hurricane.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At the same time, we continue promoting
internationally the other two ideas: reconstruction and economic and social development
programs. When I speak of social development I am also thinking of education, housing,
employment and other needs. I am talking of an extremely important aspect of social
development, that is, human health. We can make a considerable contribution, both in Haiti
and in Central America.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What can we offer? Let us put it in figures
because if you say, for example, all the doctors needed, no one knows how many are but
when you say 2000 doctors for Central America, that is clearer and more concrete. Being
conservatives, and to avoid an overstatement, we said 2000 which is a remarkable number
and has made an impact in the world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our announcement received the least
publicity with our neighbors in the north. I do not know how many people in the United
States are aware that Cuba has proposed such a program and is willing to immediately send
the doctors it has offered. Of course, we will have to wait a short time before sending
them all because we need to study where they will go and draw up the program in detail,
but our willingness to send 2000 doctors immediately has been expressed. We will have to
feed the full text of our statements to Internet --since they have more computers than
anyone else in the world-- for the people in the United States to know about the first and
second statements. They have already been translated, well translated.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Cuban Government Statement read by
Robertico [Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina] at the United Nations, was distributed to all
delegations there as soon as he finished reading it. The 180 delegations received it
translated into English and French, as well as the original Spanish; there was not enough
time to translate it into other languages. Then, as soon as it was confirmed that he had
finished it was released. We did not want to take any chances in case Robertico might get
sick, or anything that might come up, and then we would have published a statement that
had not been made, or publish it before he had read it out because of a delay. Anyway, as
soon as it was confirmed, the head of the Cuban Mission was notified. The statement had
already been printed and the copies sent to all the diplomatic missions in the countries
with which we have relations, as well as at the Cuban Interest Section in Washington, from
where it could be sent to many people in the United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is no doubt that we will have to feed
them to Internet and recommend... (HE IS TOLD THAT THE DECLARATIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN FED
TO INTERNET). Both of them? Remember the first one, supporting the Central American
governments&#146; proposal after the meeting in El Salvador.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are three important documents: first,
the message to the Nicaraguan people; second, the statement announcing the cancellation of
Nicaragua's foreign debt, the support for the points adopted at the meeting in El
Salvador, and the medical offer; and third, very concretely, the Cuban Government
Statement that Robertico read at the press conference in the capital of Honduras,
Tegucigalpa. Rosa Elena [Simeon, Minister of Science, Technology and the Environment],
make sure that the three are on the Internet, well translated.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We must reach the American people with
them, it is important. I do not know why and I do not want to blame anyone for this
--perhaps there are other important news or issues-- but we have asked the Foreign
Ministry and the head of our Interest Section in Washington whether it has been published
in the United States and they have said no. It has been published in Europe and in many
other countries, but not there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This blockaded country enduring a <i>special
period</i> is willing to send a minimum of 2000 doctors immediately. Would it not be great
if the United States tried to compete with us in this area! They are helping, we must say
they are helping; their military helicopters have rescued people in isolated, endangered
areas and they have carried food and medicine to places where they could not be delivered
any other way. They are not sending doctors, they are sending soldiers. Of course, they
are not there to kill people. They have done it before but not this time. Now it seems
that these soldiers have been given a really constructive, positive and useful mission.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In fact, they lack the civilian
organization needed for this. The army is perhaps the only institution with all the means
and the organization required to build highways and bridges at full speed in any emergency
situation. They plan to send 4000 soldiers to work basically in the infrastructure and
help with other important works; it must be recognized that these are important tasks.
They have said that they will provide some medical services, I do not know what they will
be like. They must have very good doctors in the army, I can imagine they are experts,
mainly in war medicine.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thinking about what I was told by the
doctors who went with the brigade to the Dominican Republic, like the story of an
excellent obstetrician who assisted in a complicated delivery performed under the
difficult conditions of a makeshift hospital and who saved the lives of both the baby and
the mother, I cannot imagine a member of the U.S. army medical corps, in a Central
American village, assisting with a breech birth, in the conditions our doctor was working,
or providing care in English, or working without a laboratory or an X-ray equipment,
treating a child suffering from any of the various diseases so common in a tropical Third
World country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Anyway, this I want to say: they are
helping in Central America with reconstruction work but they have to do it with soldiers
who are part of an organized and disciplined institution with all the engineering
equipment, transportation, material resources and money needed to do it at the necessary
speed. Other countries have also sent soldiers and we are happy that they are providing
these services to the countries of Central America.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is exactly what we are preaching, that
those countries need help. Thus, it would be good if the American people could know how
much can be done with very few resources in other fields essential to the well-being of
Central American peoples. I hope the U.S. press will also publicize what others are doing.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I will tell you the truth: we are giving
some publicity to our cooperation but not to boost Cuba's prestige because we do not go
around publicizing and exalting what we do. How many Cuban doctors have rendered their
services in the Third World? Twenty-six thousand doctors. I said it in South Africa but
here we never talk about that. The countless services this country has provided to other
peoples and to many individuals from other countries have received a minimum of publicity
or no publicity at all.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In this case we are publicizing it, first
because it is necessary to build an awareness in the international community and the
wealthy countries about issues and problems crucial to the world; second, because an
effort of the nature and magnitude we are proposing must be explained to our country, what
it consists of and how we are going to carry it out. We need all the support of our
doctors, nurses and health technicians. We need the support of all the people. We need our
people to enthusiastically and proudly understand and cooperate as they have always done
with such noble and worthy efforts. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now we are asking for 2000 voluntary
doctors. We know that many are coming forward and applying to participate. Everywhere in
Cuba, in every province and municipality doctors, nurses and health technicians are
applying to take part. If they do not receive all the necessary information they cannot be
properly mobilized. Medical personnel also have families, patients, obligations, plans for
further studies. Nonetheless, I have no doubt of their response.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was talking with Juventino, the doctor
who spoke about natural medicine and I told him: Juventino, we may need your help in the
Central American program. He was talking to me very enthusiastically about natural
medicine, saying that it was the medicine of choice for poor countries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I used the figure of 2000 volunteers. I
know they can be mobilized with practically no publicity but this is a great effort, one
that demands great sacrifices. We are asking for a little more than that: we are asking
for 2200, because we need 200 for Haiti, and still more, all the available volunteers
because if 500 more are needed in Central America we must send them; and if 200 or 400
more are needed in Haiti we must send them.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is why we are giving the people vast
information. If it were not for that reason you can be sure that we would not be saying a
single word about this or that medical brigade, we would do it discreetly and quietly as
on many other previous occasions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our honorable tradition of providing
medical assistance to other peoples in the world is not new. I recall when the first
brigade arrived in Algeria in 1962 or 1963, when that country had just gained its
independence. It was then that the history of our doctors' missions abroad began. I recall
the medical assistance sent to Nicaragua when the earthquake destroyed the city and our
planes took in medications. I recall the medical brigade sent to Guatemala, a long time
ago, because on these matters we do not mind ideological issues or political differences,
not at all. It is a matter of solidarity, of our duty to other peoples, our duty to
humanity and we simply do it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At the time of the earthquake in Peru, we
did not have diplomatic relations with any South American country. There were 70,000
deaths due to that earthquake. In 10 days, our people made 10,000 blood donations to the
Peruvian people and Cuba not only sent medical brigades but also construction brigades to
build hospitals in the most damaged areas.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is an honorable and glorious tradition
in our country which in a spirit of solidarity has never excluded any country for no
reason whatsoever. It is not a new idea. No one can think that we want to use the Central
American countries' tragedy to improve our image or win political advantages. It is a
great tradition. Even when very hostile men ruled in those countries and there were
absolutely no relations we sent medical aid every time there was a catastrophe. Today, our
capacity in this field is incomparably greater.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is something else. When there was a
major earthquake in California we sent a message to the governor of that state expressing
our willingness to send at least a few doctors or do anything within our power, even if
symbolic, as an expression of our wishes to help; and that was California, a very rich
state of the United States of America, the country blockading us.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Since we have relations with some black
friends and legislators, and we know that there are neighborhoods in the United States
that lack adequate medical services, on occasions we have said that the day they need
Cuban doctors in one of those neighborhoods, they can have them. Of course, our doctors
would never be allowed into that country, that is certain, but we have been willing to
send them to the United States free of charge. It is a tradition with us and this would be
much in line with that tradition, but still more in line with today's world and with
Cuba&#146;s statements with regard to the present world situation, with our preaching.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">To these elements I will only add something
else which I feel is very important: the cost. How much would it cost to save perhaps
30,000 lives? We have told you the estimates and that this program would intend to save
50,000 lives. However, we have not talked about 50,000 in Central America. We have talked
about saving the same number of lives that the hurricane took, assuming there were 30,000
deaths. We have talked about 30,000 and we have talked about no less than 25,000 children
among those 30,000. I am basically talking here on behalf of the 25,000 children who can
be saved each year.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How much could that cost? There is one
thing about medications. Medicines are usually very expensive if you buy the finished
product from commercial companies, and one product can come under 15 or 20 different brand
names. We produce ourselves many of our medicines and vaccines. We also import the raw
material to produce 90% of our medications here. We only import 10% that we cannot
produce.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are even working on cancer and AIDS
vaccines. The hepatitis B vaccine, the first one produced in the world and the only one in
the world today obtained through genetic engineering is a Cuban vaccine. Interferon and
many other drugs are produced in our country. We often lack medicines. We have shortages
for different reasons which are sometimes administrative or due to some people&#146;s
hoarding; there are also those who steal medicines. Those things are known and we are
tenaciously working to establish controls over all that. Quite often, though, the
shortages are due to delayed arrivals of raw materials from distant places.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Just think that in better times, although
there were some drugs we bought from the socialist countries, we spent approximately from
100 to 110 million US dollars --and look that we are talking hard currency-- on a
population that was then over 10 million people fully covering medical services, mostly by
producing medications here at considerably lower costs.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have been recommending to representatives
of countries from whom we have been asking cooperation for the health programs in Haiti
and Central America that, if they decided to participate, considering the profoundly
humanitarian nature of the programs, they could ask the laboratories in their countries to
cut down prices or set them at cost plus a moderate profit.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We know what can be done in our country
with a million dollars in raw materials for medicines. The cost of medicines for the
comprehensive health program in Central America to save the lives of no less than 25,000
children and 5000 adults --in other words, no less than 30,000 lives-- must be very
carefully studied but possibly the need for medications and vitamins could be covered with
no more than 200 million dollars. It could be a little more or a little less, depending on
the way they are purchased or produced with the assistance of the World Health
Organization and the Pan-American Health Organization, which have experience and sometimes
obtain very low prices. That is, 200 million dollars, and this is an approximate
mathematical calculation, it could be a little more or a little less; it could even be
lower depending on various circumstances and possibilities.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What does 200 million dollars amount to? I
am thinking about the United States' war budget, 260 billion dollars, plus other programs
for the development of ever more deadly, sophisticated and expensive weapons, when the
cold war is supposed to be over. One dollar out of every 1250 dollars spent in military
activities --if used in a rational and cooperative health plan like we are suggesting for
Central America-- could save 50,000 lives and 100 dollars out of every 1250 could save 5
million lives.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How much is a human life worth? What is the
sense of the world spending 800 billion dollars in military budgets every year? What could
it not be achieved in health care, education, drinking water, housing, irrigation systems,
food production, scientific research and environmental protection with half of that money?
Where is the rationality and what hope is there for humanity with the world order imposed?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Everyday currency speculation activities
involve one trillion dollars. If those operations were taxed at the rate of 1%, enough
money would be collected for the Third World's economic and social development and to save
millions of people dying every year of curable diseases. A Nobel laureate in Economics
raised this 1% tax idea very seriously a few years ago when this new and colossal
phenomenon was just beginning, and it would be easy to do it with the computers available.
There is already the example of countries such as Brazil, which charges a 1% tax on every
check issued.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As for the comprehensive development plan,
I dare say that it would be possible to carry out this health care plan in Central America
which has been the focal point in my words. I dare say that, among so many huge amounts of
misspent and mismanaged money in senseless and dishonorable speculative operations, an
annual investment of 200 million dollars in a noble and humanitarian way would be about
enough. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Cuba provides the medical personnel to
work, first of all, in the most remote and difficult places where no one else would go
and, secondly, in clinics which can become a supportive network where specialists are
needed; even in a national hospital if there is a shortage of personnel in a given
specialty. They would not take the place of a single local doctor in those countries. On
the contrary, they would work with them, transferring any experience they can and asking
them for their valuable and indispensable help. It is not hard to find Central American
doctors who studied in our country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Oh! Here is another very interesting
subject. Who accompanied Robertico on the visit to the medical brigade in the Honduran
capital? The archbishop of Tegucigalpa, Monsignor Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga, who is the
very well known chairman of the Latin American Bishops' Council (CELAM) of which all the
Latin American bishops are members. We know that he is a man deeply concerned about social
problems. We are aware of the excellent speech he gave in Rome last year at the synod and
his efforts to help the poor. He was very interested in the Cuban program, so together the
Honduran and the Cuban foreign ministers and the archbishop of Tegucigalpa went to visit a
medical brigade serving a very poor community of 80,000 residents that was virtually wiped
out by the hurricane.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The next day we received another
interesting piece of news. I had asked Robertico to visit the archbishop as soon as
possible, to explain the program and ask for his cooperation. Later on, Robertico sent his
report of the visit to La Mosquitia. Let me tell you that to speak of La Mosquitia is to
speak of our Cienaga de Zapata, that swampland multiplied I do not know how many times,
and the doctors move through that area for hours in boats. The first brigade to arrive,
where was it given shelter? Part of it in the church. A very dedicated Catalonian priest
let them stay there and offered his full support. Robertico offered a very good
description of this priest in his report. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The groups working on a plan like this need
everyone's cooperation. These doctors are not involved, nor will they ever be involved, in
political issues. They will work with everyone and cooperate with everyone, first of all
with the local authorities, with the different local institutions and with the religious
organizations.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are in Central America Catholic
churches and other denominations and for this humanitarian mission we are asking for the
cooperation of all religious organizations. We are asking for cooperation from every
Catholic parish, priest or a pastor of a Christian church. They live there, they know the
families and the social problems thus their support for the health programs is
indispensable. We must conciliate and respect ideas and criteria. We should work on this
endeavor together with all the civic institutions of any social, ideological and political
stance. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Cooperation with everyone is basic to the
success of this medical program. I am saying this here because I want to make it clear
right from the beginning: our doctors will definitely not meddle in internal politics.
They will absolutely abide by the laws, traditions and customs of the countries where they
work. The dissemination of ideologies is not their mission. They will scrupulously respect
the ideologies of peoples and patients as well as their religious beliefs, thus earning
respect for their own patriotic feelings, political ideas, philosophical or religious
beliefs which they will not preach or try to advance to others. They are going to Central
America as doctors, selflessly promoting human health, working in the most difficult
places and under the most difficult conditions to save lives, to preserve or reestablish
good health and well-being, and to exalt and increase the prestige of the noble medical
profession. Nothing else.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">These are, in substance, our ideas. There
is just one more thing: we will not limit ourselves to sending 2000, 2500 or 3000 doctors.
There is something more important. Along with the offer to send doctors we have offered to
train Central American doctors in Cuba.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our doctors have great prestige everywhere.
They study six years and then they spend three other years working and continuing to study
in the community --that is what the most recent graduates have done-- plus two, three or
four years specializing, depending on the specific requirements. Our doctors are actually
very well prepared. We can have full confidence in our doctors who become still better,
and we know it, when they are assigned an important and difficult mission. That is a
characteristic of our people.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We will take especial care in training
those future Central American doctors. We already know that the school year there ends
around this time. I think their vacations begin in December so their academic calendar is
the reverse of ours. Our university courses start in September but we can use that time
difference. I think they should come a few months before the beginning of the courses for
a general review, an evaluation and intensive preparation for entering the first year of
medical school because the first two years are quite difficult in the basic sciences. As I
said, we will take especial care in training those future Central American doctors. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have offered 500 scholarships every year
to study medicine. Some press dispatches have reported 500 every year but, in general,
they are reporting 500 scholarships: Cuba has offered 500 scholarships, they say. Well, I
want to explain the idea properly.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are offering 500 scholarships a year for
a period of 10 years. Initially we did not mention this detail but our idea is to grant
500 medical school scholarships a year for a period of 10 years to young people from
Central America who are already high school graduates. In other words, Cuba is really
offering 5000 scholarships, not 500. Five thousand! That is what Cuba is offering, 500 a
year for a period of 10 years. Five thousand scholarships altogether!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We were very pleased by the conversation
our Foreign Minister had yesterday with the President of Guatemala where the latter
expressed great interest in those scholarships and raised this idea: he wants half of
those scholarships to be granted to young indigenous students. What an excellent idea!
Over 50% of the population in that country is indigenous, and in many villages the whole
population is indigenous, so it seemed a great idea to me.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At the moment, we are concentrated on the
selection for the scholarships. That work must be done as quickly as possible.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, let me tell you that the impact of the
news of Cuba's 500 scholarships offer per year has been incredible --really incredible!--
in the two Central American countries Robaina has visited.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I should also say that yesterday and the
day before, that is, in the two days since the announcement of this program Wednesday at
2:00 in the afternoon, it has been widely reported by radio, television and the written
press throughout Central America, and the telephones in our Embassies in Nicaragua and
Guatemala, and our Interest Section in Honduras have been ringing constantly.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Last night we wanted to know and they said
that the phone calls do not stop. We asked our chargé d'affaires in Nicaragua, for
instance, how many people enrolled at the universities every year and the figure he gave
us, pending confirmation, was about 5000 students all in all. I asked how many graduate
from high school every year and he said, &quot;20,000 to 25,000.&quot; There is an
enormous youth potential in that country from which to select those who will study
medicine.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Presently, we have to discuss the selection
criteria with each country. I have already said that the President of Guatemala expressed
special interest in at least half of those selected being from the indigenous communities.
We are of the view that professionals should be train who are willing to work in the
remotest and most difficult places. The larger the number of people meeting the
requirement, the greater the possibilities to make a good selection. We must analyze the
criteria and methods of selection with the health ministers and authorities of every
country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I imagine it is the same all over Central
America. We should take advantage of the five or six months before September to provide
intensive courses in preparation for their first year of medical studies.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are looking at our capacities in basic
sciences at Giron [Medical School] and other facilities, what needs to be done to receive
them as soon as possible, starting in January, so that we will not lose several months
that could be used in their preparation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Right now the demand is such that we are
even thinking that within the 10 year program we might enroll 1000 the first year instead
of 500. At the two countries visited we have seen an enormous interest in the
scholarships, both on the part of authorities and the youth. We are making a full
evaluation and we believe we will be able to receive 1000 in the first year, and later it
can be 500, 500 and 500 every successive year.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">While they are training, their countries
can have our doctors&#146; services, and not just Cuban doctors; we do not want to be
there alone. We have proposed that this be a Latin American program with the participation
of Latin American doctors. We are even proposing that it be an Ibero-American program,
including Spain and Portugal. It could even become a Euro-Ibero-American program because I
think there are possibilities and some Western European countries might want to contribute
with such a program economically and also with skilled personnel.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thus, in 10 years there would be 5500
medical students on scholarships. We are going to wait awhile but we have already shared
with some governments in the area the idea of raising the number of scholarships this
first year because there is going to be great pressure.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have the capacity to do it and so we are
training doctors from the Caribbean. All the Caribbean countries want to train doctors. We
are also training doctors from South Africa and other countries. You can see that we
really do not make any propaganda about the cooperation we give to a number of Third World
countries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A while ago, Paraguay requested
scholarships and there are now 120 Paraguayan medical students on scholarship here. Not a
word had ever been said about that. There are others who help pay the costs of their
studies, who pay a certain fee. During the <i>special period</i> that was a formula
applied to some cases. But to our Caribbean neighbors we have offered all those
scholarships free of charge. When I say scholarships they are free of charge. Paraguay,
for example, received 120 scholarships free of charge; these young Paraguayans studying
medicine were mostly selected from outside the capital. I understand that there are also
about 80 who are paying to study medicine in our country, although most of the Paraguayans
are on scholarships.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How many paying medical students do we
have, Dotres? (DR. DOTRES, MINISTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH, RESPONDS THAT THERE ARE 500 PAYING
MEDICAL STUDENTS AND 800 STUDENTS ON SCHOLARSHIPS) Right. Those who are not on
scholarships pay 5000 US dollars a year for their stay here and their studies, that is the
cost. Those figures are far below the fees in the United States, for example. Some
universities charge 15,000, 20,000, 30,000 a year.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How many South African medical students are
there? (DOTRES RESPONDS THAT THERE ARE 60 OR 70 SOUTH AFRICANS) The South Africans are
paying, that is, the South African Health Ministry is paying their expenses. It is a
country with considerable resources but given the social problem in South Africa, where
all the villages are asking for Cuban doctors, we have actually proposed to them that we
send them medical professors so that they can train doctors there as massively as
possible. It should be taken into account that the black population in South Africa had
very few possibilities to study in the universities. It was a privilege for the wealthy
class which supported apartheid. We told them that we were really embarrassed having a few
dozen African students paying for their studies.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Given the budget available to the South
African Public Health Ministry, headed by a woman who was a great fighter against
apartheid and who while visiting Canada explained there what I just told you, the number
of medical students it can send to Cuba is limited. We said to them that we were really
embarrassed receiving payment for those 60 students so we were renouncing such payment.
Also, that they had to send more students and taking into account the travel expenses,
they should promote massive medical studies in South Africa with Cuban professors.
Otherwise they will never meet the true need for doctors in that country, doctors who are
willing to work in the townships.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Do you know what the capacity of our 21
medical schools is? Thirty thousand. There are about 15,000 medicine students now
including, of course, some foreigners. We had been progressively reducing the number of
Cuban students from 6000 new enrollments annually to approximately 2500. We had
essentially met our needs of medical personnel for our ambitious health programs. Then, we
only had to train the replacements and keep a reserve.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">For our program designed in the '80s the
idea was to have 10,000 doctors ready to help in the Third World. It was at that time,
long before the <i>special period, </i>that all the medical schools we now have were
established. Then came the <i>special period</i>, the limitation of resources and other
difficulties which to a certain extent changed the programs. Part of the capacity designed
for medical students was used for university degree programs in nursing and other health
technicians. But we have a reserve capacity.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The English-speaking Caribbean countries,
our closest friends, who were at the forefront in the fight against our isolation in this
hemisphere, who have courageously supported Cuba at the United Nations, in the Lomé
negotiations and in every international forum; these small countries have a combined quota
of no less than 1000 scholarships for various specialties, and if they need more, they
will have all they need.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In Namibia I had the pleasure of meeting
some people who came to Cuba as children, at the ages of 10 or 12, survivors of the
Cassinga massacre in southern Angola, one of the great crimes the fascists of apartheid
committed there. We established a school for them in the Isle of Youth. On my recent visit
to that country, I had the satisfaction of meeting some of those children that I had
visited so many times at the school and who are today doctors and professionals --from a
moral and humane point of view the significance of what we did is immeasurable-- and some
have risen to the level of government ministers. The head of one of Namibia's most
important ministries given its bountiful seas, the Ministry of the Fisheries, is a young
doctor trained in Cuba, who came here when he was 12, a survivor of the Cassinga massacre.
It is impossible to measure the value of sowing those seeds throughout the world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At a given time we had in our country
22,000 foreign students on scholarships. No other country in the world ever had as many
scholarship students per capita as Cuba, and they are now all over the world, in Africa
and other regions of the world. That partly explains the Third World's solidarity with
Cuba and the 157 to 2 votes in favor of our UN General Assembly resolution condemning the
blockade, although that is not why we did it. We did it for our ideals and our feelings of
solidarity and internationalism. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is our ideology and that is what we
preach, not with words but by example. We enjoy the freedom of being, perhaps, the only
country in the world --mark my words-- I am not saying the only free country in the world
but rather the only country in the world that can speak with absolute freedom, with 100%
freedom. Take off 0.5% if you want, because there are times when --without lying, because
we never lie-- strictly out of diplomatic courtesy, we must be careful in what we say on
some issues. (LAUGHTER) </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But we are a country that can go to the
United Nations, to any forum, anywhere and say what even some good and honest friends
cannot say for one or another important reason for their countries, such as a credit from
the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, or such-and-such a regional bank, or
the United States ExImbank. Our country does not depend on any of those institutions. It
learned to survive under extremely difficult conditions and for 40 years it has defended
that independence we hope to preserve forever, with or without a blockade.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If one day the blockade were removed and
relations were normal --and we already know what normal relations with the United States
are-- we would still be living in a world where the truth is necessary so, we shall never
renounce our right and our freedom to tell the truth.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our international relations are extensive.
We have diplomatic relations with a large and increasing number of countries. But the
basic, fundamental, essential ideas of Cuba's international policy and our Revolution's
ideology we discuss everywhere. I assure you that there is nothing as productive as that
freedom and that possibility of telling the truth. Under the most improbable and
incredible circumstances we are preaching with words and deeds, and that brings great
results.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are not thinking of results for
ourselves. We will continue fighting very hard for ourselves, to provide the best for our
people's well-being. We have something that can be very helpful to the world. We are an
example and examples can be helpful. We have ideas that can help the world very much, a
world where within 50 years there will be 10 billion people who must survive, who will
need solutions and who will not survive without an example, without ideas, without truth.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">These are elements of judgment I wanted to
give you. Later on I will see if I have overlooked something.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course there is still one more thing and
that is thanking this forum. (APPLAUSE) It is thanks to you, and to millions of men and
women that our country can write this page of glory, honor and humanity. Thanks to
millions of men and women like you our country has resisted, and not only does it resist
but it moves forward; and not only does it move forward --I am not going to measure it
with material production data which are still modest but heroically achieved-- but it is
significantly contributing to progress in the world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We must get used to the idea that in this
world where we must live no country can solve its problems all by itself. In today's
world, solutions to the world problems need to be found before any particular
country&#146;s problems can be solved. A very eloquent example are the Asian tigers, which
grew and grew and grew. They had dazzling economies, tens of billions of dollars&#146;
reserves but neo-liberal globalization, that system imposed on the world, drove them to
bankruptcy in a matter of days. No country on earth is secure.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Europe is uniting because a European
country alone cannot survive economically. Great Britain cannot survive on its own; the
U.S. speculators devalued its currency and put it on the verge of ruin. France cannot
survive on its own, nor Spain, nor Italy. Germany cannot survive alone, even though it is
one of the world's greatest industrial and economic powers. It cannot! They must unite to
survive total domination in the economic, political, military and cultural field, which is
becoming U.S. imperialism's number one weapon. We could perceive that in our Congress of
Writers and Artists, that is, the attempt to impose a cultural empire, its fundamental
weapon today. Someone well versed in these matters called it the 21<sup>st</sup> century
nuclear weapon.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Economically, no country in the world can
be safe, nor will it ever be. They are the only ones relatively safe. Actually, it is just
a certain degree of safety because they are the ones who print the world's money, they
have appropriated that privilege for themselves. They have all the money they want at
everyone else's expense. They are the largest investors in the world; they invest other
people's money, the bills other people received and deposited in their central banks or in
the U.S. banks, and they use them to buy companies anywhere in the world, to build
factories but there is a limit to that. The past few months have seen the world close to
that limit, on the brink of an economic catastrophe although, as we have said, they still
have the possibilities and the resources to delay the crisis, to postpone it which is what
they are doing.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The system cannot be saved. The established
domination cannot be maintained. That is the reason we have told many people that no
country can solve its problems alone.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, this very Revolution, if it had
triumphed at this moment in 1998, if they had let it triumph, if they had not tried to
crush it almost before we returned to Cuba on the <b>Granma</b>, or left Mexico, I tell
you this Revolution today would be only a revolutionary power that could not exist. We can
exist because we were born at a specific moment and historical conjunction. We managed to
gather together all the strength that comes from consciousness and human values, this
which Cuba is today despite all problems.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Look that I have not talked to you about
problems. What for? We have been talking about them all these days and we know them by
heart. I am aware of them all, as I am aware of the everyday struggle we must wage. On the
other hand, I do not fail to see what we are and what we have created. It can be seen at a
time like this, when practically a whole hemisphere would have to get involved to bring
together the doctors with the true spirit of health missionaries that we can provide.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Actually, we could simultaneously carry out
four or five other programs like this that we are proposing. Cuba has the resources to
organize a health program --note this carefully-- not only in Central America, that is,
human resources which is where I say we have unlimited resources but also to support a
health care program like this for all the isolated places in Latin America where there is
no medical care.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I say this only to give you an idea of the
strength we have created in terms of human resources. We have created it in many other
sectors. Look that 600,000 professionals have graduated in this country since the triumph
of the Revolution.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, in Latin America there are
countries with more economic and social development than others, such as Chile. I think
there are very few rural residents in Chile who do not have access to health care. Once,
under Allende's presidency, we sent doctors to some areas where they lacked certain
medical services. I am also thinking of Uruguay and Costa Rica. There are countries in
Latin America, not very many but a few, that do not need such a program. But we also know
of many places in Latin America whose population, mainly the rural, does not have access
to any health services.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I could complete this idea by stating that
we have enough personnel to carry such a program to all the rural areas in this
hemisphere. I will say only this and avoid figures. Why? If I say it at this moment, if I
say this and bring up this subject, it is because I mentioned the values and human
resources this country has created, the Revolution has created, with which we have
defended ourselves, resisted and struggled for the Revolution, which will soon be 40 years
old.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have been blockaded almost the whole
time. Some say it has been 37 years and others say 36, but that is not true. As soon as
the Revolution triumphed they suspended all our credits in the United States. On January
1st, 1959, there was not a penny left in the state reserves, still they took away our
commercial, bank and all kinds of credits from the very first day. Later they took things
away from us bit by bit, and the sugar quota piece by piece. That is the truth and we have
resisted. The socialist bloc collapsed and we have resisted. We were left on our own and
we have resisted. Today, we have more relations and international support than ever, more
friends than ever, even within the United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Also, we have all the patience in the world
needed to fight and resist because if we had every reason to struggle on January 1, 1959
when the Revolution triumphed, today we have 40 times more reasons. We are almost the only
banner left for the most fair causes, with an advantage: because it is not enough with
having just, noble and good ideas, it is necessary for those just, noble and good ideas to
coincide with the moment when humanity cannot be saved unless such noble, just and good
ideas are applied.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thank you very much.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">(OVATION)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">(HE IS HANDED A LETTER FROM A RECENTLY
GRADUATED MEDICAL STUDENT)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Comrade Mainegra:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;I would like you to communicate to
our commander-in-chief the recent medical school graduates&#146; willingness to
participate in the solidarity efforts in Latin America.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Dr. Pedro Luis Alonso, recent graduate,
Commission 09.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Commission 09 is the students commission
[at the forum]. (SOMEONE SAYS SOMETHING TO HIM.) (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Look, this is great. We are not planning to
use recently graduated personnel initially but rather those who have spent at least one
year working in the community where they gain a lot of experience. From the new graduates
we need to ask them to take great care, to make great efforts and learn because later we
will have to send replacements.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I think that after graduation --although we
know they graduate with much knowledge and hospital experience-- they should have at least
a year of professional work with the people. We will see how many specialists in general
integral medicine we need in the first contingents.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Anyway, you know that where there are three
doctors working in an urban community one can be taken out, not in the mountains where
they are spread far apart. In the clinics, of every three we can take out one who has
graduated in general integral medicine or is quite advanced in that specialty. Just among
those working in general integral medicine, the potential for mobilization is almost
10,000. Those who have acquired experience in rural areas are particularly important. Once
we have a more precise and detailed idea of what their missions will be, the places where
they will be working and the characteristics of each place we will able to consider
including recently graduated personnel in teams of very experienced doctors.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Aside from specialists in general integral
medicine, various other specialties will unquestionably be required but for that we have a
rich source and potential. I do not recall if we have 2500 or 3000 surgeons. We have
thousands of pediatricians and thousands of obstetricians. We have thousands of
specialists in the fields most in demand now. I can assure you that if we take 10,000
doctors from this country to carry out an honorable and humane mission abroad that will
not affect our health programs, simply because of the numbers we have working mostly at
the basis, in the community, one of the most important places where there are tens of
thousands of professionals.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have also discovered that the doctor in
general integral medicine is almost the perfect doctor for this endeavor. Specialists in
general integral medicine are in very high demand and every place in the city where there
are three --the famous trios-- you take out one and the other two can do the work.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We just took out 2000 and in a few months
we shall be replacing them, 2500 will graduate in August. Our medical schools can go up to
3000 or 4000 new enrollments per year without failing to fulfill the plans I have
mentioned for the scholarships to the Central American students, in case of a pressing and
visible need in the future.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have a great school of basic sciences in
Havana. Aside from that, just today some comrades who are here with us went to visit an
excellent naval officers' school, an excellent facility which the MINFAR [Ministry of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces] as a result of its downsizing can release, and wants to do so
for the program to train Central American doctors. We are thinking of using it as a school
of basic sciences for the first two years of medical school. Now, the Central American
students are going to have it but later it can remain as a Latin American school of basic
sciences for the study of medicine.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have to work on the issue of unity
between Latin American and Caribbean countries which I assure you is moving forward. Look
that, on June, there will be a meeting of all Latin Americans: Mexico, Central and South
America, and all the Caribbean countries with the 15 European Union nations, in Rio de
Janeiro. It will be a summit conference.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We must become more and more united. I have
explained to you about Europe where if they do not unite they are lost. We are working
very, very, very hard on the issue of rapprochement and unity among the Latin American
countries avoiding ideological problems, just analyzing the situations occurring in the
world today which are catastrophic for the Third World, a terrible plunder, not only
taking into account the environmental problems but also demonstrating that this situation
is untenable and warning about all the risks to life. We have to work for unity. That is
why I think that that school will remain at the service of Latin American medicine.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Why do we want to train Central American
doctors? Because what is important is that, in the future, the doctors from those
countries will provide the services. I think of the day when a Nicaraguan will work in
Honduras and a Honduran in El Salvador. Those countries were united, they were born to
independence together and now they are separated.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The South Americans will also have to unite
because they cannot survive if they do not unite. They must unite to survive and still
then the world economy's essential and profound problems will be very far from resolved,
and they will go from crisis to crisis. No one can turn back globalization, nor is it
necessary. Just that it is a humane globalization that we need, something that simply does
not exist today.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How can it be that in Haiti 135 children
from 0 to 4 years of age are dying for every 1000 live-births? All the European countries
put together have a rate of, perhaps, 10 deaths per 1000 live births. Well, Cuba which is
right here has a 9.3/1000 live-births rate, just to give you an example, we are very close
to the best rates, are we not? But some countries, like Finland, Sweden and others are
most likely below 9.3/1000. The fact that some have infant mortality rates of 7 or 8,
while another has 135, and others 60 or 70 is not moral or humanly acceptable</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Throughout South America, except for Chile
and perhaps Uruguay and Argentina, the infant mortality rates are very high. Is Chomi
somewhere here? Chomi, what was the infant mortality rate we saw yesterday for ages 0 to 5
in Latin America, except for Costa Rica which has 14 and possibly Chile? What is Chile's
figure, does anyone know? (CHOMI RESPONDS THAT THE CONTINENT'S AVERAGE IS OVER 40.) Chomi,
I think it was about 45. (CHOMI ADDS THAT IT WAS BETWEEN 43 AND 45.) Well, yes, over 40 is
awful.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">For example, what is Bolivia&#146;s rate?
It is an example of a country that might well need cooperation in this field. You forgot?
(LAUGHTER) I think I recall the figure of 83 (CHOMI SAYS THAT IN 1996 BOLIVIA HAD 102 IN
THE GROUP UNDER FIVE YEARS AND 71 UNDER ONE YEAR) It seems to me that the difference
between the group under five and under one year of age is too high. Anyway, taking the
lowest figures, it is incredible that so many children die at those ages. Bolivia would be
second after Haiti.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Something else, Chomi. What is
Paraguay&#146;s rate? (HE RESPONDS THAT PARAGUAY HAS 47 FOR THE GROUP UNDER FIVE AND 39
UNDER ONE YEAR) They are much better off than Bolivia but, honestly, that is still really
high.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What about the giant, our friend Brazil?
(CHOMI SAYS THAT BRAZIL HAD 52 IN THE GROUP UNDER FIVE AND 44 UNDER ONE YEAR, ACCORDING TO
1996 DATA) They told me a short while ago that it was high.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Actually, it can be said that for every
child under five years of age who dies in Europe, five die in Latin America, and I am not
talking of Africa or Haiti. The Europeans invented modern slavery by forcibly bringing men
and women from Africa as slaves but then those slaves were the heroes who liberated that
republic. For every child who dies in Europe, 14 die in Haiti, and everything else is the
same. This is just an indication of all the calamities our peoples must endure.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, with globalization ideas spread
throughout the world more rapidly and I see advances, there really are advances. However,
I really think that the objective situation in the world today is way ahead of the
peoples' consciousness although the consciousness of the world population about many
problems is growing. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In fact, not only the objective conditions
characterizing our planet today are important but also humanity's consciousness. I do not
think these problems will be solved through war. It will not be that way, although at the
pace we are moving there could be all kinds of social upheavals and unprecedented
explosions. That is mathematically true, exact science, I could say.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So today, Mainegra, we can include politics
in the Science and Technology Forum, (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) if so, I have kept to the
subject. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) </font></p>
