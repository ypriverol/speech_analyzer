<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Relatives of the martyrs of that action and so many other
actions throughout our revolutionary struggle;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Invited delegations;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Guests in general;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Comrades;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Residents of Santiago de Cuba;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Compatriots:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">This is the way I like these ceremonies to be held, with
everyone in a seat of their own. (APPLAUSE) Given the heat of recent years, growing heat,
it&#146;s better like this, at this time of day, so I can converse calmly with all of you;
reflect on the subjects about which I would like to talk today: historical themes,
patriotic themes and ideological themes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I&#146;ve brought some papers, but don&#146;t get
frightened; I&#146;m not going to read them. (LAUGHTER) I need them for reasons of
precision and so that each thing can be better understood.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Santiago de Cuba has received more than the flag, which is
the honor of having been chosen as the site to commemorate this 45th anniversary of the
July 26 attack on the Moncada Garrison, and although it is true that Santiago de Cuba has
been outstanding throughout the Revolution, before it was chosen every five years to host
this ceremony, in its own right, out of tradition. But that tradition changed when the
principle was established that a city had to earn the right to host the July 26
celebration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">They were working constantly for that recognition and got
very close to it in the last few years; but this year, which was the 45th anniversary,
they won it through their own efforts, courage and merits. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On this 45th anniversary, history rewarded Santiago de Cuba
with other anniversaries, so that here we are commemorating three important anniversaries
with distinctive characteristics, one of them very negative and the others very positive.
But even regarding the one we consider negative, our people have demonstrated their
capacity to confront those circumstances, a setback turned into a victory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I&#146;m referring, first of all, to the fact that this
year, almost precisely this month, we are commemorating the centennial of the U.S.
intervention in Cuba; at the same time, the 45th anniversary of the attack on the Moncada
Garrison, a setback turned into a great victory; and the 40th anniversary of the battles
which were decisive for the triumph of the Revolution, a great victory without any
setbacks at all.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">(THE CLOCK IN THE PLAZA STRIKES, FOLLOWED BY LAUGHTER AND
APPLAUSE) Does it strike every half hour or every 15 minutes? (LAUGHTER. HE IS TOLD THAT
IT HAS A LONG RING ON THE HOUR AND A SHORT RING ON THE HALF HOUR) Well, that&#146;s good
because it helps me, it reminds me of the time. (LAUGHTER)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On January 25, 1898, the battleship <b>Maine</b> entered
Havana harbor. On February 15, it was blown up.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On April 19, the U.S. Congress adopted the joint resolution
declaring that the people of Cuba were and by right should be free and independent. That
was a deceptive resolution which apparently responded to the great sympathy for our people
within the heart of U.S. society. It coincided with long years of fighting and with the
impact of Weyler&#146;s concentration policy, which was a holocaust for our people and
which resulted in the loss of the lives of hundreds of thousands of our compatriots from
the countryside, mostly women, old people and children, who were unable to get to the
territory held by the Liberation Army and were obliged to move into the cities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Undoubtedly there was some sympathy on the part of the
people of the United States, but there were also powerful expansionist and imperialist
interests. It turned into the first imperialist war in contemporary history, which is how
Lenin described it, and Martí had foreseen it earlier when he wrote, a few hours before
his death, that everything he had done and would do was to prevent, through Cuba&#146;s
independence, the United States from extending over the peoples of the Americas, and that
it had to be done in silence. He saw the future with such clarity!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Martí didn&#146;t want intervention; Maceo didn&#146;t
want intervention, and one time he said categorically to a group of young people that if
there were a U.S. intervention in Cuba, that would be the only time he would be willing to
fight alongside the Spaniards.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">But that resolution was received by Cuban patriots as
recognition of our people&#146;s struggle and merits, and the people of the United States
received it in the same way. The idea that the Cuban people were and by right should be
free and independent was a just idea, an unquestionable principle. Up until that moment,
the United States&#146; efforts throughout the 30 years of struggle had been concentrated
on preventing the arrival of arms, munitions and reinforcements to our people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the war which began in 1895, all the armaments
accumulated by the Cuban Revolutionary Party through many years of hard work and sacrifice
were lost in a few days. The revolutionary leaders had to arrive under very difficult
conditions: Antonio and José Maceo, Flor Crombet and others, dispersed over there in the
Baracoa area, survived by a miracle. Not very far from there, Martí had to arrive in
Playitas in a small boat with Máximo Gómez and a small group of men, because although
their arms had been confiscated in the United States, the subjective conditions among the
people were ready. A number of years had passed since 1878, since the Zanjón Pact, and
the Cuban people were prepared to start the independence struggle again, but Martí wanted
a quick war so that it would be as bloodless as possible and so as not to allow any
opportunity for foreign intervention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I said that the U.S. Congress&#146; joint resolution was
issued on April 19. When I read that date, I thought, what occurred on April 19? Just look
at the coincidences: the sentiment of that joint resolution was fulfilled twice, the
second time being January 1, 1959, which was 61 years later! That occurred here in
Santiago de Cuba, when for the first time our people were really and truly free and
independent. (APPLAUSE) But even more curious is the fact that on April 19, 1961, exactly
63 years later, our people, already fighting under the banners of socialism, defeated the
imperialist mercenary forces in less than 72 hours, (APPLAUSE) despite the fact that three
miles away there were aircraft carriers and warships that were much more powerful, modern
and sophisticated than those which blockaded the port of Santiago de Cuba on May 27, 1989.
That day, with their blood, sweat and heroism, our people reaffirmed, once again and
forever, that they were a free and sovereign people. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Following the historical chronology, on April 25, war was
declared. On May 19, Spanish Admiral Cervera&#146;s squadron, composed of six warships,
penetrated Santiago de Cuba Bay, which you all know so well. Eight days later the U.S.
squadron appeared and blockaded the port. This powerful squadron had double the number of
ships, the firepower and the armor of the Spanish squadron.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On June 22, the first landing of U.S. soldiers took place
on the outskirts of this city, to the east, in a place known as Daiquirí, which had
previously been liberated by the province&#146;s patriotic forces. Days later there was
another landing at Siboney, a second landing at Daiquirí, and the start of land
operations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On July 1 - you see, July - the most violent land battles
broke out northeast of this city, over there in Viso, in which a Spanish military chief,
General Vara del Rey, died valiantly. On that same day there was a fierce battle on San
Juan Hill - so close to the place where we are gathered today - and the Cuban troops made
a decisive contribution to both battles, since they did not limit themselves to
participating in the battles, but also prevented the arrival of reinforcements from other
parts of Oriente, from Bayamo, Holguín, Guantánamo. Only one group of reinforcements
arrived, marching very quickly and with great determination from Manzanillo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Cuban troops prevented the arrival of the main Spanish
reinforcements and harassed the garrison in Santiago from various directions. U.S. history
doesn&#146;t talk about that. There were thousands of Cuban patriots who participated in
those actions, and they suffered numerous losses, but they never received recognition in
U.S. history books. At the most, there may have been some disparaging mention in the
memoirs of some U.S. military leaders who participated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Nor is it mentioned that, still during the colonial period,
thousands of Cubans had gone from the western part of the island, along with Spaniards and
French, to participate in the U.S. war of independence a century before. There were
Cubans, born here, who participated in that conflict. That is never mentioned in U.S.
history books either, that Cubans, at one time or another, at one time fighting for
independence and at another fighting in what many of our compatriots considered an action
of solidarity and friendship, fought alongside the U.S. soldiers against the Spaniards.
The great deceptions had not yet emerged.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On July 3, Cervera&#146;s squadron received the order to
move out, and in a truly heroic action which must be recognized, they followed the order
and moved out of the harbor, one ship at a time, because only one ship could navigate
through that exit at a time, faced by a squadron in formation which attacked and destroyed
each ship, one by one, as it emerged from the harbor. On that occasion, the Spanish
sailors really displayed extraordinary bravery and heroism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I&#146;m also reminded of the final episode in our struggle
in regard to Santiago de Cuba. We didn&#146;t have any squadron, but two of the three
frigates that the Batista government possessed were in the harbor, quite modern frigates
with good firepower, but we blockaded them and, curiously, we didn&#146;t do it from the
sea; we did it from the heights of La Socapa to the west of the mouth of the bay. We
installed eight .30-caliber machine guns, and we calculated that the frigates
couldn&#146;t pass through there without their decks being bombarded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">When the war ended, out of curiosity we inspected one of
the frigates and we saw that our calculations were correct. Their decks and cabins had
very little protection; they weren&#146;t designed to withstand machine gunfire at
close-range. The frigates would not have been able to get out of Santiago de Cuba harbor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Through that narrow mouth the Spanish ships left one by one
in 1898 and were easily destroyed. Hundreds of Spanish sailors died, one U.S. sailor died
and several more were wounded. The Spanish ships&#146; firepower was not equal to that of
the U.S. ships, and they couldn&#146;t perforate the armor of those warships, those
battleships. That was the history of that battle, July 3.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On July 10, the city of Santiago de Cuba was bombarded by
the U.S. squadron.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On July 17 - look how close we are to the date -
negotiations took place between the U.S. and Spanish troops, without the participation of
any representative of the Cuban forces; an armistice was called and the city surrendered
that day. U.S. troops penetrated the city and did not allow Cuban patriots to enter. This
is one of the saddest episodes in our history, since those soldiers who had fought for 30
years, beginning on October 10, 1868, were not permitted to enter the city. The U.S. flag
was raised over the Government Palace and the Morro Fortress. Totally indignant and faced
with that insufferable humiliation, General Calixto García, who had cooperated so loyally
with the troops who were supposedly his allies, wrote to Máximo Gómez and renounced his
post as head of the Cuban troops in Oriente. What day? July 17.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">What occurred on the other anniversary I was talking about,
that of the decisive battles in our liberation war? Over there in El Jigüe, on July 17,
1958, faced with the offensive carried out by thousands and thousands of Batista&#146;s
soldiers, another decisive battle took place against a surrounded battalion at a spot
known as El Jigüe. Those battles lasted 10 days and July 17 was its most critical moment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In other words, exactly 60 years after the Cuban soldiers
were prohibited from entering Santiago de Cuba, a battle went on which would change the
course of the offensive and, once that offensive was defeated, it would signify a turn in
our war against Batista&#146;s army. It was really a vindication, on the exact date, 60
years later, in this same month of July. The battle ended on July 21 and from that time
on, our troops engaged in a counteroffensive which put Batista&#146;s army on the run,
with its numerous battalions, supported by tanks, planes, artillery, when the rebels had
only rifles and mines. The course of history began to change and made possible, a few
months later, that January 1, 1959, in Santiago de Cuba.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On December 10, 1898, the Paris Peace Treaty was signed,
and the Cuban government-in-arms was not allowed to participate. The agreement was between
the United States and Spain, and the Republic-in-Arms was absent, it was not allowed to
participate in those negotiations and that agreement. Then we were occupied for four years
by the U.S. army. It&#146;s good to remind those with short memories about these things;
it&#146;s good to remind the neo-annexationists about history. During that period they
disarmed the Liberation Army, dissolved Martí&#146;s party and installed a
pseudo-republic through the Platt Amendment, which gave the United States the
constitutional right to interfere in Cuba&#146;s internal affairs. So there was no more
Cuban Revolutionary Party, there was no more Liberation Army, and as long as that
Constitutional Assembly was going on, a U.S. senator got the idea of proposing that
amendment in the U.S. Congress and it was approved, by virtue of which the pseudo-republic
was born (THE CLOCK STRIKES) - and I have spent over a half hour on this history.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) They took control of the country&#146;s basic wealth, an army like
the one in Texas was established, and our country was at the mercy of the U.S.
government&#146;s interests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">But our people never stopped struggling throughout those
years. Very harsh, draconian economic treaties were imposed; they were subjected to
several direct and indirect interventions; they maintained the occupation of a piece of
our national territory, which is still utilized as a naval base; it&#146;s been for 100
years too, and they maintain it by force. That&#146;s how this century began for our
country and that was the conclusion of the struggles in which entire generations of Cubans
sacrificed their lives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our people continued their struggle valiantly and in a
revolutionary manner for decades, going through hard times, difficult processes, until the
March 10, 1952, coup d&#146;état. That event was what generated the need to defeat that
government by means of arms, the event that engendered the action which we are
commemorating here 45 years later.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">It was a long road. Perhaps with the experience we have
today, we revolutionaries would have taken a path that was a little more sure, and have
achieved victory in less time; I&#146;ve thought about that. I&#146;ve thought that maybe,
instead of the ambitious plan of taking over that fort, if we could have started in the
Sierra Maestra we might have accelerated the process of toppling Batista. That, of course,
is based on experience, and certainly the mountains were not excluded as a possibility at
that time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our initial plan was to take that garrison, occupy the arms
and mobilize the people of Santiago de Cuba. What we counted on most were the people of
Santiago de Cuba, (APPLAUSE) given their history and traditions. But before making the
decision to carry out the attack on that fortress, we had been willing to cooperate with
all forces that proclaimed themselves as being anti-Batista. We felt that uniting everyone
was indispensable, and as long as unity existed, we devoted ourselves to recruiting,
organizing and preparing men and women for that united action. But that unity we hoped for
never really emerged, and would never emerge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">So by that time we had about 1200 men, pretty well
organized and pretty well trained, as much as was possible under those circumstances, and
without enough arms for those men. At best, we had one and a half weapons for every 10
men, and they weren&#146;t exactly war weapons, but rather weapons that could be purchased
in gun shops. At the gun shop in Santiago de Cuba, which was near the boulevard, and
through Renato Guitart, we bought several .22 rifles and some shotguns; they weren&#146;t
weapons of war, but neither were they inoffensive weapons. A semi-automatic shotgun is a
weapon that could be considered as good as a hand-held Thompson machine gun, because it
can shoot nine heavy shots with a single cartridge. They are not inoffensive weapons, and
neither are .22 rifles in the hands of good shooters, and we had taught our fighters how
to shoot well. Those weapons served the objective we sought, but there were very few of
them. There were a total of 150 or 160 weapons for those 1200 men, and what we did was to
make a selection of the most steadfast, best disciplined, best prepared cells, to whom we
could give the weapons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Notice what our tactics were: we didn&#146;t recruit anyone
in Santiago de Cuba, except for one; we recruited people from Havana, from the city and
the surrounding countryside, and people from Pinar del Río.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the capital there were many people who considered
themselves revolutionaries; they were looking for people, trying to organize themselves.
Really, there was a moment when we had more than all the other organizations put together.
There were some people who belonged to four or five different organizations, they were
counted five times, and the members of our group numbered 1200, in the flesh.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We didn&#146;t want to do recruitment work in Santiago de
Cuba, once we decided to carry out the plans on our own initiative and once we had
selected the ideal site, which was the former province of Oriente and the city of Santiago
de Cuba. We didn&#146;t want to give ourselves away.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had someone from Santiago, and later a second one, who
was Abel [Santamaría], a very capable comrade whom we trusted completely, since he had
come to Santiago de Cuba as the movement&#146;s second-in-command, to carry out tasks that
were indispensable in the preparations to receive the arms and the men. All the work of
mobilization and transporting weapons and men was done in Havana. Actually the little
flags on our cars, given that our comrades weren&#146;t very well known, belonged to the
famous 4th of September Movement. When a policeman saw a little 4th of September flag,
he&#146;d say, &quot;Ah, very good, there go the General&#146;s people!&quot; It was
easier. I was a little better known and I took the precaution of not using one of those
little flags, because if I did that it would have brought me under great suspicion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">But I must say that in the last few days, in a matter of
days, we transported the weapons by various means. Melba [Hernández] could tell that
story, as could Yeyé [Haydée Santamaría], the female comrades who carried an enormous
suitcase. (APPLAUSE) At one point, a chivalrous Batista soldier even helped the women
carry those suitcases, which were pretty heavy. The men were transported in 24 hours.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were going to recruit the Santiago residents afterwards
en masse, the entire population, knowing not only their history but also the fact that at
the time of the March 10 coup d&#146;état, they were the only residents in the country
that rose up and were ready to come to this garrison, (APPLAUSE) who hesitated to support
the coup, until the moment when they backed the March 10 traitors. I said that we
didn&#146;t have to convince the people of Santiago de Cuba because they were already
convinced, (APPLAUSE) and that when we took the fortress and had 1500 to 2000 weapons,
they would join en masse.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we first entered the Moncada there was initial
confusion, because we were rather astute: instead of wearing civilian clothes, we found
real uniforms from that army, and ones with the rank of sergeant to distinguish ourselves
and confuse the enemy. We could recognize each other best from our shoes, which
weren&#146;t boots; the caps and everything else were military, and we had done some
tailoring to complete the uniforms. We were going to sow great confusion before they
realized what was happening, and before the other units realized we were going to simulate
an uprising of sergeants. It was very similar to what Mr. Batista had done in 1933. That
was in the first moment, while we occupied everything here - they were sleeping, as we
were able to confirm when those in the first car occupied a barracks. They were all placed
face down.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I DON&#146;T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT ALL THE PEOPLE
OF SANTIAGO DE CUBA WOULD HAVE JOINED THAT STRUGGLE</font></p>
</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I tell you sincerely that if it would have been possible to
consider other variants that were safer, if we were to do it all over again, 45 years
later I think that that was the plan that should have been used, (APPLAUSE) that was the
plan: to take over the main post and with the other cars take the general staff, the other
barracks and everyone face down; take the Palace of Justice, the dominant building; take
the roofs of the building at the rear, which was the civilian hospital; and the regiment
would have been taken prisoner.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">It was perfectly possible, I don&#146;t have the slightest
doubt, just as I don&#146;t have the slightest doubt that all the people of Santiago de
Cuba would have joined that struggle. We were going to take the arms out of that garrison
quickly, in case of an air attack, and we were going to locate them in various buildings
in the city, and organize defenses for the counterattack. By telephone we were going to
fool a lot of people by getting some of those sergeants who would be our prisoners to talk
with the squadron chiefs and the other sergeants in the province, in order to subordinate
them or at least gain some time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our defense against the counterattack and the reason we
tried to occupy Bayamo and the Bayamo garrison came out of the need to establish an
advance defense force on the bridge over the Cauto River on the Central Highway. Those men
attacked the Bayamo Garrison to accomplish that mission.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">So we don&#146;t have any doubt about the selection of that
area, that population, that objective, to occupy weapons. We said to the comrades: Well,
our arms are well protected and well greased in the garrisons. We don&#146;t have money to
buy them, but why should we buy them if they&#146;re there waiting for us? With a few
arms, we can occupy the ones that regiment has.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">And another idea: once we had identified ourselves as the
ones who were going to take the garrison, we would proclaim on the radio the revolutionary
program that we proposed, and we would call for a general strike all over the country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">But if we couldn&#146;t stop the counterattack, if we
weren&#146;t able to paralyze the country - and that wouldn&#146;t have been possible,
because the level of hatred against the dictatorship was very high - then we would have
fallen back to the mountains with thousands of weapons. That would not have failed. We had
to start the struggle all over again with less than 10 weapons after the setback at
Alegría de Pío in 1956. And with those few arms and some that we accumulated later on,
in 25 months the war was won over armed forces with 80,000 men and weapons supplied by the
United States; with U.S. advisers; with airplanes which were quite effective for attacking
guerrillas; with tanks, artillery, communications and many other things that we did not
have.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">So the war was won, fundamentally, with the people and
thanks to our trust in the people, the certainty that we felt about the people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">It won&#146;t be easy to repeat a history like the one we
have lived through in these 45 years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We really did it all quite quickly. We had to go through
imprisonment and exile; we had to go through the dispersion of our expedition members,
those who landed on the <b>Granma</b>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was another curious figure: five years, five months
and five days. A gambler would have gone with the number &quot;5,&quot; wouldn&#146;t
they? (LAUGHTER) I recall that in those times people bet on the lottery and things like
that: five, five and five. [Juan] Almeida says &quot;nun, nun and nun.&quot; (LAUGHTER) I
guess five is &quot;nun.&quot; Is that right, Almeida? &quot;Nun&quot; means five [in the
numbers game]? Five years, five months and five days after that attack, the Revolution
triumphed and we were in Santiago de Cuba, and this garrison was in our hands, with all
its weapons and all the weapons of the province.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">There were 17,000 besieged soldiers in the former province
of Oriente. The island was divided into two parts with Che&#146;s forces attacking Santa
Clara and Camilo supporting with his column. (APPLAUSE) The island was divided into two
parts and there were 17,000 besieged soldiers, approximately - according to my
calculations, it would have to be confirmed more carefully, but that&#146;s an approximate
calculation - I&#146;m not going to use the calculations made in those days - while there
were not much more than 3000 of us. There were shotguns, revolvers, everything; although,
I repeat, these are figures that only the historians can confirm. But I tell you that at
the time of the great offensive, the last one against Batista, we had less than 300 men,
maybe only 200.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Since they concentrated the attack against Front No. 1 -
Radio Rebelde was already a fundamental institution, and there were hospitals, mine
factories and everything there - it was necessary to find reinforcements: Almeida, who was
close to Santiago de Cuba; Guillermo [García]; Che; the school of recruits where we had
hundreds of young people who - without weapons, because we didn&#146;t have any for them -
were training under almost daily bombardment; and we even sent for Camilo, who was
fighting in the lowlands, to take part in that offensive. Given the great distance and the
important role they were playing in the revolutionary strategy, the only troops that
weren&#146;t mobilized to the Sierra Maestra were the troops of the 2nd Front, led by
Comrade Raúl. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were barely 300 men in all. The battle lasted 70 days;
for 35 days they advanced and for 35 days we advanced.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">When the offensive ended, there were 900 of us. We took
hundreds of prisoners and captured over 500 weapons, and with 900 men with weapons of war
we took the country, we marched to the center of the island. We had the powerful 2nd Front
- we marched across the rest of Oriente province - and we sent two powerful columns with
excellent soldiers and extraordinary leaders to march to western Cuba: Che, with 140 men,
as I recall; and Camilo with 90 men, who wrote one of our country&#146;s most glorious
pages of military history. (APPLAUSE) They had to cross those 400 kilometers of lowlands
without guides in many cases, after a hurricane, because when they left there was a
hurricane and they had to cross the Cauto River when it was overflowing, march through
those swamps and rice paddies, against an enemy with planes, tanks, artillery, constant
reconnaissance.... And under those conditions those two columns arrived in the center of
the country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">While they were arriving, the columns we had sent to the
current eastern provinces had become consolidated. One was sent to Camagüey, but we had
acquired so many weapons in such a short time that we did not have sufficient cadres.
Several very promising ones had died during the offensive, and a leader from Camagüey
without much experience and with a small column disobeyed an order, used trucks and was
caught in an ambush which caused considerable damage to that column. When Che and Camilo
arrived in Las Villas, the counteroffensive began.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I recall that we left La Plata with a platoon of 30 men and
1000 unarmed recruits. We had learned the art of capturing weapons from Batista&#146;s
army, something we had not known how to do at the beginning, and in 40 days those 1000
recruits were armed and we had extra weapons. In Palma Soriano alone, we occupied 350
weapons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">With Almeida&#146;s front, various columns and the 2nd
Front combined, we prepared the attack on the city. We knew exactly what we had to do, how
many days it would last. We were going to apply in El Caney, in Boniato, at the airport
and on Quintero Hill practically the same formula as in El Jigüe, but within the city:
surround the battalions, and fight the reinforcements. The difference was that in El
Jigüe we began the battle with 120 men and in Santiago de Cuba we were going to start
with 1200 men: 300 for each battalion. Never before had we had so many people to confront
those battalions, whose morale was pretty low by then.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Pardon my incursion into history, with the details I have
given, to explain, in general terms, the concepts and the events that made possible the
staggering, or we could say thundering victory of the Rebel Army. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The head of the enemy&#146;s troops in Oriente met with me
on December 28. A helicopter arrived to the place we had agreed upon and he told us,
&quot;Well, we&#146;ve lost the war. How do we end it?&quot; And I proposed to him that
the Santiago de Cuba troops rise up. &quot;Join the Revolution, maybe in that way some men
can be saved.&quot; Because we had met some members of that army who weren&#146;t killers,
who weren&#146;t henchmen, even some academy officers, the best example of whom was
Comrade Quevedo, who is now a general of our Revolutionary Armed Forces (APPLAUSE) and who
was the head of that battalion which fought hard against us in El Jigüe. We could have
saved a number of officers with certain qualities. The head of the enemy troops agreed,
but insisted on going to Havana. I said, &quot;Oh, you insist? You shouldn&#146;t go, but
if you insist....&quot; He said he had a brother in Matanzas, the head of a regiment, and
that there was no problem.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I set up three conditions: &quot;First, we don&#146;t want
a coup d&#146;état in the capital. Second, we don&#146;t want any contact with the
American embassy. Third, we don&#146;t want anyone to help Batista escape.&quot; Those
were the three conditions we imposed. He said, &quot;No problem.&quot; I said, &quot;If he
escapes because we don&#146;t capture him, then he escapes. But I don&#146;t want anyone
helping him escape.&quot; We explained this at the beginning of the Revolution, but I see
a lot of new people here and that&#146;s why I&#146;m repeating it. The man went to
Havana, we waited for him. The city&#146;s troops were supposed to rise up on December 31;
the second-in-command was also in agreement. The 29th came, then the 30th, and there was
no news. Strange messages began to arrive, asking for patience, saying that everything was
going well. I warned them that we were going to attack the city. I&#146;m not going to go
on and on. The fact is that the man contacted the embassy, carried out a coup d&#146;état
in the capital and saw Batista off at the runway. Three things absolutely contrary to what
we had planned: a leap into the void.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">From Palma Soriano the order went out to all the columns to
keep advancing. We told Che and Camilo, &quot;Keep going on to Havana, Che to La Cabaña,
Camilo to Columbia.&quot; I knew that at that moment the demoralized troops were not going
to offer much resistance. We ordered all the columns to keep advancing, with no cease-fire
anywhere, we warned Santiago de Cuba and pointed out that the troops were moving toward
the city. Starting that day, before 72 hours were up we had disarmed the whole army. Our
comrades in the Movement and other revolutionary organizations took over the police
stations and controlled the capital.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we arrived in Havana, on the first day the police
stations were taken, the city had taken them over. In Santiago de Cuba, we already had 100
weapons inside for the attack we had planned; we had brought them in through the bay. The
enemy soldiers controlled some buildings, and aside from the four battalions which day
after day we were surrounding and carrying out battles against reinforcements, on the
fifth day we had an uprising in the city, for which we had sent arms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The frigates could not escape. In the end they cooperated
with us, and that&#146;s how we got to that happy day, January 1, 1959, with a
revolutionary victory. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">So, as we said to the residents of Santiago de Cuba from
Palma Soriano, &quot;This time the Liberation Army did enter Santiago de Cuba!&quot;
(APPLAUSE) Barely 61 years had passed since that affront, that humiliation when our
military leaders and fighters in the war of independence were not allowed to enter the
city.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">There was total order in the city. What pretexts would our
neighbors to the North use? That the Cubans were surely going to take revenge and create
disorder. Total and absolute order in the city of Santiago de Cuba, not a single case of
revenge, not a single case of looting, because we told the people, &quot;No one should
take revenge, because there will be justice, those guilty of committing crimes will be
punished.&quot; And our city gave extraordinary proof that it was an educated people, a
people with a consciousness, and they were just getting started; we could say that they
were on the first page of revolutionary learning. Those people, who still included a lot
of illiterates and semi-illiterates, who lacked political savvy, who had been deceived
from the time they were in school, who had heard thousands of false stories about the
history of Cuba - among other things that we owed our independence to the United States -
those people were capable of writing glorious pages.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Once the Revolution triumphed, what came next? The
fulfillment of the Moncada Program. What came next? The true Revolution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">For the first time in Cuba&#146;s history, the promises
made to the people were going to be put to the test, because for 60 years they made
promises and more promises and they were never kept. The moment came to apply that program
we had fought so hard for. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I hope you will forgive me and I will try, really, not to
go on too long. I&#146;ve made this sort of introduction, and the clock is about to strike
again. I think someone must have stopped the clock; they&#146;ve done me a bad favor by
doing that. (LAUGHTER)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I want to express some ideas here, so that this 45th
anniversary serves as a source of reflection and meditation. I have to read some things; I
don&#146;t have any choice, and I&#146;ll be as brief as possible, while adding some
arguments that are indispensable.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">WHEN THE REVOLUTION TRIUMPHED, THE TIME HAD COME TO CARRY
OUT OUR PROGRAM</font></p>
</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">When the Revolution triumphed, the time had come to carry
out our program. At the trial stemming from the attack on the Moncada Garrison, I said -
and I&#146;m going to read you some essential parts:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;In terms of struggle, when we talk about the people
we&#146;re talking about the 600,000 Cubans without work, who want to earn their daily
bread honestly...the 500,000 farm laborers who live in miserable shacks, who work four
months of the year and starve the rest, sharing their misery with their children...the
400,000 industrial workers and laborers whose retirement funds have been embezzled, whose
benefits are taken away, whose homes are wretched quarters...the 100,000 small farmers who
live and die working land that is not theirs...the 30,000 teachers and instructors who are
so devoted, dedicated and so necessary to the better destiny of future generations...the
20,000 small businessmen weighed down by debts, ruined by the crisis and harangued by the
plague of grafting and venal officials; the 10,000 young professional people: doctors,
engineers, lawyers, veterinarians, school teachers, dentists, pharmacists, journalists,
painters, sculptors, etc., who finish school with their degrees anxious to work and full
of hope, only to find themselves at a dead end, all doors closed to them, and where no ear
hears their clamor or supplication....&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">As you can see, here there is absolutely no mention of
bankers, owners of latifundia, landlords, powerful merchants, industrialists, oligarchs,
bourgeoisie or exploiters of any kind.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I challenge those who say false things about the
Revolution&#146;s initial program to find in the Moncada Program, or in <b>History Will
Absolve Me</b>, a single promise to those gentlemen who were plundering and exploiting
this country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We were talking about the people then, which is the same
today, 45 years later, with incredible precision and definition.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">History Will Absolve Me </b>continues: &quot;The problem of
the land, the problem of industrialization, the problem of housing, the problem of
unemployment, the problem of education and the problem of the people&#146;s health: these
are the six problems we would take immediate steps to solve....&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Further on: &quot;A revolutionary government backed by the
people and with the respect of the nation, after cleansing the different institutions of
all venal and corrupt officials, would proceed immediately to the country&#146;s
industrialization, mobilizing all inactive capital, currently estimated at about 1.5
billion pesos, through the National Bank and the Agricultural and Industrial Development
Bank, and submitting the mammoth task to experts and men of absolute competence totally
removed from all political machinations, for study, direction, planning and
realization.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">This was 45 years ago and we were talking about estimates
of money held in the banks. It was a way of saying, &quot;No, that money&#146;s not
leaving the country; that money has to be invested here.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;After settling the 100,000 small farmers as owners on
the land which they previously rented, a revolutionary government would immediately
proceed to settle the land problem. First, as set forth in the Constitution, it would
establish the maximum amount of land to be held by each type of agricultural enterprise
and would acquire the excess acreage by expropriation, recovery of lands stolen from the
state, improvement of swampland, planting of large nurseries and reserving of zones for
reforestation. Secondly, it would distribute the remaining land among peasant families
with priority given to the larger ones, and would promote agricultural cooperatives&quot;
- look how early there was talk of agricultural cooperatives - &quot;for communal use of
expensive equipment, cold storage plants and unified technical, professional guidelines in
farming and cattle raising. Finally, it would provide resources, equipment, protection and
useful knowledge to the peasants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;A revolutionary government would solve the housing
problem by cutting all rents by half, by providing tax exemptions on homes inhabited by
the owners; by tripling taxes on rented homes; by tearing down hovels and replacing them
with modern apartment buildings; and by financing housing all over the island on a scale
heretofore unheard of, with the criterion that, just as each rural family should possess
its own tract of land, each city family should own its own home or apartment. There is
plenty of building material and more than enough manpower to make a decent home for every
Cuban. But if we continue to wait for the golden calf, a thousand years will have gone by
and the problem will remain the same.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Do you know what the golden calf means? It&#146;s a
biblical phrase, because I too learned some of those phrases. The golden calf is
capitalism, and that&#146;s what I wanted to say, and I said it. In a word, it is the
famous market economy. If we keep waiting for miracles from the golden calf, a thousand
years will pass and the problem will be the same.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;On the other hand, today possibilities of taking
electricity to the most isolated areas on the island are greater than ever. The use of
nuclear energy in this field is now a reality and will greatly reduce the cost of
producing electricity.&quot; That was long before oil prices hit the roof, and yet we were
already talking about nuclear energy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Actually, at the time the special period started we were
about to finish the first nuclear reactor of the four projected in Cienfuegos, and plans
were being made for a second nuclear power plant in northeastern Cuba, work was going on
in that direction. But despite the fact that we weren&#146;t able to finish that plant -
what everyone knows happened happened - and we had to stick with just the thermoelectric
plants we had already built, that electricity program was still fulfilled, we could say,
since today approximately 95% of the population has access to electrical services. With or
without power cuts, for the well-known reasons, but 95% has access to electrical services,
(APPLAUSE) even without a nuclear reactor. And we are struggling to use new sources of
energy, such as natural gas - as we explained during the National Assembly sessions - and
we are attempting to modernize, looking for other formulas, some economic associations, to
assure our electricity capacities in the coming years, not just for the population&#146;s
needs, but also for the country&#146;s industrial development, its social, tourism and
other development.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We said then:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;With these three projects and reforms, the problem of
unemployment would automatically disappear and the task of improving public health and
fighting disease would become much less difficult.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Finally, a revolutionary government would undertake
the integral reform of the educational system, bringing it into line with the projects
just mentioned with the idea of educating those generations which will have the privilege
of living in a happier land. Do not forget the words of the Apostle [José Martí]:
&#145;A grave mistake is being made in Latin America: in countries that live almost
completely from the produce of the land, men are being educated exclusively for urban life
and are not trained for farm life.&#146; &#145;The happiest country is the one which has
best educated its sons, both in the instruction of thought and the direction of their
feelings.&#146; &#145;An educated people will always be strong and free.&#146;&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">One can talk to an educated people the way I am talking to
you here today. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Today we can&#146;t speak of 10,000 professionals who have
graduated from universities; today there are over 500,000, (APPLAUSE) 50 times the figure
mentioned there. Today we can&#146;t speak of 30,000 teachers and instructors; there are
over 250,000. (APPLAUSE) We can&#146;t talk of 5000 doctors, which was the estimate at
that time, and many of them didn&#146;t have work; today there are over 60,000. (APPLAUSE)
We can&#146;t speak of millions of citizens who pay rent, because 85% of the population -
this is the highest figure in the world - own their homes. (APPLAUSE) As for electricity,
I already mentioned the percentage that have access to it, whether it be through a small
hydroelectric dam or a generator or power lines. There are rural areas in our mountains
where there are no power cuts, because they have small hydroelectric dams there, and
we&#146;re building more and we&#146;ll continue to build all we need, taking advantage of
any resource.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">At that time, what mountain in our country had a
hydroelectric dam? Which one?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite the enormous difficulties of the special period,
with a teacher for every 42 inhabitants, Cuba - which in those times had 30% illiteracy
and 50-60% semi-illiteracy, because being in second or third grade doesn&#146;t mean
you&#146;re literate - has the highest index of teachers and instructors in the whole
world. (APPLAUSE) It gives me satisfaction to be able to say this on this 45th
anniversary. And we achieved that quite a while ago; now we have to improve it, so that we
can be even better educated, as Martí would say, more cultured and more prepared in the
direction of our feelings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I repeat: &quot;The happiest country is the one which has
best educated its sons, both in the instruction of thought and the direction of their
feelings.&quot; &quot;An educated people will always be strong and free.&quot; Thank you,
Martí, mastermind of the attack on the Moncada Garrison, who inculcated us with these
ideas! (APPLAUSE) An illiterate people cannot be strong or free, and we see that
everywhere. We can say today, 45 years after that noble effort, &quot;We did what you
asked, our teacher!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Seventy-four percent of the elementary school teachers are
certified or are studying to get their university certificates, and 94.6% of the secondary
teachers are university graduates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Ninety-eight percent of the population up to age five is
part of the Educate Your Child program: 17% in day-care centers, a total of 151,145; 70%
through informal channels and the rest in kindergarten, 117,754. A total of 96% of the
boys and girls who are five years old are in kindergarten. School enrollment among the
population between the ages of six and 16 was 94.2% at the close of 1997, and it is
increasing constantly since the 1994-95 school year, when it was 91.5%. Furthermore, 88.8%
of preschool and elementary school students attend all-day classes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Enrollment in boarding schools run by the Ministry of
Education was 277,900 students in the 1997-98 school year. Semi-boarding students totaled
657,800 in activities administered by the provinces, amid shortages, limitations and needs
of which we are well aware.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Educational services are provided in the mountains to
152,700 students - in the mountains! - where there are 2400 schools with 12,600 teachers
and instructors, one for every 11 students, of whom 2600 belong to contingents,
detachments and mountain brigades. In the territory covered by the Turquino Plan, over 95%
of the population through age five is enrolled in some educational facility.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Special education - something that did not exist before the
Revolution in our country and wasn&#146;t even mentioned at the time of the Moncada attack
- now consists of 425 institutions and over 13,500 educators.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The dropout rate had gradually gone down since the 1991-92
school year, and is now down to 1%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Continuation of studies in junior high schools for those
who graduate from sixth grade has recovered gradually since the 1993-94 school year, to a
current 99.8%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">As for the continuation of studies for junior high
graduates, the deterioration experienced in the first years of the special period has been
reversed, and in the 1997-98 school year it was 98.2%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">There is no illiteracy, of course. The Revolution did away
with it in less than one year, which is also a unique case in the history of education in
any country in the world. Naturally, then came the follow-up courses to eradicate
semi-illiteracy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The network of institutions in higher education is composed
of 15 universities affiliated with the Ministry of Higher Education; 15 higher pedagogical
schools, five higher institutes of medical sciences and nine independent medical schools,
eight military training centers, the Communist Party of Cuba&#146;s higher school and
another five institutes affiliated with an equal number of agencies, for a total of 57
institutions of higher learning. Fifty-seven! Total enrollment, 126,000, broken down into
73,148 day students and 15,698 correspondence students. That&#146;s higher education,
which I couldn&#146;t fail to mention. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Essential health statistics: infant mortality has been
reduced to 7.2 per 1000 live births in 1997. You know that, but it&#146;s good to recall
it today and to think about how high infant mortality was at the time we were trying to
take over this fortress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Maternal mortality is 2.2 per 10,000 live births. Low birth
weight, 6%; in 1997 it was 7.3%. A total of 98.8% of the children under two years of age
are protected against 10 diseases. No other country has a program protecting children
which is quite the same, despite our difficulties. Over 80% of the general mortality is
due to non-transmissible chronic illnesses and this index continues to go down.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">All the indicators for transmissible diseases, except AIDS,
have really been brought down to a minimum. In that battle, our country could be
considered some kind of Olympic champion. In addition to those already eliminated, the
indicator for tetanus in adults has been reduced to the lowest in history - before, many
adults and children died of tetanus. The same low indicators exist for congenital
syphilis, meningococcal disease, viral and bacterial meningitis, and typhoid fever. There
are no reported cases of German measles or mumps.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The total number of institutions devoted to health care, on
both the national and local levels, is as follows: 280 hospitals; 442 polyclinics; 168
dental clinics; 33 medical schools and institutes; 26 blood banks, where every blood
donation is tested and no one has to pay to receive blood, which is the result of the
population&#146;s solidarity; 219 maternity homes; 196 homes for the aged, and it&#146;s a
shame that there aren&#146;t enough of these.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Of the total number of hospitals, 83 are general hospitals,
31 are clinical-surgical hospitals, 26 are children&#146;s hospitals, 18 are
gynecological-obstetrical hospitals, 16 are mother and child hospitals, 64 are rural
hospitals, 42 are specialized.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Total number of beds: 80,528, for an index of 7.3 per 1000
inhabitants; of them the immense majority, 66,263, are for medical care.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">There are 89 intensive care units: 53 for adults and 36 for
children.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Human resources devoted to health care: 338,983 persons
working in this country in this sector.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Total number of doctors: 63,384. We are also in first place
in this respect among all the countries of the world, developed and not developed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We had talked about our industrialization program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Electricity generation capacities have increased tenfold;
when the Revolution triumphed there were a little over 300,000 kilowatts and now there are
about three million. The problems we have with fuel today, that&#146;s a different thing,
along with backlogs in maintenance, but the capacities are there, they&#146;re recovering,
they&#146;re getting bigger, and they are 10 times greater than what the Revolution
encountered in 1959.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Production of steel, machinery, construction materials,
foodstuffs, textiles and other things have grown several times over, and today they are
facing obstacles of an external nature which we understand all too well, which I&#146;m
not going to repeat here. Suffice it to say that we have had to deal with an ever more
merciless blockade and the disappearance of the socialist bloc and the USSR.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Roads, highways, dams, canals, irrigation systems,
agricultural machinery and construction equipment have reached unprecedented levels.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Remember that I mentioned that in those days retirement
funds had been embezzled, but now not a single citizen lacks social security, and the
number of people receiving pensions is around one and a half million. In 1977, there was a
pensioner for every 2.4 workers. In 1998 over 1.7 billion pesos will be invested in this
sector. In the middle of the special period, this spending has increased by over 500
million pesos.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">This is how the Revolution acts! This is how the promises
of the Moncada Program have been kept! (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I want to add that I have limited myself to a few
statistics and indices, aware as I am and as we all are of the great limitations under
which we are working, the need to utilize all our resources much better and the need to
improve our human labor, the subjective factors, because we may lack pain pills at some
point, but nothing is as soothing as a bit of affection and consideration for the sick.
(APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We could talk about so many things. How our society has
eliminated forms of corruption and injustice: inequality, discrimination on the basis of
race and gender. Before, millions of our compatriots were hurt so badly every day by those
who considered themselves racially superior, and you know that those prejudices were not
born in our country; they were brought in from abroad.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We are a racially mixed people, a hybrid people, a mestizo
people. Those pretensions of clubs for whites, schools for whites, and things like
that....(MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE SAY, &quot;HEAVEN FORBID!&quot;) That&#146;s it, heaven
forbid! And may it always be forbidden, because that was imported with the interventions
and with the neocolonization of our country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Women today constitute over 60% of the country&#146;s
technical work force. (APPLAUSE) I&#146;d like for someone to tell me about other
countries where it&#146;s like that, even though we are a poor, blockaded, doubly
blockaded country against which economic war has been waged for decades.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">What wouldn&#146;t we have been able to do if we were left
in peace to work, and if we were left to exercise our right to have the political, social
and economic system which we choose to have?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We&#146;ve already lived through that garbage we talked
about at the time of that July 26th, 45 years ago, so why do we have to go back to that,
and who can make us go back to that? (MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE SAY, &quot;NO ONE!&quot; AND
&quot;DOWN WITH IMPERIALISM!&quot;) (APPLAUSE)</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">WHAT COULD OUR COUNTRY HAVE EXPECTED IF THE
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES HAD WON?</font></p>
</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">What price have we had to pay? A high price, the price of a
blockade and an economic war which has lasted over 35 years, the price of aggression,
dirty wars, sabotage, counterrevolutionary bands, mercenary invasions worth appearing in
any of the texts at the Party&#146;s Ñico López School, recalling the number of
latifundia owners who took part in that invasion, the number of henchmen from the
dictatorship, the number of oligarchs and bourgeoisie. Can you imagine for one second what
those counterrevolutionaries would have been like if they had won?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">What happened in Guatemala, dear compatriots of Santiago de
Cuba and the whole country? What happened when that mercenary invasion triumphed? What
happened? That was in 1954, after the attack on the Moncada Garrison, and we were
imprisoned. What happened just because they carried out an agrarian reform to help the
millions of native people in that country who were evicted from their lands and were
living in the most abject misery? One hundred and fifty thousand victims, 150,000 dead, of
them over 100,000 disappeared persons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Who made that counterrevolution? Who supported all those
governments that caused the disappearance of so many people? Ah, the greatest defenders of
democracy and human rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">No one knows where the disappeared are and we know the dead
are buried underground, the dead who did not disappear. But the world is flooded with
words, clichés, lies, demagoguery.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Who made 30,000 people disappear in Argentina? Who
supported those who made them disappear? Who was responsible for the 3000 disappearances
and murders in Chile? Who was responsible for the tens of thousands of deaths in El
Salvador and Nicaragua as a result of the dirty wars and repressive governments?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">What would have happened here if that imperialist formula
triumphed, with those gentlemen full of hatred who came to retake their lands, their
businesses, their houses, their privileges?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">A few months ago, a Guatemalan bishop who had published a
report with all the facts about the crimes in Guatemala, after the peace negotiations, was
brutally killed within 72 hours of having released the report. They&#146;re still looking
for the culprits; he was killed for publishing a report that was 72 hours old, and that
was after the peace agreements were signed and the arrangements for peace had been made.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">What could our country have expected if the
counterrevolutionaries had won?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">How many sons and daughters of our people lost their lives
fighting against the bandits in the Escambray mountains and in many other places? They
organized groups in all the former provinces of the country, even in Havana province.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Later we came to the brink of a world nuclear war in
October 1962. As a consequence of what? Of plans which today are recognized in
declassified documents published in the United States, in search of a pretext to invade
the island after the Bay of Pigs defeat. Pirate attacks, terrorist acts which have lasted
decades, assassination attempts which have not let up a single instant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I think I have the dubious distinction of having been the
target of more assassination attempts than any other statesman in any country and any
period in history. And since they haven&#146;t had any luck or success, every once in a
while they report that I&#146;m sick or dead.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The other day I was saying to some reporters, &quot;Listen
to me, you&#146;re going to create a problem for me. The day I die no one&#146;s going to
believe it.&quot; (LAUGHTER) It&#146;s been a high price - not for me, you can be sure
that I almost have fun with all those news reports and those plans, really - but I tell
you, because of the struggle that we have had to wage, and especially against the
blockade, the economic war, the attempt to asphyxiate our people, of testing its will, its
steadfastness, its heroism every day.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">What I&#146;m telling you now can be documented.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">A few days ago, in the United States, a well-known
newspaper - with whose political line we are not always in agreement, whose articles and
focus we do not always share, but which undoubtedly is a newspaper which enjoys great
authority within the United States and the world - published information which proved to
be sensational.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our newspapers, which have not participated in this debate,
limited themselves to giving an objective summary of the content of that information, and
I believe that it is important to reflect a little on this point and for us to become
familiar with this information. We&#146;re not unaware of this; it&#146;s another matter.
It&#146;s important for public opinion in the United States to be informed about some
things, let&#146;s make it clear, about some things that have been done against our
country, about some crimes which have been committed against our people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">What does <b>The New York Times </b>say about one of the
most infamous counterrevolutionary terrorists engendered by the United States? Here again
I&#146;m going to limit myself to the essential parts - I&#146;m looking at the clock and
I know it&#146;s hot, but maybe this material will be of interest to you.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">It says - I repeat, these will be the essential points; I
underlined it because it&#146;s long and I want to quote the text exactly: &quot;Posada
was schooled in demolition and guerrilla warfare by the Central Intelligence Agency in the
1960s....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Posada said the hotel bombings and other operations
had been supported by leaders of the Cuban-American National Foundation. Its founder and
head, Jorge Mas Canosa, who died last year, was embraced at the White House by presidents
Reagan, Bush and Clinton.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;A powerful force in both Florida and national
elections, and a prodigious campaign donor, Mas played a decisive role in persuading
Clinton to change his mind and follow a course of sanctions and isolation against
Castro&#146;s Cuba.&quot; It seems that this Cuba is Castro&#146;s; it&#146;s not the Cuba
with 11 million compatriots. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;&#145;Jorge controlled everything,&#146; Posada
said&quot; - Jorge is the first name of this man, Mas Canosa. If they know him a little
better they call him Jorgito. (LAUGHTER)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Over the years, Posada estimated, Mas sent him more
than $200,000...the money arrived with the message, &#145;This is for the
church.&#146;&quot; That&#146;s a password; don&#146;t think that it was to help any
church; it was purely for acts of terrorism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;It was Cuban exiles like Posada who were recruited by
the CIA for the subsequent attempts on Castro&#146;s life.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Jailed for one of the most infamous anti-Cuban
attacks, the 1976 bombing of a civilian Cubana airliner, he eventually escaped from a
Venezuelan prison to join the centerpiece of the Reagan White House&#146;s anti-Communist
crusade in the Western Hemisphere: Lt. Col. Oliver North&#146;s clandestine effort to
supply arms to Nicaraguan contras....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Some of what he said about his past can be verified
through recently declassified government documents, as well as interviews with former
foundation members and U.S. officials.&quot; The guy had the urge to talk, a real
chatterbox. I want you to know that we know about many, many things he talked about and
even more that he didn&#146;t talk about.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">This is very important: he stated &quot;that U.S. law
enforcement authorities maintained an attitude of benign neglect toward him for most of
his career, allowing him to remain free and active....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The exiles&#146; foundation, created in 1981, has
sought to portray itself as the responsible voice of the Cuban exile community, dedicated
to weakening the Castro regime through politics rather than force. Thanks to that approach
and millions in campaign donations, the foundation became one of Washington&#146;s most
effective lobbying organizations and a principal architect of American policy toward Cuba.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Any evidence that the foundation or its leaders were
dispensing money to Republicans and Democrats while underwriting bombings could weaken the
group&#146;s claim to legitimacy. That kind of activity could also violate the Logan Act,
which makes illegal any &#145;conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure persons or damage
property in a foreign country.&#146;&quot; It&#146;s the law.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Posada&#146;s remarks hinted that the
foundation&#146;s public advocacy of purely nonviolent opposition to Castro was a
carefully crafted fiction. Asked if he functioned as the military wing to the
foundation&#146;s political wing, much as the Irish Republican Army does to Sinn Fein, he
replied, &#145;It looks like that,&#146; and laughed.&quot; I imagine that the Irish
Republican Army and Sinn Fein must be deeply offended by this comparison.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">This guy cynically responded in that way when they asked
him if he is the military wing of that mafia called the Cuban-American National
Foundation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Look:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;In the interviews and in his autobiography, &#145;The
Roads of the Warrior,&#146; Posada said he had received financial support from Mas and
Feliciano Foyo, treasurer of the group, as well as Alberto Hernández, who succeeded Mas
as chairman....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;When the bombs began exploding last year at Cuban
hotels, the Government there,&quot; says the newspaper, &quot;asserted that the attacks
had been organized and paid for by exiles operating out of Miami, a claim bolstered with
the videotape of an operative confessing to carrying out some of the bombings....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;However, he [Posada] told <b>The New York Times</b>
that American authorities had made no effort to question him about the case. He attributed
that lack of action in part to his longstanding relationship with American law enforcement
and intelligence agencies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;&#145;As you can see,&#146; he said, &#145;the FBI
and the CIA don&#146;t bother me, and I am neutral with them. Whenever I can help them, I
do.&#146;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;...Initially he spoke of enduring ties with United
States intelligence agencies and of close friendship with at least two current FBI
officials, including, he said, an important official in the Washington office....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;G. Robert Blakey, chief counsel to the 1978 House
Select Committee on Assassinations, said he had reviewed many of the FBI&#146;s classified
files about anti-Castro Cubans from 1978 and had noted many instances in which the bureau
turned a blind eye to possible violations of the law. As he put it, &#145;When I read some
of those things, and I&#146;m an old Federal prosecutor, I thought, Why isn&#146;t someone
being indicted for this?&#146;&quot; That&#146;s what a counsel to the committee says,
because there have been committees that have investigated, that have had access to certain
documents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Posada proudly admitted authorship of the hotel bomb
attacks last year.... The bombs were also intended, Posada said, to sow doubts abroad
about the stability of the regime, to make Cuba think he had operatives in the military
and to encourage internal opposition....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;With a rueful chuckle, Posada described the Italian
tourist&#146;s death as a freak accident, but he declared that he had a clear conscience,
saying &#145;I sleep like a baby.&#146;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;&#145;It&#146;s sad that someone is dead, but we
can&#146;t stop,&#146; he added. &#145;That Italian was sitting in the wrong place at the
wrong time.&#146;&quot; Look how cynical he is.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The hotel bombings were organized from El Salvador
and Guatemala, Posada said....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Posada said that Mas was also very much aware that he
was behind the hotel bombing campaign last year. But the two men had a longstanding
agreement, he said, never to discuss the details of many operations that Posada was
involved in.&quot; It was like that: &quot;This is for the church.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Asked about the last time he had visited the United
States, he answered with a laugh and a question of his own: &#145;Officially or
unofficially?&#146; A State Department official said Posada was reported to have visited
Miami in the summer of 1996.&quot;</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The News York Times</b> article continued:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;GUATEMALA CITY - During the summer of 1997, bomb
explosions ripped through some of Havana&#146;s most fashionable hotels, restaurants and
discotheques, killing a foreign tourist and sowing confusion and nervousness throughout
Cuba. It was something shocking and inexplicable...and from one end of the island to the
other, people speculated about who might be responsible.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;In his office here in the mountains of Central
America, a Cuban-American businessman named Antonio Jorge &#145;Tony&#146; Álvarez was
certain he knew the answer. For nearly a year, he had watched with growing concern as two
of his partners -- working with a mysterious gray-haired man who had a Cuban accent and
multiple passports -- acquired explosives and detonators, congratulating each other on a
job well done every time a bomb went off in Cuba.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;What is more, Álvarez overheard the men talk of
assassinating Fidel Castro at a conference of Latin American heads of state to be held in
Margarita Island, Venezuela. Alarmed, he went to Guatemalan security officials. When they
did not respond, he wrote a letter that eventually found its way into the hands of
Venezuelan intelligence agents and FBI officials in the United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Venezuelan authorities reacted energetically to the
information, searching for explosives on the island where the meeting was to be held. But
in the United States the letter elicited what Álvarez described as a surprisingly
indifferent response.... Had the FBI met with Álvarez, agents would have heard a
remarkable tale about the anti-Castro underworld.... They would also have heard about the
possible links between the plotters in Guatemala and Cuban exiles living in Union City,
New Jersey, who Álvarez said were wiring money to the plotters. That allegation raises
questions about whether American laws were broken in the Cuban hotel bombings, in which an
Italian tourist died and three people were wounded....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;But Álvarez says that the FBI showed a studious lack
of curiosity about the bombings. And Posada, who acknowledged in an interview that he had
directed the operation, said he had no indication that the FBI was investigating him....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Posada expressed confidence that the FBI was not
examining his operations in Guatemala, because &#145;the first person they would want to
talk to is me, and nobody called.&#146; In addition, he said, no one from the bureau has
tried to interview his collaborators. &#145;I would know,&#146; he said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Álvarez, in contrast, has been embittered by his
experiences as a whistle-blower and believes that Posada has long provided information to
American authorities. &#145;I think they are all in cahoots, Posada and the FBI,&#146; he
said. &#145;I risked my life and my business, and they did nothing.&#146;&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">This is an engineer who had a business. He was seriously
concerned and decided to tell what he knew to the authorities, undoubtedly risking his
life.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;At the office one day early last year, Álvarez
recalled, Posada came by and handed out &#145;a thick wad of hundred-dollar bills&#146; to
his partners. They, in turn, &#145;were going to an electronics store and buying
detonators and small calculators with timers&#146; of the type that could be used with
bombs, he said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;That was suspicious enough, Álvarez said. But his
biggest surprise came when he found explosives in an office closet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;&#145;In a plastic bag,&#146; he recalled, &#145;they
had 23 tubes of stuff made by the Mexican military industry, supposed to be the latest in
explosive materials in the world. I saw it.&#146;...</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Then in August, at the height of the bombing campaign
in Cuba, Tony Álvarez said, he intercepted a fax that Posada had sent from El Salvador
and signed Solo....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;&#145;If there is no publicity, the job is not
useful,&#146; the message read. &#145;The American newspapers publish nothing that has not
been confirmed. I need all the data from the discotheque in order to try to confirm
it.&#146;&quot; He was referring to the terrorist act that had been carried out at the
Cohiba Hotel&#146;s discotheque. &quot;&#145;If there is no publicity, there is no
payment....&#146;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Álvarez said that the fax so alarmed him that he
wrote a letter about &#145;this horrendous matter&#146; and gave it to Guatemalan
intelligence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Álvarez also recalls overhearing plans for an attack
on Castro when he was scheduled to visit Guatemala in December 1996 and again at the
meeting in Margarita Island in November 1997.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">They had invited me to Guatemala and, indeed, I visited
Margarita a few months ago, for the Ibero-American Summit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Castro attended the meeting without incident in early
November, flying in with a protective convoy of three airplanes.&quot; You have to use
some disinformation once in a while, don&#146;t you? To confuse them, since generally we
know about all this information, details and plans. &quot;But before his arrival, more
than 250 Venezuelan and Cuban agents combed the luxury Isla Bonita Hotel, where the
gathering was to be held, and the government expelled the Cuban exiles who had flocked to
the island ahead of Castro.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;There was, however, a curious arrest shortly before
the summit meeting: Four men in a boat were stopped by the U.S. Coast Guard off Puerto
Rico. Almost immediately, the leader of the group, Ángel Alfonso Alemán, of Union City,
blurted out that he was on a mission to kill Castro, according to court testimony by
federal officers.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">This information was public. While we were accusing and
denouncing the foundation, and they were denying it, in Puerto Rico they captured a
motorboat which belonged to nothing less than one of the top leaders - if not the top
leader - of that famous foundation, with two highly sophisticated .50-caliber
semi-automatic rifles with telescopic lenses, infrared lights, a range of 1500 to 1600
meters, which can perforate an armored car at 400 meters, which can shoot at a plane on
the ground, or during takeoff or landing. They were captured by the Coast Guard, which may
have been expecting drug smuggling or something like that. They captured the boat and the
crew and took them to the relevant Puerto Rican authorities, and immediately those guys
said what their plans were. And they had left Miami easily, with those rifles and
everything needed to use those weapons in Margarita.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;U.S. law enforcement officials&quot; - and this was
public knowledge, it hasn&#146;t only been reported by <b>The New York Times</b> but also
came out in all the dispatches - &quot;quickly determined that the boat was registered to
a member of the executive board of the Cuban-American National Foundation. In addition,
one of the guns aboard was traced back to the group&#146;s president, according to court
documents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The trail also led to Union City.&quot; See how
things come together.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The articles continue with background about this character.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Two years after the Bay of Pigs invasion ended in
ignominious failure on the beaches of Cuba, two young exiles [Jorge Mas Canosa and Luis
Posada Carriles]&quot; - I&#146;ve put this in parentheses so that the readers understand,
because it refers to them, and not everyone is familiar with these characters -
&quot;stood next to each other in the spring sun at Fort Benning, Georgia, training for
the next march on Havana.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;It was 1963, a time of feverish American plotting
against Fidel Castro&#146;s rule. The two men were among the exiles who had survived the
bungled operation to overthrow the Cuban leader and had enlisted in the U.S. Army,
confident that President Kennedy would soon mount another attack that would banish
communism from the hemisphere.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Actually this individual, Posada, never got to the Bay of
Pigs. He stayed back on the second wave, and I don&#146;t think the other one got there
either; that would have to be confirmed. For one reason or another, he never got to the
Bay of Pigs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;&#145;The CIA taught us everything -
everything,&#146; Posada said. &#145;They taught us explosives, how to kill, bomb, trained
us in acts of sabotage.&#146;&quot; I&#146;m taking the essential parts, as I said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Both men left the Army after it became clear that the
United States had no intention of invading Cuba again. They settled in Miami, the
epicenter of anti-Castro activity....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;While Mas was making his mark in business, Posada was
building close ties to the CIA, which was using Miami as a base for operations against
Castro.&quot;</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">ORGANIZED CRIME WAS EAGER TO BANKROLL THE CUBAN OPPOSITION</font></p>
</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;It was a dizzying time of conspiracies and plots,
some harebrained, some deadly serious. The agency&#146;s station in Miami was among its
largest, and its officers industriously enticed anti-Castro Cubans to sign on with
&#145;the company.&#146; Miami&#146;s organized-crime figures, who had taken in bountiful
profits under the Batista government, were eager to bankroll the Cuban opposition, or use
the Cubans for their own ends.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;In the interviews, Posada spoke only obliquely about
this period and provided even fewer details in his 1994 autobiography, <b>The Roads of the
Warrior</b>.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Now something else comes into play. It appears that the
reporters got into certain archives and examined documents. The newspaper says:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Now, newly declassified documents furnished for <b>The
New York Times</b> by the National Security Archive, a nonprofit research group in
Washington, make clear why: For much of that time, the CIA was directing Posada&#146;s
activities, involving itself even in such minutiae as whether he should buy a boat....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The documents are part of voluminous files amassed by
the 1978 House Select Committee on Assassinations as part of its investigation into the
killing of President Kennedy. Investigators examining whether anti-Castro Cubans had any
links to the 1963 assassination were permitted to read and summarize a trove of government
cablegrams and documents, all of which remain classified.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Here the article says &quot;newly declassified
documents,&quot; and says later that they allowed the investigators from the House
Committee to read and summarize an innumerable amount of government cablegrams and
documents which are still classified. In other words, it seems that this committee had
access to documents which have been declassified and other documents which are still
classified. But this committee made summaries of those documents, took notes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">And the article says:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;According to those summaries, Posada provided the
agency and the FBI with a steady stream of valuable information about Cuban exile activity
in Miami. It was the CIA that directed Posada to &#145;establish a training camp for
guerrilla ops against Castro...&#146;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Interviewed in the late 1970s by investigators from
the House assassinations panel, Posada said he had been trained as a CIA operative in the
Florida Keys and had quickly become a &#145;principal agent.&#146; He said his anti-Castro
group had &#145;worked with the company direct&#146; and had had arms, boats and a network
of safe houses....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;At the same time&quot; - this information is
interesting to reach conclusions - &quot;Posada was deepening his relationship with Mas,
who is described in one of the CIA documents as a &#145;close friend&#146; of his.&quot;
In other words, the neat and tidy director of the foundation is described as one of the
famous terrorist&#146;s close friends. &quot;The two were active in the exile group RECE,
or Cuban Representation in Exile, and later in a larger umbrella alliance called CORU, or
Coordinator of United Revolutionary Organizations, both of which undertook violent actions
aimed at toppling the Castro government.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;A series of July 1965 cablegrams&quot; - this is
taken from the documents - &quot;asserts that the two men were plotting to attack Soviet
and Cuban installations abroad. One document quotes Posada as saying that &#145;Jorge Mas
Canosa of RECE had paid an assassin $5000 to cover expenses of a demolition operation in
Mexico&#146; and that Posada himself was &#145;planning to place limpet mines on a Cuban
or Soviet vessel in the harbor of Veracruz, and had 100 lbs. of C-4 explosives and
detonators.&#146;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Mas, other documents report&quot; - and they know
this over there, these are documents in the possession of the U.S. government -
&quot;&#145;had in his possession 125 lbs. of Pentol to be placed as charges on the
vessels&#146; and had &#145;proposed to demolitions expert he travel to Spain, Mexico at
expense of RECE and place bombs in communist installations in those countries.&#146;&quot;
Here the whole terrorist background, not of Posada but of Mas Canosa, is clearly defined.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Posada&#146;s life took a new turn in 1967, when he
abruptly left Miami and joined Venezuelan intelligence. This marked the beginning of his
years as an operative for a succession of Latin American governments....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;He got his job as chief of operations for Venezuelan
intelligence with the help of CIA recommendations and was immediately sent to wipe out the
leftist guerrilla movements that Castro was supporting in Venezuela.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;&#145;I persecuted them very, very hard,&#146; he
said of the guerrillas, some of whom later abandoned armed struggle and now are important
political figures in Venezuela. &quot;Many, many people got killed,&#146;&quot; the guy
says.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Posada also arranged for an old friend from his CIA
days, Orlando Bosch, to &#145;come to Venezuela to make sabotage&#146; against the Castro
government. Bosch had earlier been convicted in the United States of a bomb attack on a
Polish freighter bound for Cuba and advocated the violent overthrow of Castro....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Around that time, Posada&#146;s relationship with the
American authorities was suddenly thrown into crisis by an intelligence report that
&#145;Posada may be involved in smuggling cocaine from Colombia through Venezuela to
Miami, also in counterfeit U.S. money in Venezuela.&quot; They saw that in those papers, a
CIA document.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;According to the report, a copy of which is
summarized in the House investigators&#146; files, the CIA decided &#145;not to directly
confront Posada with allegation so as not to compromise ongoing investigation.&#146;&quot;
It&#146;s not clear what investigation this refers to, possibly the investigation which
the committee was carrying out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Posada was questioned, and &#145;found guilty only of
having the wrong kind of friends,&#146; the synopsis of another report read. Interrogators
were convinced by his denial of drug trafficking, the report concluded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Even so, by February 1976, the agency&#146;s officers
decided to break their ties with Posada in what the documents cryptically described as
concerns about &#145;outstanding tax matters.&#146;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Over the next few months, Posada volunteered
information to the agency.... He warned that Bosch and another Cuban exile were plotting
against the nephew of Chile&#146;s deposed leftist president. In June, Posada was calling
the CIA again, &#145;concerning possible exile plans to blow up a Cubana airliner leaving
Panama....&#146;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Four months later, on Oct. 6, 1976, a Cubana jetliner
with 73 people aboard was blown out of the sky shortly after it took off from the
Caribbean island of Barbados. The dead included teen-agers from Cuba&#146;s national
fencing team.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The following day, the CIA made what its records call
&#145;unsuccessful attempts&#146; to reach Posada.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The bombing dramatically changed Posada&#146;s
fortunes. Investigators in Venezuela traced the bomb to the plane&#146;s luggage
compartment and identified the Venezuelans who checked bags through to Havana but got off
the plane in Barbados. The men had worked for Posada, who was arrested and charged with
the bombing. Also arrested was Bosch, who had long collaborated with Posada.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">It was really the attitude of the people from the
Caribbean, those from Barbados and Trinidad, that made the capture of those people
possible. Alarcón knows this story very well, because he debated this subject over there
in the United Nations at that time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;A retired CIA official familiar with the case said in
a recent interview that &#145;Bosch and Posada were the primary suspects,&#146; adding,
&#145;There were no other suspects....&#146;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Posada acknowledged that he might still be in jail in
Venezuela had not his friends, led by Mas, come to his rescue.&quot; See what strange
things exist between these two characters who studied together at Fort Benning. &quot;In a
sworn deposition taken in a civil lawsuit, Ricardo Mas, the estranged brother of Jorge
Mas, recounted how he had traveled to Panama to obtain the cash used to pay for the
escape.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Ricardo Mas was comptroller of his brother&#146;s
company, Church &amp; Tower, from 1972 to 1985. He said that at his brother Jorge&#146;s
instruction he deposited a check in one of the company&#146;s Panamanian accounts and
returned with cash.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;&#145;He said that he needed me to go down and bring
back $50,000, that it would be used to get Luis Posada Carriles out of jail, that Carriles
wanted out, that he might start talking,&#146; Ricardo Mas testified. &#145;The guy, I
guess, was breaking down, they has to get him out of jail....&#146;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;During a changing of the guard at midnight on Aug.
18, 1985, Posada, dressed in a black jacket with a collar turned up like a priest&#146;s,
crossed the courtyard of the prison. He carried a Bible, to strengthen the impression that
he was a priest, and a satchel containing a small survival kit of food and a lamp....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;After 15 days in Caracas, Venezuela, Posada said, he
was taken to Aruba aboard a shrimp boat. From there, a private plane flew him to Costa
Rica and then on to El Salvador.&quot; You see, you can start putting the facts together.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I&#146;m taking a long time, but not to bother all of you,
but so that all of you can have the elements necessary to make a judgment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Posada was working for the American government again,
this time for a covert operation that had ties to the CIA and the local military attaché,
but which was run by the White House.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Have you been able to follow the train of thought so far,
or do you have any questions to ask? (LAUGHTER) If you have any questions, later on you
can get a copy of the newspaper and read it calmly; we&#146;ll try to get it to you, so
that you can really know our neighbors to the North, their politics, their tactics, their
procedures.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">So we have talked about the airplane that exploded over
Barbados, one of the harshest blows that our country has suffered, demonstrated in that
gathering of a million people in Revolution Square; in the recordings of the last moment
when the burning plane was falling and the pilots were describing what was happening to
the control tower. Afterwards, a few of the remains were recovered among the waves.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">It was so scandalous that the Venezuelan government had no
alternative but to open an investigation. As a result of bribes and money, they almost
absolved the culprits, two Venezuelans who placed the bombs and the two masterminds who
organized the whole thing. Since everything was absolutely proven, the trial was held
again and during that time Posada was rescued in the way that is explained in the article.
But Bosch stayed in that jail, and in the end the two Venezuelans were convicted and Bosch
was acquitted. Bosch had a case pending in the United States for that sabotage of a Polish
ship. They received him, they went through the charade of some measures against him,
saying that he had to be monitored, and there he is in Miami also participating, in one
way or another, in terrorist activities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">It occurred to me, in light of all this information, to dig
out the speech I gave in Revolution Square at the funeral of those victims, among whom -
the immense majority were Cubans, over 50, I think there were about 57 - was the complete
Cuban fencing team, which had won all the gold medals, practically children, with a
brilliant future in sports ahead of them. There were also 11 students from Guyana, some
visiting Koreans and the rest were Cubans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">There is someone here, if you want I&#146;ll point him out,
who would have died on that plane, Comrade Carlos Lage. He was in Panama and had to come
back quickly and the decision was made to look into the possibility of his taking that
plane in Barbados. He had already asked for a seat on the flight when he was told there
were two options: via Barbados or via Mexico, saying that he would return faster via
Mexico, and so it was decided that he would take that route. You see how the Revolution
almost lost such an excellent leader as a result of that criminal adventure we have been
talking about. I didn&#146;t know anything about that. I didn&#146;t know, and the other
day while I was looking at all of this information, he says to me, &quot;I was supposed to
take that plane.&quot; I say, &quot;Tell me about it!&quot; and now I&#146;m telling you.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I&#146;m not going to read the eulogy for the victims or
anything like that, but just essential passages, in order to continue the story and come
to the pertinent conclusions. What did we say? We said quite a lot. Just like when I
talked about <b>History Will Absolve Me</b>, in which I said many things which were the
basis of the measures we would take; what was the status of the campesinos; the workers;
the poor; the sick - whom I didn&#146;t mention today. I simply cited the essential
measures which we promised to carry out, and in Revolution Square I analyzed a series of
things which today, reading them again, I find interesting. It&#146;s been 22 years, and I
only want to deal with the things associated with the story that appeared in <b>The New
York Times.</font></p>
</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I said: &quot;At first, we had doubts as to whether the CIA
had directly organized the act of sabotage or had carefully worked it out through its
cover organizations made up of Cuban counterrevolutionaries.&quot; I stated then:
&quot;Now we definitely favor the first idea....&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">With the passing of time - I add this - based on the
information we were compiling, because we had everything: books, biographies, interviews,
people who became friends with those people there in prison; they were revolutionaries,
they gained their confidence, and they were told them things, this gentleman stated:
&quot;Yes, I blew up the airplane, so what?&quot; So we were compiling lots of information
like this and other data as well. A significant part of the information collected was
published in book form; for that reason I am saying: the information we were compiling and
documents declassified by the United States and other means, reaffirms our conviction that
Posada Carriles never broke his links with the CIA. Even allowing his affirmation in <b>The
New York Times</b> that those links were temporarily broken in February 1976, Posada
himself confessed, according to that newspaper, that he had advised the CIA in June of the
plan to blow up the Cubana plane; which is what actually occurred four months later, as I
already read out to you from <b>The New York Times</b> report.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We said that even if it was confirmed - not that we accept
it! - that the CIA had broken its links with this gentleman, what Posada Carriles
confessed by stating that he had advised the CIA in June of the plan to blow up the Cuban
aircraft, and what actually occurred four months later, is very important. Were the links
maintained or not? Did they break their links with him or not by chance in February of
1976, precisely in that year in which the sabotage of the Cuban aircraft occurred?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">He confesses that he kept the CIA informed. What is certain
is that whichever of the two theories is taken, and even accepting that the CIA had broken
links with Posada Carriles in February, without him ceasing to supply the agency with
systematic information, including the plan to blow up the plane, the CIA did absolutely
nothing to prevent it, warn about it, or avoid it. Who is lying, the CIA or Posada
Carriles? Either the CIA was responsible because, in our opinion, the links were never
broken - afterwards I will explain why - or the CIA had broken the links, but Posada
Carriles, as is quite logical, kept it informed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The lives of those 73 persons could have seen saved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">What did we go on to say? &quot;The most disgusting thing,
in this case, is the use of mercenaries who, for the sake of money, are capable of putting
an end, within a matter of seconds, to 73 precious lives of defenseless people with whom
they had traveled in the same plane only a few minutes before.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">And we added: &quot;Those responsible for these crimes
travel everywhere with impunity; they have unlimited financial resources; they use U.S.
passports as naturalized citizens of that country or real or false papers from many other
countries; and they use the most sophisticated methods of terror and crime.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Who, if not the CIA,&quot; we said then, &quot;under
the protection of the conditions of domination and impunity which the imperialists have
established in this hemisphere, could do such things?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">And I continued later: &quot;In June, a group of terrorist
counterrevolutionary organizations all based in the United States... - made up by and
large by people who have been working for the CIA for several years and who were trained
by it - held a meeting in Costa Rica to set up,&quot; I stress this, &quot;a so-called
Commando of United Revolutionary Organizations (CORU).&quot; And I stress it because, from
there, from Costa Rica, pirate attacks were made against our country; they had their bases
there, it was the site of the foundation of this famous CORU, mentioned in <b>The New York
Times</b> article, and for other reasons which can be told in their time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">But look how the famous CORU appears. We had already
denounced these maneuvers and these plans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;In the United States,&quot; we said then, &quot;these
groups publicly proclaim their crimes and announce that there will be new criminal
acts.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In that speech I recounted a list of terrorist acts carried
out against Cuba since the U.S. government made its insolent threats:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;-The year, 1976, April 6. Pirate boats from Florida
attacked two fishing boats, the Ferro 119 and Ferro 123, causing the death of fisherman
Bienvenido Mauriz and heavy damage to the boats.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;-Aril 22. A bomb was placed in the Cuban embassy in
Portugal, causing the death of two comrades and serious injuries to several others; the
offices were completely destroyed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;-July 5. The Cuban mission at the UN was the object
of an attack with explosives, resulting in considerable material damage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;-July 9. A bomb exploded in Jamaica in the cart
carrying baggage for a Cubana Airlines minutes before the baggage was to be loaded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;-July 10. A bomb exploded in the offices of British
West Indies Airways in Barbados. That airline represents the interests of Cubana Airlines
in Barbados.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;-July 23. Artagnán Díaz Díaz, a National Institute
of Fishing technician, was murdered when an attempt was made to kidnap the Cuban consul in
Mérida.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;-August 9. Two officials of the Canadian embassy in
Argentina were kidnapped; nothing has been heard of them since.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;-August 18. A bomb exploded in the offices of Cubana
Airlines in Panama, causing considerable damage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;-October 6. A Cubana Airlines plane was destroyed in
mid-flight with 73 people on board.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">And I continued: &quot;As everyone can see, in a period of
two months, two extremely serious acts of sabotage against Cuban planes on international
flights that were carrying many passengers were organized, and one proved fatal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The CIA is behind all these deeds. In nearly every
case, the terrorist organizations that are based in the United States, where they act with
impunity - especially the five that make up CORU - attributed with responsibility for
those deeds.&quot; That organization, set up in Costa Rica, took credit for all these
terrorist activities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I said: &quot;In nearly every case, the terrorist
organizations..., especially the five that make up the CORU combination, have taken
credit.&quot;</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED NO EXPLANATION OF SUCH
DEEDS</font></p>
</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">And I also stated: &quot;Even when the U.S. Senate
investigated and recognized publicly the innumerable plans of the CIA to assassinate
leaders of the Cuban Revolution and its utter dedication to that task over a number of
years, the U.S. government has offered the Government of Cuba no explanation of such
deeds, nor has it offered the slightest apology.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;We suspect that the U.S. government has not given up
such practices,&quot; we stated 22 years ago. &quot;On October 9, three days after the
criminal sabotage of Barbados, a message sent by the CIA to an agent in Havana was
intercepted. That message, transmitted from CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, states
verbatim, among other things: &#145;Please report as quickly as possible any information
regarding Fidel&#146;s attending first anniversary ceremony of independence of Angola on
November 11. In event of his going, try to find out complete itinerary of Fidel&#146;s
visit to other countries on same trip.&#146;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Another instruction dated earlier reads:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;What is the official and individual reaction to bomb
attacks on Cuban offices abroad?&quot; They&#146;re asking their spy or supposed spy here.
&quot;What are they going to do to avoid and prevent them? Whom do they suspect as being
responsible? Will there be reprisals?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">So we said:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;We trust that the government of the United States
will not dare to deny the truth of these instructions from CIA headquarters and many that
have been sent repeatedly to the same person in flagrant acts of espionage. We have the
code, the figures and all the proof of the authenticity of these communications. In this
specific case, right from the start and over a period of 10 years, the supposed agent
recruited by the CIA has kept the Cuban government informed in detail of all contact with
the same, of the equipment being used and of the instructions received. The CIA supposed
that the agent had managed to place one of the latest electronic microtransmitters, handed
him for the purpose, in none other than the office of Comrade Osmany Cienfuegos, secretary
of the Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On that occasion we were forced to burn, to incinerate
really, an important agent, given the gravity of the case and given the need to justify
our suspicions of CIA participation in those terrorist activities and in the planning of
personal attempts on my life. We burned an agent, and this can&#146;t be done every day or
all the time, but we had to say something about that. And now, it&#146;s once again useful
to recall those events.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I continued in that same speech:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Hence the certainty with which the CIA presumed it
would receive, with due anticipation, the relevant information on any overseas trip by the
prime minister of Cuba.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Those who imagine that the CIA has mended its ways
one iota as a result of the denunciations of its hair-raising deeds that have come from
the very heart of U.S. society are profoundly mistaken. At the most, its methods will
become more subtle and more perfidious.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Why did the CIA wish to know the exact itinerary of
the prime minister&#146;s possible trip to Angola and other countries on the occasion of
November 11? Why did it wish to know what measures would be taken to avoid and prevent
acts of terrorism?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Imagine, 22 years ago we were saying these same things. In
fact, what has <b>The New York Times</b> published now that we didn&#146;t denounce?
What&#146;s new? Yes, 22 years have gone by, and documents have been declassified,
investigations were undertaken by U.S. Congressional committees after I made that speech,
that&#146;s a fact. They contributed data, information that was in their reach; but from a
long time ago, 22 years, we had spoken of these subtle methods, or a more careful way of
going about things; we denounced it at the time. All that, really, is reflected in the
information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">It&#146;s possible that that newspaper has more
information; but for us, they have one part of the film and we have the other.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Now then, a question:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">How can it be explained that, at the recommendation of the
United States, Posada Carriles, recruited and trained by the CIA, and who carried out
numerous acts of terrorism against Cuba, could go on to become chief of operations of the
DISIP (Security Department) in Venezuela, to persecute and assassinate Venezuelan
revolutionaries?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">How can it be explained that after organizing the monstrous
crime of Barbados, he could escape from prison with money sent by the Cuban-American
National Foundation, reaching El Salvador a few weeks later to join Oliver North, that
famous colonel and Reagan&#146;s aid and, from Ilopango, work on a White House operation
to supply the Nicaraguan counterrevolution with arms coming from what later constituted
the sensational worldwide scandal known as Iran-contras?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">After this, how can it be explained that the CIA broke off
its links with Posada Carriles in February 1976, a few months before he blew up the Cubana
aircraft in mid-air over Barbados?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">How can it be explained that he subsequently reappears
organizing attempts on Castro&#146;s life for years, and up until very recently, as well
as bomb attacks on hotels in Havana? Who is going to believe that of the man who, at the
CIA&#146;s recommendation, became operations chief of the Venezuelan DISIP, at war with
the guerrilla movement; their best man, their most reliable man, whom they captured almost
by chance, when those two Venezuelan mercenaries who were working with him were unable to
escape due to measures taken by the authorities of Barbados and Trinidad? And then he
escapes from prison and, in a matter of days, is once again working on a much more
important, secret, sensitive and compromising operation directed from the White House,
under the orders of an adjutant colonel or adviser to the president of the United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In other words, having escaped from that prison by means of
bribes and known methods, Posada Carriles is virtually upgraded to the category of a
collaborator of the president of the United States. Were we right or were we not right
when we gave the eulogy for the victims of the sabotage in Barbados? And how many more
things have yet to be revealed, when they really declassify the documents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">How many years have gone by since Kennedy&#146;s death?
Thirty-five years approximately, and they haven&#146;t declassified those documents. Why
haven&#146;t they published all of them?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our points of view: the planned assassinations and
terrorist acts were not suspended by the United States after the Senate Committee
findings. The Senate set up a committee, discovered, confirmed and denounced a number of
attempts against my person, which were made widely public; no more than a part of the
planned attacks, those they were able to investigate and prove. Of course, when Cuba
denounced them, that had no importance; when a Senate committee denounces them that is
considered as an evident truth, admitted, etc.; but time has always proved us right.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">How could they carry out those operations without the
complicity, tolerance and backing of the U.S. authorities? Everything Posada Carriles did,
organizing attempts on my life until very recently, and he&#146;s still at it; I&#146;ll
limit myself to only saying that. How could he organize all those assassination attempts
and terrorist acts without the complicity, tolerance and the backing of the U.S.
authorities? If you like, I could even limit the affirmation a little more and, instead of
the &quot;the&quot;, say &quot;U.S. authorities.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, based on all these facts which I have set out
for you, in our view the United States was guilty of the sabotage of the Cuban airline
over Barbados, which cost the lives of 73 persons. The United States is guilty of the
bombs that exploded in the capital&#146;s hotels in order to sabotage tourism, to damage
our economy. It would seem they weren&#146;t satisfied with the cruel and despicable
blockade which it is applying against our country. The United States is guilty of the
numerous attempts on my life, in this case, or against any other leader of the Revolution,
carried out by these gentlemen, this mafia, these mercenary gangsters, actively or by
omission in the pay of the Cuban-American National Foundation. And, evidently, in terms of
all the facts that we have, it is actively guilty of many of those crimes and terrorist
acts committed against our country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">But I want to be frank, I want to be clear, I don&#146;t
want to make unjust imputations. We do not blame these deeds on the current U.S.
administration; we sincerely do not believe Mr. Clinton capable of ordering attempts on
the lives of political leaders and terrorist acts against another country. This can&#146;t
be reconciled, really, with the idea, with the concept, with the reports, with what can be
perceived about him and, over the years, we have learned to understand the leaders of that
country. Really, if I believed it, I would say it here, without any problem. I don&#146;t
believe it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">What do I think? I know Mr. Clinton&#146;s virtues and I
know his defects; I have followed him closely, as is our duty, via the news, dispatches,
actions etc. I must say that Clinton has been miserably deceived, they presented him with
a supposedly peaceful and beatific foundation; a terrorist foundation, a terrorist
institution, headed by an individual who for years directly practiced terrorism and
continued to doing it over the years through that foundation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">That terrorist organization met - as the same article we
were referring to here states - with Reagan, with Bush and with Clinton; that foundation
supported the political campaigns of a number of representatives and of some senators,
with whom it came to constitute the lobby via which it influences U.S. policy. A
foundation that has exercised fascist terror among the Miami Cubans; yes, because those
living in Miami are far from being 100% counterrevolutionaries, nor do they support that
foundation, but it has kept them under a rule of terror. That foundation owns all the
radio and television stations and all the positions in the city hall, where they have
embezzled funds - another publicly known scandal - and they have a lot of influence: if
they don&#146;t want somebody to find a job, he or she doesn&#146;t get a job.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Visitors from the Cuban community in Miami have visited
here, they have met in Havana, and look what measures have been taken against some of
them, against professionals, against persons in favor of normalizing relations, who have
opposed the blockade: arriving in groups to harass them in their homes, forcing them to
give up their jobs, forcing them to give up the clubs, even where they exercise, in a
recreational club; they come in a gang and take a car with the family inside and harass
them; slandering people, using psychological methods, physical terror and psychological
terror in the heart of the community of Cuban origin in the United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Yes, in the beginning, it was mainly thieves, henchmen who
were the first to arrive there, Batista&#146;s gang and, afterwards, came the landowners,
landlords, many of whom were affected by the revolutionary legislation; but later an
evidently economic emigration occurred, a phenomenon repeated throughout the hemisphere.
There are who knows how many millions of Mexicans, I believe there are more than 20
million descendants of Mexicans and over 10 million, or 15 million Mexicans born in
Mexico; nowadays, those people aren&#146;t called exiles, they are called emigrants. There
are over one million Dominicans, some of whom have crossed through the Mona Passage toward
Puerto Rico and have gone to the United States; these aren&#146;t Dominican exiles,
they&#146;re Dominican emigrants. And that&#146;s the case with everybody. If they come
from Cuba and have moved for family or economic reasons, they&#146;re not emigrants,
they&#146;re exiles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Given the abysmal difference and the unjust difference
established by the world economic order, from colonialism to date, and which is becoming
steadily more established between the rich countries and the countries of the Third World,
the pressure on those citizens of the Third World to enter the industrialized countries is
tremendous.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Imagine that the United States had done with Mexico or with
the rest of Latin America what it did with Cuba; that everyone who arrived there
automatically received the right of residence, whether they were lumpen elements,
delinquents, prison escapees who had committed crimes, whatever. None of those individuals
were ever expelled from there, they had a right. The only country in the world whose
citizens could arrive in the United States and do that! Automatic right of residence. Of
course, they also had to make some statements against socialism which taught them how to
read and write, and which even gave job training and taught them many things. That was the
letter of credit to obtain a position, a job or something like that.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">If the United States had done that with Latin America, now,
almost 40 years after the triumph of the Revolution, over half the citizens of that
country would be Latin American and they wouldn&#146;t be exiles, they&#146;d be
immigrants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, while they are proclaiming the free movement of
merchandise and capital, they are constantly tightening the knot to restrict the free
movement of workers and persons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">They want the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the
suspension of customs barriers, the free movement of merchandise and capital; what they
don&#146;t want in any way is to apply the same principle to workers and human beings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">To avoid that they are building a 3000-kilometer-long wall,
one hundred times larger than the Berlin wall, with the most sophisticated electronic
mechanisms and exceptional measures. They are forcing immigrants to take to the rivers,
where they drown; cross deserts where they die; suffer accidents on highways and thruways,
where cars travel at extremely high speeds, trying to escape among the lines of traffic;
and every month brings news of the number of Latin American immigrants who die trying to
cross the borders. In one year, probably more perish - one would have to make exact
calculations - than all those who died during the Berlin Wall&#146;s existence; every
year!, and every year more perish, losing their lives in one way or another, due to
economic pressure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">And why do some people try to leave, in spite of the
existence of a migratory agreement between Cuba and the United States? Ah! because the
agreement states that those intercepted at sea are returned; but those who slip in and
step on U.S. soil - ah!, that&#146;s a different law, and they are at war there with the
coast guards given that that principle still exists. If an individual leaves, he can try
to cross as many times as he likes, because they established those privileges against the
Revolution, even though now they&#146;re getting scared, full of xenophobia, both in the
United States and in Europe, for fear of the migratory pressure of Third World peoples.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Imagine if Chinese citizens had been afforded the same
prerogatives as Cuban citizens.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Taking into account the differences in income levels,
living standards historically created as a result of colonialism, neocolonialism and
imperialist exploitation, millions and tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions of
people wish to move toward the industrialized countries. Europe&#146;s the same.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">That has given rise to a growing xenophobia, to a growing
fascist, racist spirit. It is the fear of immigrants from the South. The more the
population multiplies in the less developed countries, the more that tendency grows.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">That&#146;s the reason why they are building that famous
wall which will go down in history, because the Mexicans and Latin Americans will continue
to invent ways of crossing over; but they&#146;re not political migrations, they&#146;re
economic migrations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">There are many Cubans who really left for economic reasons;
some of them captivated by the consumer societies. As we have explained, that type of
society, that squandering is simply untenable, and the Third World countries are
encountering greater resistance to entering those developed countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">But there in Miami, these groups, the terrorist and fascist
mafia has imposed itself by force; and that mafia led Clinton to approve the Torricelli
Act, the first one. He hadn&#146;t elected him president and he was already being involved
in supporting the Torricelli Act; he signed it, the foundation defended it. The article
says that it played a decisive role in persuading the president to follow that line.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The provocations that gave rise to the incident of the
light aircraft were organized from there, from Miami, despite the fact that we had
repeatedly complained and had warned to no avail about those provocations, noting that
they were going to give rise to an incident.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The foundation, which by the way has very close relations
with the opposition in the current administration - it maintains very good relations and
many links with the Republican ultra-right wing - but also has relations with the
Democrats, because it has given campaign funds in Congress to members of one party or the
other, playing with the idea of controlling the majority of the votes of the Cuban-origin
community there in Miami and, since Florida is an important state in the presidential
elections, all those factors have been playing their role there, in favor of the politics
of the mafia; but the real fact is that it has deceived Clinton.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The foundation financed and continued to finance over many
years terrorist acts against Cuba, the assassination attempts and bombs against our
country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">It&#146;s a fact that Mr. Mas Canosa was a terrorist long
before that foundation was established. It&#146;s a fact that Reagan promoted its
creation. Let&#146;s see how they&#146;re going to prove that the imputations are false.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The laws of the United States - as was stated here - punish
those activities, and the heads of a terrorist organization which finances personal
attacks, finances terrorist acts and pays mercenaries to place bombs in our country have
slipped into the White House, there with Clinton.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Let&#146;s see how they can deny it. Let&#146;s see how
they can deny that the boat which was going to be used for the attack during the summit in
the island of Margarita - captured by pure chance, having sailed from Miami to Puerto Rico
- belongs to the foundation, and that the weapons belong to the foundation. Let&#146;s see
how they handle that problem.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The foundation people have threatened to sue <b>The New
York Times</b>; they won&#146;t do so, it&#146;s almost certain they won&#146;t do so,
because the more they go about suing the newspaper, the more they&#146;ll get involved.
What they have done is to question the newspaper&#146;s credibility. A self-respecting
newspaper is not going to allow itself to be discredited; an experienced newspaper
doesn&#146;t make imputations of that gravity if it can&#146;t prove them. So let&#146;s
see if the foundation really files charges against the information in <b>The New York
Times</b> and what happens, because it might have more or less precise data but, in
essence, the foundation cannot deny any of the imputations made against it. Some concepts
still have to be clarified, some minor contradictions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The attitude adopted by Cuba was not to get involved, nor
even to express opinions while the debate was taking place in the United States; simply to
report the news and inform the people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We have a lot of information, we possess a large quantity
of facts, and <b>The New York Times</b> account could turn out to be just the tip of the
iceberg; but it signifies an embarrassing position for the U.S. government itself, because
these people were the promoters of and the driving force behind the Torricelli Act and the
Helms-Burton Act, with which this administration has intensified the blockade against
Cuba.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We have known the personalities of some of the leaders in
that country. Historically, we knew a Roosevelt, who doubtless was a great statesman who
defended the interests of his capitalist society and defended the empire&#146;s interests.
In that epoch there was another very powerful empire, which was the British empire, which
dominated India, dominated a major part of the world and obstructed U.S. trade. Roosevelt
was distressed about that, there&#146;s no doubt he was a brilliant statesman. One
can&#146;t imagine Franklin Delano Roosevelt preparing terrorist acts, assassinations
attempts and things of that sort.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Another president, Jimmy Carter, precisely the man who
established the Interests Section in Cuba and of whom it could be seen that he had ethics.
He was a defender of the capitalist system, imperialism and all that, but one could
perceive in him a man incapable of ordering an assassination, an attack, acts of terrorism
and similar things.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the same way - I take the responsibility and I
don&#146;t think history will prove me wrong - I think I know from afar the psychology of
the current president, his concerns, his virtues and his defects, and I don&#146;t
consider him as being in the unscrupulous category of a statesman who orders things of
this type; but yes, he has unquestionably been deceived, and what I can say is that his
prime responsibility was not having paid attention to the numerous warnings and claims
made by Cuba in relation to these activities; because those things have their history,
they are things we have been following for a while back, while defending the country
against such plans; improving, really, vigilance, security and measures so that they
couldn&#146;t be carried out.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I WILL FULFILL MY DUTY AS LONG AS I LIVE AND I WILL GLADLY
FACE WHATEVER RISKS THERE ARE</font></p>
</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">All these gangster groups believe they have the right to
organize a hunt against me every time I go on a trip. I am more hunted whenever I travel
to fulfill some international engagement than any animal in Africa&#146;s large prairies.
And I&#146;m not going to stop traveling for this reason! Not for this will I stop
fulfilling the engagements which I have to attend to. And let it be known! (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I remember when I visited Allende in Chile that I was
followed by supposed journalists with Venezuelan passports throughout the country. They
had Venezuelan TV cameras with automatic guns inside the camera screen and they were only
a few feet in front of me in some press interview. But what happened to them? They
weren&#146;t fanatics. They didn&#146;t dare shoot because they knew they would die as
well and mercenaries want to live to have their money. The Revolution&#146;s enemies have
always been mercenaries who want to live to enjoy their reward which they receive in
exchange for killing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">They have tried to destroy the economy and wherever one
goes, they are always prepared with their plan, immediately organizing it whether it be in
Cartagena or Margarita, or at the summit in Portugal; plans for all circumstances.
However, it won&#146;t stop me. I will fulfill my duty as long as I live and I will gladly
face whatever risks there are. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I have spent all my life taking risks - I know it is very
important to be morally strong (APPLAUSE) - and started doing so long before the March 10
coup d&#146;état, struggling against and denouncing gangs. Like the tamer in the circus,
I have used the whip. That&#146;s how you have to treat those enemies, denouncing them
again and again. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I can&#146;t forget the time when the prison warden
threatened to kill me. He was enraged - he looked like a basilisk - by an article which I
wrote from prison for <b>Bohemia </b>magazine<b> </b>renouncing conditional amnesty<b>; </b>they
wanted to make it conditional.<b> </b>This was during one of those periods when for
electoral policy reasons there was no censorship. The article even caused problems for him
with Batista. He became irate and it wasn&#146;t often that I saw someone so angry. He
said frenziedly that he would kill me if I wrote another article like that. And when I
returned to my cell, the first thing I did was to write an article denouncing him, his
anger and his threats. I send it off to <b>Bohemia, </b>it arrived at the magazine&#146;s
office but they didn&#146;t dare publish it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I haven&#146;t been able to find it. I have tried to locate
my article, written there at dawn using one of our special methods, a kind of invisible
ink which we used to make with lemon juice. Sometimes I would write on very fine paper and
put it inside a match box. I don&#146;t remember exactly now but I would send the complete
article, quickly and punctually for <b>Bohemia</b>. I denounced that &quot;gentleman&quot;
who threatened me with death at dawn. I wanted to see if it was true that he was going to
kill me or if it was just another of his outbursts. I was curious. And it&#146;s not a
matter of courage or considering oneself braver than the others. I believe that the most
important thing about people is their dignity, the courage which accompanies dignity.
Because there&#146;s no courage without dignity, there is no courage without honor and
there&#146;s no honor without principles. Those of us who defend honor, dignity,
principles and a just cause will always have sufficient moral strength to go wherever it
is necessary and we&#146;ll never lack the necessary spirit to do that. All the rest is
really nonsense and absurd.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In a few days time I will travel to Jamaica to visit my
Jamaican brothers and sisters who have invited us (APPLAUSE) and insisted that we go to
Jamaica. I will arrive on July 29 so that all of you terrorists out there can be prepared.
(APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The August 1 I&#146;ll be in Barbados where the brave
government of this noble country will unveil a monument to the victims of that hideous
crime of October 6, 1976 (APPLAUSE) and I will have the pleasure to participate in the
ceremony.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Two days later I will travel to Grenada. Its brave
government, whose prime minister visited us not long ago, has decided to unveil a plaque
in honor of the Cuban builders who constructed that airport and showed great work spirit
and solidarity. (APPLAUSE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The modern history of this world is being written in this
way.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">These countries were the last to achieve their independence
after the Cuban Revolution and they conduct themselves with great dignity, with a great
sense of honor and are truly Cuba&#146;s close friends. They supported us on the issue of
our membership of the Lomé Convention and even suggested our participation and that
together with them, we fight for our common interests. And the 71 Third World countries
which make up the Lomé Convention gave Cuba their unanimous support because Cuba defends
their causes and interests. In all the forums, everywhere, in the World Health
Organization, in the World Trade Organization, in the United Nations, Cuba pursues a
principled policy and on account of this it is supported, admired and respected by these
countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In a few days time we&#146;ll have to travel, we have no
other choice. Don&#146;t think my daily tasks here displease me. No, travel is a duty for
me and when I carry out a duty, I do it with pleasure; when I defend ideas and principles,
I feel satisfied. (SHOUTS OF &quot;LONG LIVE THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF&quot;)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I will have to go to the summit in Portugal and to the
Non-Aligned Movement&#146;s summit in South Africa, which I already had the pleasure of
visiting when Mandela was inaugurated as president. (APPLAUSE) And I have been invited to
the Dominican Republic August 19 and 20. So here&#146;s all the news you want. But I have
some more news, because we know some things. But I will keep them to myself.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Let&#146;s see what the tactics are, how we will disarm
those people and make their lives difficult as well as their obsessive, money-oriented
mercenary plans. Some of those people are very vainglorious because they&#146;ve come out
in the papers, they&#146;re vain, self-sufficient and primitive. They are portrayed as
heroes by some U.S. press media - even <b>The New York Times, </b>to a certain extent, is
guilty of this - exalting individuals prepared to commit crimes, using phrases and words
to swell them up, such as &quot;their war against Castro&quot;. It&#146;s not the U.S.
agents&#146; war against a revolution neither is it a war against a just cause nor against
a people. It&#146;s a terrorist&#146;s personal war against Castro, as they themselves
sometimes define it. And to a certain extent this type of language encourages them. The
media don&#146;t know the psychology of those individuals and this is damaging because it
makes them conceited and posing as heroes they decide to talk their heads off.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I wonder why this individual decided to tell his story to<b>
The New York Times</b>, say all the things he said. A few hours afterwards they were
denying it, everybody started to mobilize. A plane from the foundation took off
immediately because, well, the FBI and the CIA can't find him, but the journalists can
find him. They know his whereabouts. The article says that he&#146;s in Guatemala. And
well, the others know because when the article appeared, the earth shook in Miami. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">What is everyone in Miami saying? That this is true from
beginning to end, that&#146;s what they&#146;re saying. The foundation ran out in a rush,
looked for a hack and TV cameras and sent them at top speed - they knew where to find him
- so that he could deny the story he had told the two <b>New York Times</b> journalists.
As a matter of fact he said no, that he had never said anything of the kind. But the
journalists had all his conversations taped and they have all the necessary material and
documents to prove it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">One can see from the article that they researched it in
archives, in all those places. And the foundation members are defenseless. They started to
panic. Some of them in Miami realized immediately that the plane which had transported the
journalist belonged to the foundation. It brought and returned him instantly and they put
the material on television and even accused the newspaper of countless things, that the
newspaper was pro-Castro and things of this nature. They were really upset and furious.
But they&#146;re powerless, they&#146;re really powerless and we didn&#146;t even say a
word. We have some interesting things but we said: This is their conflict and their
debate; we will not interfere. We have our own stockpile of information and very
interesting things.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">This gentleman says, among other things, that he has a
group of mercenaries at hand who are walking free. He says that there are two or three who
came to carry out the plans and haven&#146;t returned. Yes. Why do certain phrases and
emphasis on certain things flatter and encourage them? Some articles which appeared in the
<b>Miami New Herald</b> newspaper, although critical of certain things, were relatively
apologetic. Three days later, the individual was sending another subject here with the
intentions of doing what others had done; but one learns quickly with experience although
it isn&#146;t so easy for them anymore. And furthermore, more than one has fallen into the
trap. But if there are two or three and nothing has been published about this, they say
&quot;how strange!&quot; No, nothing is strange. We have them here as witnesses. Where
they came from, how they left, how they brought the means, do you understand? Who gave
them the means and how much were they paid to plant the bombs here. There&#146;s nothing
strange about it. The relevant legal procedures are being followed; but in this struggle
we know the tactics we should use.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I&#146;ll only say that we have proof and nothing else, and
that they shouldn&#146;t be surprised because they&#146;re not dealing with imbeciles.
This Revolution knows what it has to do and knows how to investigate what it has to
investigate without ever resorting to physical violence. It has never used violence
against anyone or any of these mercenaries who immediately confess to everything once they
are discovered. They are presented with two or three proofs, they quickly become
demoralized and start to tell all and cooperate. No one has laid a finger on them nor will
they. We even give them the guarantee that no one will harm them here. Afterwards comes
the problem of the trials and sanctions because the laws severely punish these acts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">But it&#146;s truly regrettable that they go to Central
America, full of poverty and misery, to hire mercenaries to carry out terrorist acts. They
themselves don&#146;t come here, they take sufficient care not to come themselves.
Mercenaries can be hired for 5000 dollars and even some for as low as 1500 dollars. See
for yourselves: tickets, expenses and 1500 dollars per bomb, to what extent they exploit
misery. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Now then, journalists know where the terrorists are. Those
who don&#146;t have this information are the U.S. authorities. The terrorists have gone,
have returned, they&#146;re free to do whatever they please and all this can&#146;t be
done without someone knowing. Let&#146;s hope that the U.S. authorities adopt the
necessary measures to put an end to these groups&#146; activities which are potentially
dangerous. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">There&#146;s an example and it&#146;s the question of
flights, the hijacking of planes. This was used by the enemy against the Cuban Revolution
to steal planes. Nevertheless, it sowed the seed, the virus which spread like wildfire and
which only Cuba could eradicate when, after previously warning them, it returned to the
United States some of those who were hijacking planes. We did it on our own, out of a
sense of responsibility. There were days when three hijacked planes used to arrive at the
airport. It was Cuba which put an end to this invention of theirs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The United States has a lot of terrorist groups; it has 800
extremist groups, fanatics, racists, of which 400 are armed. Only recently I read that the
FBI had captured three citizens who were part of the movement to separate Texas from the
United States. They had written a letter threatening to use chemical and biological arms.
It was reported that they were transporting anthrax, a dangerous disease, in a van in
addition to products containing the AIDS virus which they were going to deploy using small
contaminated darts. They even threatened the U.S. attorney general and that President
Clinton himself could be attacked with these biological weapons. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">There are crazy people all over the world and I believe
that the United States has more than its fair share of fanatics, extremists and racists
similar to those who planted the bomb in Oklahoma killing 150 people in the process or
those who wanted to use nerve gas and explosives in New York&#146;s subway. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The U.S. authorities have a big problem, namely how to
avoid the spread of these terrorist methods and activities to its own extremist groups.
The terrorist extremist elements, who in their time were trained by the CIA and who are
paid by the Cuban-American Foundation in their activities against Cuba, have developed
certain relatively sophisticated procedures to perpetrate their criminal acts. Even we are
opposed to the dissemination of these techniques because once some crazy elements over
there know about them, they could become a great problem for the United States themselves
and other countries. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The authorities in that country know very well that
nowadays the methods used are really dangerous, difficult to discover and that even
chemical and biological procedures could be used. They fear that in the future attacks or
sabotage of a nuclear nature could be perpetrated because with the problems in some
countries, nobody knows what control really exists and if it will exist in the future in
relation to the materials needed to construct a nuclear device. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I don&#146;t want to say much but I think that many people
in the world are certain that money can buy sufficient amounts of nuclear material to make
rudimentary devices which require no more than two or three kilograms of enriched uranium
or other similar material. Scientific literature has shown how it can be done. In the
United States, there are responsible people who are worried that one day extremist groups
will decide to carry out chemical, biological and even nuclear attacks. It&#146;s a
nightmare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In that country, I repeat, there are 800 groups of this
kind - they&#146;ve published it - about 400 of these groups have the right, according to
existing laws, to bear arms. It&#146;s one of the agonizing problems of the current U.S.
president: how to limit and control the possession of arms. There are powerful
organizations who are opposed to such measures. On the other hand, films and TV series are
saturated with violence encourage even children to carry arms to school and kill other
children. These are serious problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I objectively feel that this type of activity denounced by <b>The
New York Times </b>neither interests nor suits the United States. The same goes for the
perpetrators&#146; justification which we are denouncing this night because they
constitute a considerable potential danger for any country and in particular for U.S.
society.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I believe that they have a special interest in combating
terrorism. And I&#146;ll say right here, publicly, that we are prepared to cooperate. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">They, out of arrogance, have on various occasions rejected
cooperating with Cuba in the fight against drugs, despite the fact that no country in this
hemisphere has fought so consistently against the traffic and use of drugs than Cuba. And
not because the drug traffickers are trying to set up a drug market here but rather given
our country&#146;s geographical position, planes or boats have landed or docked on our
territory for technical problems or navigation errors. Or because they were launching the
drug near our coasts or because as has unfortunately occurred, some crazy people had the
idea of getting involved in drugs, believing that it could be something useful.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The worst thing is that some of those who got involved in
this crazy racket stupidly believed that they were going to help the country. It goes
without saying that when they came into contact with certain amounts of money, corruption
and the administration of easy money began. This outbreak was stopped in its tracks. The
disloyalty and indiscipline committed against the Revolution were punished in an exemplary
manner. What can&#146;t be denied is that no other country has combated this problem with
more energy and success. Now we are watching with the greatest vigilance what the opening
of our borders to tourism, to commercial trade and foreign investment will bring. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">U.S. governments have never wanted to cooperate with Cuba
in this field. Cuba, however, has been prepared to cooperate in the fight against drug
trafficking with every country. We have agreements with Mexico and other countries in the
Americas. We have agreements as well with European countries but there exists no such
agreement with the United States. They don&#146;t want one for reasons of arrogance and
pride. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We are also prepared to cooperate with the United States in
the fight against terrorism and we believe their risks are greater than ours. They
aren&#146;t as prepared as we are to confront this problem because they have millions of
obstacles, complications and chaotic situations in their own country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">(MUSIC IS HEARD AND HE LOOKS AT HIS WATCH) It&#146;s
midnight (APPLAUSE), I just have a bit more to go. Is it a sign that the carnival
celebrations have already started? (LAUGHTER)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Returning to the theme, I was saying that we are better
prepared to face up to these problems. That country is very large and, as I said, as a
general rule it is violent; a violence that is often promoted and inspired by the mass
media, the cinema, television, children&#146;s games and other means.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">That country needs internal peace and it really needs more
than anyone to control and prevent the risks which lie ahead. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our cooperation would be useful and we don&#146;t have any
objection. But if they don&#146;t want to, we will continue fighting alone for as long as
is necessary because we have the conviction that we&#146;re more capable than they are to
confront terrorism; we are less vulnerable and we have the overwhelming support of our
people, of our mass organizations and of all our compatriots. (APPLAUSE) We are also
educated, cultured and organized. Moreover, we have a greater experience and spirit of
cooperation and joint work. Nevertheless, I wish to make clear our willingness to
cooperate. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In fact, I have expressed here my idea, my opinion with
regard to these issues and the current U.S. president&#146;s attitude. I don&#146;t have
to warn him so that they don&#146;t say afterwards that &quot;Castro warns U.S.
President.&quot; I simply say that I perceive a man who is concerned about many of his
country&#146;s problems, a man with a sense of responsibility and concerns about the
future. He even speaks of a personal historical legacy. It&#146;s not that I agree for I
feel that no one has the right to think of personal historical legacies. As Martí once
said, all the world&#146;s glory fits into a grain of corn. But taking into account his
concerns, it is to be assumed that he understands and perceives realities and truths, that
he meditates on and analyses information given to him about Cuba, that he&#146;s aware of
the responsibility which his country has for the injustices committed against our nation
during the course of history. And that he deigns to take into account the words we have
pronounced today in the name of a small, but yet courageous, heroic and unyielding people.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">OUR WISH TODAY, 45 YEARS LATER, IS THAT OUR PEOPLE STUDY
AND GET AN EDUCATION</font></p>
</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I&#146;ll only say one thing to the new generations: 45
years have passed since the assault on the Moncada. Our country has been struggling for
its independence and its rights for more than a century. Maceo, Gómez and other fighters
struggled from 1868 until 1898. They suffered the humiliation of not being able to hoist
their flag in this heroic city, of not even being able to enter it after 30 years of a
self-sacrificing, admirable and heroic struggle. But the day came when those flags were
hoisted and their ideas triumphed, ideas which were ever-changing and which never stopped
evolving into something better. Every new idea can be a step towards the pinnacle of human
progress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We borrowed ideas from philosophers, thinkers and
revolutionaries. Our people has contributed new ideas and will continue to do so.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We&#146;re living in an interesting and exceptional world,
of which we have talked on other occasions. A world in the throes of globalization which
brings with it tremendous problems and enormous challenges. Our main interest is that our
people have the knowledge, the culture and, above all, the political and scientific
awareness to prepare itself for this world which is enveloping us at a very fast rate. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our wish today, 45 years afterwards, is that our people
study and get an education. We have to look further afield, work out new ideas, set new
targets, new principles stemming from the same feelings, eternal love for human dignity
and justice which brought us here amidst so many obstacles, struggling against the most
powerful empire in world history which has placed enormous obstacles in our path over
which we have triumphed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We will continue fighting for we have reason enough to feel
confident.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In January of next year, we are going to have in Cuba a
very important meeting of economists with a public debate of all ideas ranging from
capitalism to neoliberalism. The central theme will be globalization and neoliberalism. I
believe that it&#146;s going to be a very serious debate. We&#146;re going to have the
opportunity to touch on the most important matters of the present and the future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We have many contacts with many leaders and personalities
from abroad and I can assure you that we&#146;re witnessing a growing concern and interest
in all these problems whose detailed analysis will help us prepare for this new world
which is emerging.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We remind the new generation that our Cuban patriots fought
selflessly and heroically for 30 years and yet for 60 years afterwards, our freedom was
snatched away to be given to the transnationals, the privileged, the oligarchs, the
corrupt and the rich.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Although some people have become rich for reasons which you
already know, today we have a country which hasn&#146;t been handed over to nor will it
ever be handed over to the wealthy, the oligarchs, the bourgeoisie, plunderers or the
corrupt. We&#146;re aware of the vices which affect us, of the factors which influence us,
of the many things we have to fight against and the many things we still have to perfect.
But we won&#146;t be discouraged, we trust in our ideas and we have confidence in our
people. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our generation has fulfilled its duty after having
struggled without respite for 45 years, from that July 26, 1953 onwards, maintaining a
steadfast position of principles, with the same ideas that inspired us that day.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">They say that with the passing of time, people become
conservative and it&#146;s partly true. As a rule, young people are disinterested,
altruistic and intrepid. But everything depends on ideas. We have had the strength of
ideas which we have defended and we think exactly the same today as we used to think then.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We have a little bit more experience and knowledge. We have
learned something during these 45 years and we will try to pass it on to the next
generation, the new generation who today have important responsibilities. Just as we add
30 years from the past century and 45 from this one to arrive at a figure of 75, we have
been fighting for 130 years from 1868 until now. But before our compatriots were fighting
to win their independence and sovereignty which they never saw. We had the privilege to
see it in reality and we urge the upcoming generations to seize these ideas, to forge
their spirit in this struggle, to carry onwards that struggle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Today there are higher ideals. Before we were fighting for
our country; today we&#146;re fighting for the world and we&#146;re doing so for two
reasons. (APPLAUSE) Firstly, we have acquired an awareness of humanity, so beautifully
expressed in Martí&#146;s phrase, &quot;The homeland is humanity&quot;. (APPLAUSE)
Secondly, because we have acquired these concepts through Martí&#146;s teachings and our
political, revolutionary, Marxist, Leninist, socialist education. We have pooled the
essence of our thinkers&#146; best ideas with that of foreign thinkers, which has helped
to strengthen and develop our present ideals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We&#146;re patriots but we&#146;re also internationalists.
No people has demonstrated this better than we have. No people was capable of voluntarily
sending more than half a million of its sons and daughters to carry out difficult missions
in other parts of the world. And what we have sown, nobody will be able to destroy. A tree
can fall because it has weak roots but no tree with deep roots can ever be uprooted
(APPLAUSE) and we have millions of citizens with deep roots and a people with deep roots.
Let our young educated and cultured people know how to acquire it, know how to understand
it; know how to take from history; know how to feed from the glory of our nation, its
traditions and its values just as children feed from their mothers&#146; breasts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Don&#146;t let yourselves be confused by anything,
don&#146;t ever let anyone deceive you. This is our hope, that our country never goes
backwards, that this Revolution never goes backwards and that all the dignity and glory
which we have acquired can never be destroyed. (APPLAUSE) This is our commitment and our
pledge to our glorious and heroic comrades who have given their lives for this cause. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Long live Santiago de Cuba! (SHOUTS OF &quot;LONG
LIVE!&quot;)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Long live the city which bears with dignity the name of
Hero City! (SHOUTS OF &quot;LONG LIVE!&quot;)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Long live the cradle of the Revolution! (SHOUTS OF
&quot;LONG LIVE!&quot;)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">With pride we proclaim today and with pride we repeat:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Socialism or death!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Patria o muerte!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Venceremos!</font></p>
