FIDEL CASTRO AT THE CLOSING CEREMONY OF THE COMMITTEES FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE REVOLUTION 5<sup>TH</sup>
NATIONAL CONGRESS. CITY OF HAVANA. 28 SEPTEMBER 1998</strong></font></b></p>
<font SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font face="Arial" size="3">Honorable guests,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Dear delegates to the 5th Congress of the
CDRs [Committees for the Defense of the Revolution], for the unity that we defend.
(Applause.)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I think we have just won a second victory
with the excellent development and the results of this Congress, with the hurricane or
without the hurricane, even under the hurricane or pursued by the hurricane (Laughter),
which got here right behind us, although without very strong winds but with enough rain to
really soak the Karl Marx Theater, where we would have had 4,000 to 5,000 guests today if
flood water had not seeped in affecting the electrical services. Our people were able to
re-establish the service in 24 hours but a certain danger remained associated with
electricity. That is why we preferred, as we had anticipated, in case we could not use the
Karl Marx Theater, to close the Congress right here where we have been working.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We hope that those who would have been
invited to be here have the chance to see it on television, because this function is being
broadcast live.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I hope that Marquitos has reserved as much
electricity as possible for the people in Havana, and the rest too. We know that they have
re-established 90 percent of the service in almost every the province. In Guantánamo,
they already had 75 percent or so two days ago. What is the situation like now, Marquitos?
(Marcos says that we are already above 90 percent practically in the whole country.)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Above 90 percent in practically the whole
country, are we? So are the CDR members listening to us? Is there electricity? (He is told
there is.) Well, the newspaper or some other news can get to you later, but we are really
pleased that, in such a short time, they have re-established electricity and
communications in general. All the roads now also permit communications.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have talked about the Congress. It is
not necessary for us to elaborate on that very much. Part of what we have discussed has
been broadcast on radio, television and other media.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We also have the complete report, with the
small modifications introduced to make it more accurate. Certain things no longer appear
as if they were current or normal, and you can now take it plus the ones that will be
printed, so that at least one copy reaches every defense CDR. You know that there are over
100,000 of them, and we hall have a bit more for other mass organizations to receive a
copy of the report. As I have already said to you, it had been very well done and it
really reflects the extraordinary effort put in by yourselves; extraordinary, growing and
so necessary effort, which can be measured in facts. They are all here. (He shows
documents.) </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I did not bring all the papers but we
remember many of them and I am not going to repeat them. It is enough to point out that an
impressive record has been broken in this tough year, with 570,000 blood donations and
almost all the rates show an improvement. I hope that it is not just because this is the
year of the Congress and that, on the contrary, as a result of the Congress the rates will
continue improving. Some are already very difficult to surpass.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Let us say that the 91 percent
participation of the people in the CDRs is a really high and encouraging rate which,
unquestionably makes this organization the broadest in the whole country, with over seven
million affiliates. This does not include the children, who are also starting to organize
with them, apart from their pioneers organization. It is a beautiful idea, that one about
the children's CDRs, as part of an education and a motivation for them.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That participation allows you all to work
more within the organization, since you have proposed doing a better job and exercising a
greater influence on the community. After all we have seen, I do not have the slightest
doubt that you will make it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You had old tasks; now you have new tasks
and the new ones are strategic. The subjects raised about the development of patriotic and
revolutionary values and the ideological battle are enormously important. The fight
against crime and the fight against illegalities together with your active participation
in cooperation with the country's other forces and the Ministry of the Interior and the
Revolutionary National Police are really transcendental.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We discussed that issue a lot yesterday and
we agreed that we had to continue discussing with the most resolute determination to face
up to those difficulties and wage a fierce battle against them. We must do it with
organization, intelligence, the most suitable methods of control, pressure, persuasion and
social influence, as we talked about here and there is no need to repeat it. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am sure that all your comrades throughout
the country, the millions of CDR members who are the vast majority of the people, and the
rest too, and even some delinquents are going to be happy, because they do not like being
robbed either. They are going to be happy if there is less theft because they must also be
victims of their own theft. Everybody will have more peace of mind. This is one of the
issues that most affect all citizens.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The fight against illegalities is crucial.
The battle for the survival of the Revolution and the defense of the Revolution is very
closely linked to the ideological battle. The enemy, as has been said already, uses every
possible means concentrating today against Cuba in this field.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have said to you that, in a cable
yesterday, we saw the amazing news that in 1964 the United States had been very close to
launching a nuclear attack against China. I say amazing because no matter how used we are
to the incredible things that our northern neighbors do, an information like that is bound
to be amazing. I am not making this up. One of the newspapers with the highest circulation
in the United States has published it, on the basis of declassified documents from the
State Department.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have often denounced facts but it is
necessary to wait years for the famous declassified documents to appear: CIA documents on
plans and actions against Cuba, Pentagon documents that reveal, for example, how they
received instructions to concoct a pretext for a direct military invasion of Cuba after
the mercenary invasion and the defeat at Girón [the Bay of Pigs]. These objectives were
known since that time. They led to the measures taken by Cuba and the USSR which gave rise
to the October Crisis in 1962 [the Cuban Missile Crisis].</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Documents and new documents constantly
appear. Some have not been published, of course, and others they might publish perhaps in
200 years. They have got all that well regulated.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As I said, they always surprise us with
plans like those I mentioned to you today. Nowadays, of course, relations between the
United States and China are normal, they are going quite well. The United States has
understood what China is, the enormous real power and, above all, the potential of that
country in the scientific, economic, military and many other fields. They have been more
realistic in the case of China which is also an enormous and growing market of hundreds of
billions of dollars.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Some of their spokesmen have said, with the
greatest cynicism, that with China it is worth the trouble changing from the policy of
confrontation to trading, even it is a socialist country because it is also an enormous
market for exports and an enormous field for investment, with a trained, disciplined and
cheap workforce. They know that they can not do without that in the economic field, as
they also know that they can not do without China in the political field.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At this very moment, the time of a serious
international economic crisis, of which I will speak later, the Chinese are making an
important contribution to prevent disaster by avoiding the devaluation of the yuan, their
currency, which is only partly convertible, only to a limited extent. That is one reason
the Asian crisis has barely hit China. But, it is a currency whose devaluation would have
terrible consequences and possibly lead to a catastrophic outcome of the economic crisis.
It would aggravate the situation in all the countries of Southeast Asia and it would
aggravate the situation of the yen, the currency of Japan, which is the world's second
largest economy and which is now going through a very difficult recession.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All that has a tremendous influence on the
world economic situation and seriously increases the risks that the crisis will inevitably
become universal.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is, at this time, the People's
Republic of China, at a cost of tens of billions of dollars, is supporting the value of
the yuan whose devaluation would be the best condition for competing with the goods from
Southeast Asia, which are now being sold much more cheaply after the dramatic devaluation
of their currencies. China, of course, is losing sales, losing markets, and not just the
sales it is losing because of the blow those countries' economies have suffered but also
by way of these products competition in the present circumstances.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We will see Latin America and many other
countries flooded with goods from the so-called tigers, as they are now trying desperately
to increase their exports. In other words, China is not only an enormous market and an
enormous field for investment. China is also an important player in the world economy and
it has steadfastly resisted the need to devalue its currency, which has been an important
contribution to the international economy. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, nobody can be sure that, when
all is said and done, the great sacrifice they are now making, an unquestionable proof of
China's responsibility and its concern over world affairs, will have any result. It might
perhaps delay the crisis, avoid a rapid and general outcome but, all the indicators show
that, sooner or later, this crisis is bound to arrive.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, now there is no longer that
hostility, that blockade, that economic warfare against China. Quite the opposite. There
is substantial investment and considerable mutual trade. I believe that the Chinese are
exporting a lot more than 50 billion [dollars] to the United States, if I am not wrong,
despite the yuan not being devalued and despite the competition from the others. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The President of the United States visited
that country where he met with the leaders and talked to the people. The Chinese opened up
the doors for him. He was welcomed almost as a Pope and, like us, they made the national
media available to him so that he could talk to all Chinese. He really believed that he
was talking to them but, the truth is that it occurred to him to take some translators of
the Chinese language. You all know that, at times, when someone whose mother tongue is
English speaks Spanish, he gets tangled up, so you can imagine someone whose mother
language is English speaking in Chinese. On the other hand, the Chinese spoken in Peking
is not understood in Canton, Shanghai and a lot of other places.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As I was telling you, he believed that he
was talking to 1,200 million Chinese. As far as we know, the vast majority of the Chinese
were quite annoyed because they could not understand the translators. Later, he visited
the University of Peking and, again with the same translators, he gave his speech there,
he spoke very well, very pleased, very happy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am recalling this to describe the
relations. The socialist bloc does not exist and relations are excellent with many of its
fragments; some of them have been invited to join NATO and they have accepted. As for
Russia, they are scared, but not of its nuclear weapons or of a confrontation, they are
scared at the really huge economic crisis that has been sweeping through Russia and is
threatening to spread out quickly to other parts of the global economy. They are deeply
scared of that and are trying to see what they can do, but they are virtually conceding
their helplessness. I will give you some information about that later on.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is, they no longer have where to
concentrate their attacks, their hostility. Plundering is something else. Investing what
is theirs and what is not theirs is something else again. But it is not economic warfare.
It is not hostility. There is still another country, for example, the (People&#146;s)
Democratic Republic of Korea. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Koreans were building a nuclear reactor
there and, out of fear, to convince them not to build that nuclear reactor, arguing the
need for a safe technology, they are going to supply the resources, I mean, the United
States, Japan and South Korea for the construction of two nuclear reactors and, in the
meantime, they are also supplying it with some 500,000 tons of fuel for the thermoelectric
plants. In other words, although there is still a high level of confrontation with that
country, it is a different situation. They have even got that far.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Regarding Cuba, it is all different. Well,
they have prevented Russia from continuing the construction of the nuclear plant in
Cienfuegos. In theory, the Russians have promised to proceed with the construction, but
that is a slow process. It takes time, a lot of time. Cooperation might happen to be
maintained there and some supplies for the maintenance of what has been built, but it
would be a delusion to count on that for now, for a long time and even more so taking into
account the terrible situation in that country. Meanwhile, they are campaigning against
everything that might appear to be a nuclear plant in Cuba and saying that it poses a
danger for the United States. They can build a hundred in their territory, but us, none or
they make it a world scandal, even if it is authorized by the International Atomic Energy
Agency and have all the safeguards. That is why we have to look for other sources of
energy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Relations with Vietnam, are similar to
those with China: investment. We are delighted that the Vietnamese, who have struggled so
much, who lost four million people, not including the disabled and other damage and human
suffering, now have the opportunity to live in peace, to trade and develop, without
renouncing their principles, the ideas of socialism.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am telling you this to demonstrate that
everything, absolutely everything is against Cuba, their nearest neighbor, the ripe apple
that never fell and will never fall from the tree and which they were expecting to take,
as they said a long, long time ago. Because, almost since that country was founded, its
first political leaders raised the matter of Cuba&#146;s occupation. That was in their
plans. Our predecessors prevented it and it is our duty to make it impossible. We have
done that up until now and we will continue doing so. But all their propaganda resources,
all the campaigns, all the maneuvers, all their lies and their ideological warfare are
directed fundamentally against Cuba.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This does not mean that they do not wage
ideological warfare against China, that they do not try to influence in other ways. They
may avoid verbal attacks but they spread American culture to reach everywhere with their
cultural influence, consumer habits and other forms of penetration. They would like to
introduce into China the style and conceptions of the consumer society which would be
absolute madness. They can not act differently because those are the principles that
govern a capitalist economy and they do it in competition with other capitalist economies
that are also powerful. They sell a consumer model which, as we have said on other
occasions, is completely unsustainable, inconceivable for billions of people on Earth.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They will also continue trying to subvert
order in China. They will try, by more subtle methods, to impose the Western
society&#146;s criteria, concepts, ideas and style on those countries. Also against the
Vietnamese, they will not stop using those measures.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As for us, the idea is to overthrow the
Revolution and its ideals, to destroy the Revolution, crush the Revolution. Like we were
saying before, they are now fundamentally concentrating on the proclaimed, thoroughly
proclaimed programs of ideological warfare, via the famous Track II policy, and the
economic warfare. Two things: ideological and economic warfare. They want to suffocate the
country economically so they try to smother it, to weaken it, to create the optimum
conditions so that their rotten ideas can get in or can deceive with illusions a lot of
people who do not know, as that young man who spoke to us today knows, about the realities
of the world and the dominant system. That is why we have to constantly explain why they
have what they have and how they got it. You could also ask how much longer can last the
economic order they have imposed to the world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They themselves could be faring better.
Wealth could be better distributed there, more fairly, too. They have accumulated
technologies, science, industries, all the resources needed to produce in abundance.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The type of society they have developed is
disastrous for nature and it is disastrous for the world. They are consuming 25 % of world
energy every year. They are the ones who have most polluted the atmosphere and the seas,
who have contributed most to climatic changes and they are the ones who are most resisting
taking measures. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Europeans, the Japanese and all the
other countries show more willingness to take measures friendly to the environment. It is
the rulers of the United States who are the most resistant. They are the least concerned
at that. Actually. they can not be concerned, because the system does not let them be
seriously concerned at the tragedy. There, they work for capital, for profits, through
anarchic laws that can not be concerned with anything, neither the environment nor man. It
is simply what results from the chaotic development they engender.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But that is a country where there should
not be 43 million people without guaranteed medical services; a country where there should
not be such inequalities, so huge disparities in fortunes, where some have more than 50
billion dollars in wealth and other must sleep under bridges. That makes no sense. There
is no rhyme or reason to that while they have so many technical and material resources and
they have had great achievements in productivity, production and services. The
agricultural manual labor of picking tomatoes and vegetables is for immigrants from
Mexico, Haiti and other countries. That is no longer a job for Americans. It is a job of
foreign immigrants. Everything else is done with machines.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is essential to know all those realities
so that they can not deceive people. We must not forget imperialism and the imperialist
system, its origin in the developed capitalist system and where it is leading the world.
We have to make the necessary emphasis on this subject because it is leading, inevitably,
to great catastrophes.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All that is part of the ideological battle
and putting in everybody's mind the impossible illusion of a personal motor car. As I have
said on other occasions, I try to imagine China with a motor car in every family home. The
100 million hectares the Chinese have for growing food would not be enough for garages and
parking lots, highways and expressways. There would be no arable land left there. We hope
that, with the proverbial Chinese wisdom, they will meditate on all these things.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">India, is similar and so are Africa and
Latin America. That is one of the great tragedies they have. In places like Mexico City,
there is a large number of motor cars. The pollution they produce, along with the smoke
from industry, is physically unbearable. So, they have established some regulations. The
cars with odd-numbered license plates do not ride one day and those with even-numbered
plates do not ride the other day. What have those people with money done? They have bought
a second car, one for each day. They have no problem, except for endless traffic jams and
the same poisoned atmosphere.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The traffic difficulties in many big
cities, even in Tokyo, are awful. It takes three hours to get from one place to another.
They often can not use vehicles. They resort to the subway, which is expensive but fast.
There are cities that have grown disproportionately and they no longer tolerate that
lifestyle. All kinds of resources are tremendously depleted. It would be better to place
them at the service of humanity rather to waste them. They have invaded the Latin American
countries with such habits. I hope, therefore, that the Chinese do not give up the
bicycle, to which they owe so much.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As for us, from the 30,000 rides per bus
per day, we had to go back to the modest bicycle. We bought millions of them and we are
also manufacturing; we had to turn to the famous <i><b>&quot;camels&quot;</b></i> (lorries
converted to buses) and endure the hardships of a difficult situation with passenger
transport.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are developed countries like Holland,
for example, where everybody has a bicycle. A bicycle culture has been created, perhaps
due to greater awareness about the environment, physical health and exercise. They use
them on a mass scale, although they might have a car. I think the Dutch have 17 million
bicycles. And they have told me that, even there, there are those who steal bicycles. I do
not know if it is the simple bad habit of stealing or it is for amusement.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The imperialists talk about human rights
but they never talk about the truly human problems, about man within the very hegemonic
power and in the rest of the world. We, on the other hand, always talk a lot about human
things and do humane things that are a thousand times more humane than what those masters
of the world do for man.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They say that the market laws solve the
problems of man, of the sick; the problems of unemployment, poverty, hunger, lonely
forsaken people, abandoned children and all the others, this law accompanied, in their mad
conception, by the dreadful selfishness that those societies engender.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">These subjects need to be studied in depth.
They are related to the ideological battle that is so important and fundamental because
those are the weapons they mostly use to attack us now. They have a reserve in their
military forces but we do not know what they will do with them because the world can not
be ruled with nuclear weapons. It is impossible.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They have had serious problems in a country
as small as Somalia. Sticking their noses everywhere, they suffered a setback there. A
company was almost annihilated. That created such problems in the United States that they
had the wisdom to quickly pull out the troops from there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Their greatest hopes are with the great
supremacy they have over the mass media. They have great hopes in that and they have
enormous economic and technical resources for it. We have already talked about that too in
this Congress.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">These are subjects we need to think about
and the young people must think seriously about it all. You can not be irresponsible in
this day and age because big problems are in store for humanity just around the corner.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I would simply mention that, within 50
years, humanity will have 10 billion inhabitants while it can not cope with the six
billion it has now. Of those six billion, five billion live in the underdeveloped and poor
world and only around one billion live in developed countries. It does not mean that all
those who live in the developed countries are receiving the benefits of development. No,
there are great inequalities in wealth in those developed countries and millions, tens of
millions of unemployed, too. There are problems of every kind, but there are only one
billion living there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are also rich people in the
underdeveloped countries. They do not have any problems. There is a percentage who live as
if they were in Europe. From that point down is where the tragedy begins. That is to say,
the rich classes in the underdeveloped countries can have the average consumption level
they have in Europe.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Among the underdeveloped, there are those
with a higher level of development and others with a much lower level. Hence, the enormous
importance of that battle which, in our country, is the fight against all illegalities, I
repeat, against all kind of criminal activity.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is irritating, annoying, it corrupts and
it brings a rosary of problems that you all know, which you have fought against, are
fighting against and propose to fight against more and more, with increasingly efficient
methods a good part of which are, as I said, educational, persuasive, preventive methods.
It is a general struggle that must unite all forces, the really important force the
Revolution has created to wage such struggle at this time. I think those ideas are by now
very clear.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have attended the two plenary sessions
here, but we are familiar with debates in the commissions where, as we were told, around
120 delegates took part. Those must have been very rich debates. And here, in the plenary,
a total of 36 people spoke. Around 160 have been able to speak, so that I think the
organization is well informed and it will benefit a lot from this Congress; and not only
the organization but the country at large.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This must be circulated as much as
possible, in every CDR and among all the CDR members in the country. It is very important
that they become aware, that they have full information of the Congress and its results.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I do not think that I need to talk more on
this point. We have the another subject: the hurricane.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Some things were already said about that on
the opening day. We even had the opportunity to talk to you briefly about the history of
the CDRs. That spares me the need to do it here. Our problem now is not so much talking
about history as preserving history. It is not so much the past -- although that is very
important, really important, since that is where our roots are -- as the future struggle
that we must wage.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I also said something about the hurricane,
what it means morally and the satisfaction for the fact that we have been able to
simultaneously wage two such important battles on these two fronts. Of course, we are now
recovering from the consequences of the hurricane.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Broadly speaking I must say, now with all
the information, that the number of fatal victims -- and, when I spoke to you three days
ago, there were only four confirmed -- increased to six. Here are the names and causes:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A lady who needed to go out to the patio of
the house and died when she made contact with an electric wire. You can not speak of
carelessness in this case.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Another who died while crossing a road on a
motorbike under the hurricane. He was a combatant. There was a hot wire that the winds had
thrown to the road... He was not out socializing, as I told you, he was doing some work
and he died.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is another who died while trying to
tie an electric wire next to his house. The electricity took him by surprise. It did not
electrocute him, but he fell in the River Simborrio and drowned, in the municipality of
Yara. This fellow countryman died in that effort. He must have been in great need and it
is in that kind of accident that he passed away.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is another death. This was at the
Tercer Frente (Third Front) municipality, in Santiago de Cuba. He was found drowned in the
Salto del Chivo crossing, in the same municipality, on 25 September 1998. It has not been
possible to determine how it happened.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is this other case, which I already
mentioned the first day, who died in a dam, where he had been working. He was a water
resources worker who was out there. In this case, I had said that he died while doing a
job but it seems, really, that he was careless while on his way home. I had mentioned him
as a worker under the hurricane. According to what they tell us now, he tried to cross to
the other side of the dam and the accident happened on the dam levee. Apparently, he did
not notice that the dam was overflowing and the water swept him away. That is the fifth
case.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The sixth, in the municipality of Buey
Arriba, Granma province, drowned while trying to cross on horseback the already flooded
River Buey, in Yara, on 26 September 1998. We were informed of this case last night.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They are six, whose names I will mention,
to express condolences to the families, on behalf of all of you and all of us. They are:
Elvia Matos Reyes, 61 years old; Amaury Reyes Mojena, 60 years old, he is the one who died
on the motorbike, a former combatant of the Revolution; Jorge Vega Guillén, aged 42;
Rafael Mojena Arteaga, aged 60; Israel González Chacón, aged 58; and Lorenzo Fiss
Ramírez, aged 33.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Regrettably, they are the victims reported
up to now. The possibility exists that other cases might still appear, although I see it
as less probable with all the data that we now have, all the communications re-established
and all the places checked.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are no children and let's say that
the youngest is 33 years old. No child, no adolescent, no young person under 30 years old
has died because of the hurricane.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It was mainly agriculture that was
affected, certainly. Crops were affected substantially by the hurricane in its course
through 13 provinces, out of the 14 in the country, where the hurricane passed through,
including Havana province and the capital city, although it was rains more than winds over
these two and on a smaller scale, really.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">These provinces produced 95% of the
country's plantains. Those plantations occupy 94% of the total crop area for that product
nationwide but, fortunately, the damage was less in Havana province, the supplier of this
city of over two million people.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The best plantations suffered the most,
those set up with the microjet irrigation system. The ones with the highest investment and
production were seriously affected, to different extents, with those in Guantánamo the
most affected of all.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Coffee and cacao were also badly affected,
in the first place Guantánamo, Santiago de Cuba, Granma and Holguin, which are the main
producers.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The roads sustained great damages. Among
those reported, 344 kilometers affected in Guantánamo and 162 in Granma. The rest of the
territory is still being checked.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Other green and root vegetables: a lot of
cassava plantations flooded. Except in Guatánamo and Holguin, all the provinces report
cassava plantations under water. Work is being done to drain the fields and recover what
is possible. An important part of this production will not be useful for human
consumption.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Also the plantations of early cabbage
although, fortunately, we were not deep into the planting season. Vegetables seedbeds have
been lost but there are seeds for replanting.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Rice suffered quite a lot, not the rice
kept in silos and warehouses. What was affected was the ripe rice that can not be
harvested due to the fields flooding and humidity. There are 105,000 quintals in Pinar del
Rio waiting to be harvested. There was not so much rain there. There is a smaller number
of flooded <i>caballerías</i>. [One <i>caballería</i>, 13.43 hectares.]</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The worst-affected rice-producing area is
that of Granma, which has some 200,000 quintals of rice ready to seed and ripe, still to
be harvested.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Tobacco. The tobacco harvested and stored
from the last campaign was not affected. It was timely protected. But in practically every
province seedbeds were affected. There is tobacco, as you all know, in Sancti Spiritus, in
Villa Clara and elsewhere. But the seedbeds can be recovered and do not constitute a
problem to emphasize about tobacco, in general.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Citrus fruits did not suffer like with
hurricane Lili. At the Victoria de Giron enterprise in Jagüey Grande, Matanzas, there was
no significant damage. In Ciego de Avila, they report losses of several thousand tons of
grapefruit. The estimate is 2,500 tons of citrus fruit in Ceballos and 1,000 in Morón.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Seven hundred and ninety-six tons of
oranges, 400 tons of lemons and a similar quantity of tangerine were affected.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Camagüey also reports 2,095 tons of
grapefruit affected in the Sola plantations.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As for forestry, the number of trees blown
down by the winds onto the coffee is considered high, with a substantial number too on
mountain roads and paths, in all the provinces affected. The number of cubic meters of
timber lost is not known yet.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is considered that approximately 80% of
the honey potential is affected, mainly due to the passing of the hurricane at the time of
the kindling reed flowers, which have been damaged appreciably. This is another export
item.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is regarding agriculture, in general.
The data related to the sugar-cane plantations still has not been accurately compiled.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is no significant damage reported to
the cattle population. No animals loss.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">No stores of fodder were lost either. There
was damage to the roofs of installations, which were repaired immediately. The raw
materials for fodder were protected, they were not affected. Production has been paralyzed
for lack of electric energy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are no difficulties with medicines,
there being reserves in every territory to face any contingency.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">No significant damage is reported in pig
breeding.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">No losses are reported of pesticides, raw
materials for fodder, raw materials for fertilizer and stored seeds.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Here is the report of the measures taken
but I am not going to talk about that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Efforts, and other damages and losses
caused by Hurricane Georges, according to preliminary information sent by the provinces,
are as follows: 494,124 people evacuated. Of these, 202,513 were given shelter, and
237,991 students were evacuated.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If both figures are added, that makes
around 700,000 people evacuated. There is not a single case of a child, adolescent or
young person who suffered any harm.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Some 705,600 animals of different species
were moved to safe places.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Some 40,079 houses were damaged, 2,100 of
them totally destroyed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Almost 400 economic facilities were partly
affected, 144 of them agricultural facilities.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A hundred and thirteen schools were
damaged.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Some 104,935 people were mobilized to
implement the protection programs and 8,676 means of transportation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The dead, although they are mentioned here,
I have already referred to them at the beginning.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The data on damage to bridges and roads is
being determined exactly by the territories. There is still some data to be determined but
we hope they are problems that can be solved.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Communications, in general, are being
re-established. The most important bridge in the Santiago-Guantánamo railroad, made of
steel and concrete, was ripped out and dragged along by the river. That is going to have
Guantánamo cut off by that route. The bridge must be rebuilt quickly but it takes time
and 60% of the goods that reach Guantánamo are transported by that way. This means
transportation by other, more expensive means while the bridge is rebuilt..</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The problem with this hurricane regarding
farm production is that it came along with the end of the harshest drought the Revolution
has known and that nobody had known up to now in Cuba -- the most severe drought of all
time. It caused damage everywhere. It caused damage in rice production, of course. The
dams, as you could all see, were almost all empty. The water had to be transported in
trucks to many cities at a high cost. On top of this drought which damaged agricultural
production throughout the country, there came the hurricane, with the damages that I have
explained, but mainly in plantains and other food crops which are part of our population
basic diet, in the city and in the countryside.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">One demonstration of how the drought
affected the production of beans is that, in the capital's agricultural market where, some
time ago, a pound of beans cost six pesos, it now costs 12, 13, 14 pesos. That is as a
consequence of the drought. Also, as a consequence of the drought, root-vegetable
production was affected in the different provinces, but where it caused tremendous damage
was in Las Tunas, Holguin and three municipalities in Guantánamo. The drought was very
serious. It has affected agriculture and sugar cane. When it affects sugar cane, the
damage is always considerable because it is an export item, an industry where significant
investment and expenditure are made every year in order to ensure a certain harvest.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, the hurricane lowers production.
It deprives the country of X amount of sugar, we still can not say how much. We have to
quantify it well and watch for the weather in case new rains fall and sowing can take
place. The sowing now is with a view to the 1999-2000 sugar harvest. That is important. We
have to do things right. We now have to wait for the fields to be proper to be able to
plant that cane. There is water, there is humidity, but too much.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is damage by another route, is it not?
Although the cane also means honey for rum production. Of course, rum will be given
priority. It also means honey for the production of alcohol, honey for feeding livestock
and other uses. That is indirect but significant damage.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have not mentioned the sugar harvest
here. I do want to explain some things well. This creates a complicated situation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I already explained to you that we had
undertaken efforts to compensate for the drought. Yes, there was no hesitation as soon as
the situation was assessed in Holguin, Las Tunas and some other places. Actually, we
concentrated in those places with the most critical situations. The decision was made to
incur an expense, relatively high in our case, to provide a food supplement for those two
entire provinces, that is, a supplementary food quota for the two complete provinces and
the three most critical municipalities in Guantanamo.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I will give you the information. It was
agreed, for example, to double their bread ration. That involves certain quantities of
flour that are needed immediately. The implementation of this plan began in the very month
of September. Bread was included, despite the complications derived from the industrial
process, transportation and distribution. But, as production is organized in the cities
and in the countryside, their ration was doubled and what was needed was acquired to do
this for four months.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There was no hurricane and beans and other
autumn crops were being sown. There was no threatening hurricane and the decision was
made. I am even going to point out to you -- it is not a very large amount but I think it
means something -- about the bread, which was doubled for them; the delivery of an extra
kilogram of rice, an extra kilogram of peas -- and I am going to talk about that too,
explain something to you -- half a pound of cooking oil, approximately a quarter liter per
capita a month, already purchased for that purpose. When the costs were incurred with that
aim, we were not counting on the hurricane.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, on top of the drought came the
hurricane. We had hoped that the people in Holguin, Las Tunas and Guantánamo could begin
recovering with some fresh rain falling. A little rain had already fallen before the
hurricane in those provinces. There were some red marks of more than 30 millimeters in
some places. The plantain under microjet irrigation, the safest production, was terribly
affected. It suffered considerable damage. We can not say that it was totally destroyed.
You can always use something. But the strong winds affected it very, very badly. We know
from experience here in the capital how long it takes one of those plants to recover
because even those leaves that do not fall are left very damaged.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Holguin is a plantain producing province
and that is its main staple. They had grown those crops with microjet, which yields 10, 12
or 14 times higher than the others. But they traditionally have a lot of <i>caballerías</i>
of plantains in non irrigated areas. Everybody grows plantain there. Also in Las Tunas, in
Camagüey, everywhere they grow plantains with and without irrigation. And the plantain
was struck a blow everywhere, in addition to the other things that I pointed out to you
before.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It was necessary to find a quick food
response to the hurricane situation. In this case, of course, it is more expensive than
the response I described associated to the assistance for 1,600,000 people. This is the
exact data; nothing more, nothing less.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our resources are scarce but there was no
hesitation. As I told you all, we had a meeting on Friday. Upon conclusion of the opening
session with you, I returned to my office and we met to analyze two things in detail:
first, the damage to housing, facilities, everything concerning damages. There, we learned
about 40,000 houses affected, not destroyed and 2,100 totally destroyed in different and
distant places. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Second, to analyze every aspect, that is,
how much material we have in the reserves -- because we always keep some reserves at hand
-- zinc and asbestos roof tiles, guttering, everything; how much wood we have, how many
tons of nails, painting materials, everything that might be needed to repair or build a
house in emergency cases. Also, if somebody lost a refrigerator, how many we have in
reserve where a number have always been kept for these situations; if some television sets
have been lost, some of those things; mattresses, for example, something that is
important.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I can say, for example, that the news
reached us today that, in San Nicolas de Bari, Havana province, something similar to what
happened in Mayari occurred there on Friday. Three hundred millimeters of rain had fallen
in a town where there had never been floods and nobody was evacuated. There was a
tremendously heavy rainfall. People were on the roofs of the houses. Only a few homes were
not flooded. I do not know the population of that little town of San Nicolás de Bari. One
of you should know. (They tell him 21,000 people) Twenty-one thousand¼ quite a few. And
all the organized forces went there immediately and they evacuated everybody who had to be
evacuated in those circumstances, without an accident, nobody drowned.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The water was at roof level in most of the
town and there suddenly went a stream, a small river whose sources had received the 300
millimeters in a very short time. It was the case of Mayarí only this time in San
Nicolás de Bari. We know that they lost 300 mattresses. The comrade Minister of Domestic
Trade has been there since yesterday &#150; she manages certain supplies -- in order to
organize the immediate delivery of 300 mattresses to ensure replacement of those
definitely lost and the repair of all the others affected.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">These products are sold to those affected
but they are sold at reduced prices, the traditional minimum prices, oftentimes
subsidized. If they do not have enough money, they are granted with the necessary payment
facilities.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How many were lost in Mayarí? How many
were lost in Sagua? How many were lost in other places? In Havana province, San Nicolás
was not the only place. There is another town in the same province, Aguacate. How many
things were under the water there? (They tell him that some 110 houses were under water,
but that the water level fell more quickly and there was less damage.) How many mattresses
were lost there? (They answer that none were lost there.) We all have to learn to be very
honest when reporting losses.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There were losses of that kind in almost
every province. It is still not known with absolute precision. But we know what we have
and the raw material available to make some mattresses. Sometimes, really, people do not
like them, but the foam-rubber mattresses are the best, the most comfortable and
long-lasting. They are also what we have. The others are of cotton padding and other
materials and there is not the same production capacity. We know the capacity that we have
for producing mattresses and other essential items.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Look, it happens that there is a joint
venture for the production of this line, people who brought the technology and some
equipment. They supply the raw material and do so quickly. We are partners and the
arrangement we have signed for these cases is that they provide us at cost price. But, of
course, it is an expense and what is used up from the reserve of materials needs to be
replaced. Everything, each of these things, was analyzed and they are being distributed
quickly to the provinces.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Two commissions set out today to accurately
assess the damage. But we said: Do not wait for the commissions. The commissions go
because it is essential to visit the affected areas and determine the damage. But we are
not waiting until the commissions come back. We are starting to send the resources that
can be used immediately. We are not waiting a single day. The commissions should assess
the total damage and do so with precision. They are made up of ministers and deputy
ministers and chaired by an experienced cadre to visit the different places. It is not
about solving old problems, of which there are many, but the new ones that have been
created by the hurricane. Those basic products are immediately available as was the case
in Cienfuegos, in Villa Clara and in all those places hit by hurricane Lili two years ago.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We must also take into account that the
hurricane season is far from being over. Nobody can be sure that another hurricane will
not come. So, at the same time we are using up a certain amount of something, we have to
be acquiring more to replace it. Keeping a reserve, at least at the level we have it at
the moment, requires expenditure in cash and in hard currency for all these materials. I
am talking to you, comrades, about expenses in cash and in hard currency, because the
first thing is to have the materials in hand, then there should be no problem in getting
them everywhere quickly!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All the construction brigades are organized
and already working. As it stopped raining, they started working. That is the importance
of being organized. That is also the significance of the national property or the control
and close cooperation of the basic means of production, transportation, trains and
factories, to provide an immediate response to any critical situation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">For example, the zinc roof tiles were there
in Las Tunas. There is quite an amount of raw material available and the production
capacity is well known because what they had produced for the reserve, before the
hurricane, was taking up almost all the space, so that, now that the raw material is
available they should quickly begin to produce gutter tiles. The production and supplies
go faster then that the time it takes to use them. With those things, they do not have to
wait for one minute to start doing the repairs and building. These are the measures taken
with regards to material damages.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As for of emergency food requirements, I
have already explained to you the needs caused by the drought. Now come those caused by
the hurricane, took a pleasure tour of 900 kilometers, from Maisí up to the point from
where it went into the sea, including the influx of strong rains and winds on Varadero.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How far is it from Maisí Point to Hicacos
Point? It went from point to point, a large part through the territory. Winds of over 100
kilometers an hour speed blew in Varadero and, here in the capital, some blew with a
certain force. Heavy rains fell in some areas of the Havana provinces located in zones
comprised within the 900 kilometers of direct hurricane influence, where also strong winds
blew or rains fell abundantly for three days.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Fortunately, the area of the Malecón
waterfront was less affected, because damage is always costly there. The amount of sea
water that seeped in was relatively small, with little damage, because, although it passed
over the wall and seeped into the city a few blocks in some places, winds then came from
the south and slowed down the undertow. We have been lucky that the sea water seeping was
relatively small in the north of the city and the winds did not destroy the plantain and
banana crops in Havana. From 5% to 10 % must have been affected, but it did not destroy
the plantations in that province.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So measures now have to be taken. What are
we to do, considering what happened throughout the country due to the drought? Because
those measures related to the drought were taken in the most critical places and without
hurricanes and, since then, it had begun raining in the rest of the country and the people
were preparing to sow crops, vegetables, beans and all before the hurricane.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We then analyzed well what we had to do in
this situation and the decisions made were as follows:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">To keep up the plan for Las Tunas, Holguin
and the three municipalities in Guantánamo, what is delivered to them and in the amounts
is delivered to them, according to the program foreseen for four months.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, apart from that, something common to
all was arranged for every province, from Matanzas to Maisí. We did not measure who
suffered more or less, in every hectare of land. Sancti Spiritus, for example, suffered a
bit less, but we are not going to apply a program and leave out Sancti Spíritus. It would
be very confusing now to make a mathematical calculation, if somebody is given a pound,
one-and-a-half pounds, and somebody else two pounds. We calculated an immediate supplement
for everybody.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">An extra kilogram of grains per person,
peas, for all citizens. This means that if, in one household, there are six or seven, that
means six or seven extra kilograms a month, for three months -- October, November and
December -- from Matanzas to Guantánamo and that is in addition to the quota that
Holguin, Las Tunas and those three municipalities are receiving. That is an addition to
the previous aid. What you give, you can not take back. (Laughter.) They are given
something else taking into account that they were more badly affected than others by the
drought, then again badly affected by the hurricane, the rains and all that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Look, they are not big figures but it will
not be only that either. For the whole population of those provinces, from Matanzas to
Guantánamo, one kilogram a month per capita for three months means around 22,000 tons.
That is already here. But something else will be done, this time selectively and
throughout the country. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We analyzed how many children there are in
the country under 14 years old. This distribution is a bit selective, but our people will
certainly understand it. All children up to 14 years, no exceptions can be made here. It
has to be for all of them. There are households that have more resources and can go to
buy, almost at any price, in the agricultural market or in some shops, some things. But,
here, no distinction of any kind can be made. When it is for children, it is for all
children and there can be no distinction. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All the children in the country under 14
and all people aged 60 years and upward will be provided an additional supply! Do you know
how many people there are in this country who are over 60 years old? I do not have the
exact figure now, but it is about 1,300,000. The result of the health programs, the
increase in life expectancy. Around 1,300,000!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">José Luis, could you say exactly? You were
at the meeting. (José Luis Rodríguez, Minister for Economics and Planning, answers that
there are 1,460,000.) Well, there are more than I had thought. I am really glad. It is
surprising, is it not? Well, now you know. There are people with good incomes who do not
remember their little old lady and, if they can then send her to elders home. It is not
bad, they are quite well in the home. But, well, such things happen.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All of them for 10 months will receive that
assistance until agriculture recovers. That was the estimate we made, 10 months. That is,
all children up to 14 years and all people aged 60 years and more are going to receive an
additional quota for 10 months.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What does it consist of? One kilogram of
rice, that is something, one kilogram of peas, I have come back to peas and I said that we
were going to talk about that. Incidentally, people from those age groups in the eastern
provinces will receive an extra one-and-a-half kilograms because they were affected most
by the drought and the hurricane. So, these people in that area will receive an extra
two-and-a-half kilograms of grains, that is, in all the eastern provinces. I repeat: one
kilogram of rice, one kilogram of peas -- they can cook rice with peas, soup with a little
bit of rice -- and a quarter liter of cooking oil for 10 months. They make up more than
3,900,000 people, about four million people children up to 14 and adults over 60 years of
age.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Can we do anything more equitable, anything
fairer, if we do not have enough resources? Well, every family has a child, a grandchild
or a grandmother. Of course, what the grandmothers generally do is protect the children.
Those who are least protected are elderly people. Aside from psychology and habit, there
is a certain logic in protecting the young. These products, I repeat, will be distributed
for 10 months. Is all of this clear? At the subsidized prices of the ration card.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If it were to be paid at the dollar-peso
exchange rate, the price would have to be at least 20 times higher. But, no, it is not a
matter of putting the prices on the same level as the price of the dollar in the exchange
bureaus where it is 20 to 1. The prices I am referring to are in national currency, at the
normal subsidized prices of the ration card. That is called Revolution! (Applause.)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I want to continue elaborating on this
point. Of course, we will have to work hard for an agricultural recovery.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, on account of the hurricane and the
drought we are talking 146,000 tons of grains and approximately 10,000 tons of cooking
oil.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Each of these products has a price and,
really, one of the most expensive at the moment is rice. The price of rice is climbing
like mad. Nevertheless, not only were grains considered but a certain amount of rice, as
during the drought there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This makes up approximately 156,000 tons of
food including the cooking oil, of these, 146,000 tons are of grains and I am including
the flour for bread that is being given out in Holguin, Las Tunas and in those
municipalities in Guantánamo. Add that up. And some prices are high, others not so high.
The highest is the price of rice and there is the risk of the price rising.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This will be for of the next three months.
The extra quota for children and the elderly over 60 will last for 10 months.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are two things to bear in mind: none
of what is added will take anything away from the previous amounts. Everybody can figure
it out according to what we have explained. The people of Holguin, Las Tunas and elsewhere
will continue to receive what they were receiving their bread and things, plus the extra
kilogram, which will be given out from Matanzas to Guantánamo for three months. And, on
top of that, children and the elderly their extra quota for 10 months, which will be given
throughout the country. (Applause.)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The country is now making efforts to try to
increase the production of yogurt. Children are will adapted to soya yogurt.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Let's see, we have to study all of this,
but these were some of the things that I wanted to talk to you about today and the
resources had to be at hand.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Each province should do its own
calculations. Everybody in Holguin, for example, must do their own calculations. We hope
that in Velasco and other similar places throughout the country, people will be collecting
their beans and other crops by the month of January, if there are no more hurricanes come,
right? If more hurricanes come, we will have to come up with new ideas.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">These resources that I have mentioned are
already on their way. We are not leaving anything till later. To begin with, as early as
Friday, instructions were given to start transferring what we had in hand, and also
purchasing more. In some cases, we had anticipated and they had been negotiated before the
hurricane. But we are talking about some tens of millions disbursement in convertible
currency and dollars to include everything: the hurricane, the drought, materials for
repairs and other things. What we have in hand today must be replaced immediately, and
other things that can be added.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As I told you, no one hesitated, even
though this could mean shelving certain important investments for the country's
development. Of course, some are given priority in relation to others.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You all know that a hotel produces hard
currency, employment and other things. But, well, we are looking at new ways and we are
striving for greater efficiency. We are not going to halt our development plans either.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But we could not sit back and wait for help
from abroad. We have experienced with that. We applied for a credit for food products from
certain countries with abundant resources at the time of Hurricane Lili and there was no
cooperation whatsoever, except for some modest donations. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As I was telling you the other day, there
are many disasters in the world. Condolences and solidarity telegrams abound. Of course,
many who send sincere messages do not have resources to help. I will never forget that a
country with such scarce resources as Jamaica sent us 50,000 dollars at the time of
Hurricane Lili something deeply moving. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are thankful for every message of
solidarity that we receive, from wherever it might come. Some countries with more
resources send donations, spontaneously, without being asked. Some contributions are given
but in quantities that do not compare with the great efforts, the sacrifices and
expenditures the country makes in such situations. Cuba, under an economic blockade for
almost 40 years, has never received a single penny from the international financial
organizations. The United States forbids it. We have learned how to struggle alone against
natural disasters.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When Hurricane Lili hit us badly, causing
considerable loss and great damage to exports too, the bulk of the resources were
purchased by the country in free convertible currency and other valuable resources.
Undoubtedly, under these exceptional circumstances of two natural disasters -- a drought
and a hurricane --, it was much more important that the essential aid available was
immediately taken to the people, who have behaved so gallantly, waging their battle in
such an exemplary way. This could at least be proof of the efforts the country is willing
to make even under the conditions of the special period, with resources taken from the
heart of our own economy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have had some bitter experiences. I have
already told you about them. I mentioned on television -- I think it was at the National
Weather Bureau -the experience we had with some aid, which certain non-governmental
organizations and some friendly people offered to send from Florida and which we only
accepted out of courtesy, so as not to offend anyone. The counterrevolutionary mafia
interfered and sabotaged the deliveries, mixing the goods with the dirty poison of
annexationist and unpatriotic propaganda. Of course, that is not the attitude of many
Americans of Cuban origin. People like Lucius Walker and other institutions in the United
States send aid that is highly appreciated by our people because it is sincere, valiant
and noble.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Some American spokesmen certainly say
shameful things. When Robertico [Roberto Robaina] spoke at the United Nations, an American
delegate presented a reply the following day. Robertico immediately gave a counter-reply,
very good and concise. That American delegate's reply could have lasted, between 5 and 10
minutes and Robertico's around six minutes. He said quite a few additional truths there.
The American delegate replied again, something that had not been seen at the United
Nations in a long time, and Robertico counter-replied again for some four or five minutes.
Certainly very good, although it does not have the same effect that a speech given there
in Cuba's name, which has more impact.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But, do you know one of the things that the
U.S. delegation said? That Americans had sent to Cuba about two billion dollars in
humanitarian aid in the last few years. His exact statement was as follows: &quot;Since
1992, the United States has authorized more than two billion dollars in private
humanitarian aid to Cuba.&quot; Come on, gentlemen! Are they out of their minds? </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They must have even included Lucius
Walker's donations, the ones that were stopped there, which forced them to go on a hunger
strike and wage heroic battles. And, what do you think about the alleged permits that the
government publicly declared it would grant and licenses to import some medicines,
including some that Robertico mentioned at the United Nations? No, none of that has come
yet. But, I should correct myself, if I am wrong. I would ask Minister Dotres to correct
me. (Carlos Dotres, Minister of Public Health, says that none has arrived.) None has
arrived. And how long has it been since they made those statements? If I remember
correctly, I was in Geneva. (Dotres says that we filed a request to 10 companies about
three months before.) We filed a request to 10 firms and no medicine has arrived. (Dotres
says that some of the companies have since declined.)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As soon as they issued the statement, we
put them to the test. We said: Let's see, Dotres. Which are the main items, the
fundamental items among the things that we have to obtain by certain means or some that
can not be obtained by any means. Three months have passed and not a single pill has
arrived in this country. This is to give you an idea of their lack of integrity. They say
that U.S. citizens have contributed two billion dollars in humanitarian aid. Let them
speak the truth, let them come up with the figures so we can know what multiplication
factor they used.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Let's see, Dotres, since this is your
field, do you have any idea of the amount of humanitarian aid in terms of medicine that
has been received from that country? (Dotres answers that some aid came from
non-governmental organizations, which does not even amount to 1% of that figure, not even
to 20 million dollars.) In other words, it does not even come to 20 million. Is that so?
Why do we not write it down clearly, the whole sum? How can they include what they have
been banning as humanitarian aid when there was even a hunger strike, that lasted I do not
know how many days, so the medicines could be brought in? Then they take a stand at the
United Nations to say that U.S. citizens have sent around two billion dollars in
humanitarian aid.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Two billion dollars! Our Minister of Public
Health here can show the lists of everything that has arrived, and giving it the usual
price, or even the commercial price, it will not amount to that figure. They have
exaggerated by one hundred times. They have multiplied by one hundred. How about that!
That is what they said at the United Nations. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Even family remittances were banned for a
good part of those years. Millions of people throughout the world send remittances to
their families from the United States, from Europe, from the oil-producing countries, from
South Africa, from Malaysia, from any country where immigrants work. And never before, in
any part of the world, has that been considered humanitarian aid. It would be an offense
to those who send remittances and to the wives, children, parents, brothers and sisters
who receive them. Practically every Third World country receives remittances sent to their
families by migrant workers in developed countries. There are also family remittances
between developed countries. If they mean that, it is disgraceful. The dictionary cannot
be changed just like that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A small message will have to be sent there,
with the figures and it will have to be sent to every UN delegate because Robertico does
not have that information there. It is not there. But, with respect to that paragraph, we
have to send a message and dispatch the list, and the denial, to the Pan-American Health
Office (PAHO), to the WHO and to all the ambassadors in the United Nations. It is worth
the trouble. We cannot stand idly by, they must be exposed. Also, because they deceived
the world when they declared more than three months ago that they would authorize the
export of medicines to Cuba.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">However, we are very grateful to those
Americans or U.S. organizations that, in good faith and honestly, have sent medicines to
Cuba. We do not measure a gesture by the volume of what is sent to us. We measure it by
the goodwill with which it is sent, the spirit of solidarity in which it is done. This is
how we measure it, and we thank them. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them.
(Applause.) I wish Dotres were mistaken and it was 15 million, 20 million during the years
of the special period. Let's hope so! I once asked the minister to calculate the amount,
because I had already read similar statements. That does not totally surprise us.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is aid, yes, from different
countries. But when does it arrive? Long after our people have run out of the plantains
that they collected when they were toppled by the winds? Well, it would be worse if we
received nothing at all. Of course, it would not be much, but it is something, especially
a noble gesture of goodwill.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A United Nations agency offered us help to
compensate for the drought, the World Food Program, which is presently chaired by an
American lady who visited us not long ago. As a UN official, she showed interest in
organizing some kind of aid, but there was a problem: part of the aid would have to be
labeled as a donation from the U.S. government. We replied that we would not receive that
part. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You all know that during the Pope&#146;s
visit, he criticized the economic blockade in his farewell address, then Messrs. Helms and
Burton... -- Him over there is putting words in my mouth. (He refers to a delegate who
earlier called out something.) But, for this more solemn occasion, I will correctly say
the name of the latter, Burton, that is depending on how you pronounce it.
(&quot;Burton&quot; sounds in Spanish like &quot;burro&quot;, meaning &quot;idiot&quot;.)
I will use the other description, which is the one you could rightly use and with all good
reason to describe that law. The authors of that notorious genocide law immediately began
to maneuver in order to sabotage a motion in the U.S. Senate and the House of
Representatives to lift the blockade for exports of food and medicines. They were
desperately trying to fabricate an alleged humanitarian aid, which would also come with
strings attached, while keeping the economic blockade rigorously in place.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We immediately declared that we would not
accept that humiliating and dishonest aid, even without conditions. What we demand is the
end of the blockade and, if the blockade ends, we will not need humanitarian aid
(Applause) from the government that has blockaded us for nearly 40 years, that wages
economic warfare against us and that uses against us all its influence in the world, which
is greater than ever before, like its power that is also greater than ever.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Are they going to stick a knife in our back
while pretending to be a humanitarian government, sending some amounts of food nobody
knows for sure? But regardless of the amounts, what about the blockade? What about it?
What about the honor and the moral values of this country and the long struggle that it is
waging against the criminal blockade? That struggle is gaining ground, winning support and
sympathizers, and we see more every day, even among American businessmen.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Recently, over 100 American businessmen
wanted to visit Cuba. Some of them organized a visit. They were going to be here for 24
hours, because they were told that they could not spend a single penny. Well, we were
willing to put them up in a good hotel so that they would not spend even a penny, since it
was not their fault. Oh! But, no, non of that. If anything, come from Cancun and go back
the same day. Later, they were told quite simply that they could not do that either and
they were banned from coming. Some comrades, [Ricardo] Alarcón, who was going on a trip
to a meeting in Central America, and another comrade, had to go there to speak with the
American businessmen who want to trade with Cuba and, by the way, some represented very
important companies. They did not receive permission to come.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">On this subject, too, a university that
usually organizes trips abroad for its students, requested that we receive a few hundreds
of their students. Answer: Yes. They are students. They simply do not have the right to
deprive them of the chance to get to know another country. It is a prestigious,
distinguished university and, curiously enough, they have received permission. I do not
know, Otto [Rivero], if those people think that, by coming, they will soften us up or
indoctrinate the Cuban students and youth.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I do not know what element might have
determined that they did not give the businessmen permission, they multiplied the
medicines by one hundred or two hundred and, on the other hand, they authorize, according
to what we have been told, the students from the university, a distinguished university. I
am not calling into question the attitude of the American students, far from it. Our
students have maintained ties with American students and there are many issues to talk
about with those young students. I think that they are 700. I do not know how long they
will be here, one day or two, I do not know. But we told them, yes, let the students come.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Have they suddenly turned good in the State
Department? Are they not afraid? I do not know what the prevailing criterion might be.
Perhaps they believe that it fits with the Track II policy. Well, let the students come
and get to know the country. Yes, let them come. So, what? Did the world come to an end
when 3,000 journalists came here for the Pope's visit? And they poked their noses in
everywhere. They were truly able to cover everything. They knew almost as much as you do
because many things were organized by some people here for them, reporters from TV, radio,
the printed press, everything. Nothing happened, the world did not come to an end.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are delighted! Welcome the 700 students!
I hope that you will receive them and organize a program including whatever is of interest
to them from the monument to the <b>Maine</b> victims, up to the ships from Cervera's
squadron, which were sank off the coast of Santiago de Cuba, if that is of interest to
them. I imagine that different subjects will interest them. But, I am sure that, when you
talk with them, you will have a wide arsenal of topics to talk about with the US students,
with all due respect, with complete courtesy, while avoiding to insult their country in
the least.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of significant interest to us: the analysis
of important current problems, by using arguments. Our arguments are so sound that they
are irrefutable. Among those young people, there must be many with good qualities, who
come in good faith, who have no other information but what they receive one way or
another, which is seldom reliable.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Another proposal made to us was a meeting
of important newspapers and magazines. We told them: Yes, let them come too. Many of those
publications have criticized the blockade policy, many but not all. Some seem hostile but
we are not afraid. So, we have no objection. But, they did not let the businessmen come.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is, they use every measure, against
us, all resources, a relentless political, ideological and economic warfare, all sorts of
lies, like the ones I told you about. But, you are well informed, as well as the rest of
the people and our fellow countrymen who, in Guantánamo and other places, have
electricity tonight and can watch this event on television.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Suffice it to say that the measures we have
taken constitute a significant sacrifice for the plans that we are developing aimed at
overcoming our current difficulties. But, at the moment, the priority is looking after the
population.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was talking about aid. Well, promises
have been made. I spoke about this when I mentioned the constructive action of the
American lady who chairs the World Food Program. She was looking for 20 million dollars, a
figure that indicates a sincere effort at cooperation on the part of an agency that is
faced with a large number of requests. It was her idea, 20 million dollars to help the
country compensate for the drought. But, as I told you and as I explained at quite some
length, there was the problem that the United States government, through the WFP, is
offering part of this aid, but clearly registering its origin as a US donation. And we
replied: No, please. Let this UN agency do what it can, gather what it can, seek for funds
wherever it wants to seek for them, but we will not accept any kind of marked aid from the
United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Those UN agencies collect funds from
different sources but, of course, we said, that we would not accept the part of the aid,
in that 20 million dollar program, coming from the U.S. government as a donation to Cuba.
They are still working. They are still doing what they can to gather resources and to
assist Cuba.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The FAO is another UN agency that,
throughout the years, has made noble and generous contributions of food to Cuba. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Other countries have talked about a certain
amount of aid. I understand that Spain spontaneously offered a million dollars. Other
counties have also offered us some aid, 100,000 dollars, for example. And, still others
might offer us a certain cooperation. But, we know that, at the moment, we will have to
resolve the consequences of the enormous damage caused by an intense and prolonged drought
plus a hurricane that went right through the country, basically with our own resources, as
we said that day. We will seek out solutions to it. Whatever the force of that hurricane
and the damage it caused. We will face it with our own forces and sacrifice what needs to
be sacrificed. All the assistance that we might receive from abroad will be distributed
free of charge, in addition to the aid that we have decided to purchase on our own, modest
aid, but not without sacrifice.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have even said that we prefer that they
give priority to the Dominican Republic and Haiti, brother countries that have been
gravely affected. I would like to say something about this.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The hurricane hit the Dominican Republic
terribly hard because it got there with the full force of its 200 kilometers per hour
winds and it crossed the republic by the middle, with a colossal mass of water,
overflowing rivers, tremendous damage. Up until two days ago, only the capital had
electric energy. The rest of the country was without electricity. According to reports we
have received, it will be at least 10 to12 days before they can re-establish it. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The destruction of the electricity and
communication networks, roads, housing and agriculture was quite extensive. There were
sustained winds of 200 kilometers per hour. The damage must have been devastating; a large
number of victims, I do not remember now. It was reckoned 200. A number of missing people,
no less than 100. And, it is highly probable that, as they restore the communications,
they will discover an even higher number of human victims. They estimate the economic
damages at 1.2 billion dollars.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is hardly any news about Haiti. It
has not been possible to establish communications with Haiti. Not even the Dominican
Republic's government has been able to establish communications with Haiti. I say this
because I talked with the president of the Dominican Republic two days ago. We talked. He
was concerned about our situation. We explained everything to him and, he explained to us
fully about all the damage suffered, the situation they have.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am not going to go into details here
about the conversation, which was quite interesting, in my opinion, although I am sure our
neighbors up there have it recorded. That is for sure. There is not a telephone call from
here that they do not pick up. They spend many billions on that every year. But, well, I
must be discreet about what we talked, the usual things in such a situation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They had approached us, asking for some
cooperation. But, well, I first want to conclude what I was saying. The hurricane did a
lot of damage there. The damage that it must have done in Haiti too is incalculable. What
has been reported is that there were around 100 victims and some 60 missing. It will
surely be much higher when there are communications and we know what happened in Haiti.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A lot of rain must have fallen in Haiti.
With that humid mass that the hurricane brought and, after passing over the mountains,
what falls is a lot of rain. Maybe they did not have such strong winds there. But I cannot
say because we do not have the data. Although we have relations, we have not been able to
communicate with Haiti. Neither have the Dominicans, who are closer. The president of the
Dominican Republic had not been able to communicate, as I said, with Haiti. So, nobody
knows what happened there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It caused considerable damage in Puerto
Rico, too. We sent a telegram of solidarity to the people. It also caused damage in other
small eastern Caribbean islands: Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint
Kitts and Nevis, Dominica. The last three are independent Caribbean nations members of
CARICOM. Guadeloupe is a French overseas department and I think Saint Martin is partly
occupied by the French and partly by the Dutch. There is Montserrat. The English are
there. It is an English colony.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I would also like to take this opportunity
to convey, on behalf of all of you, on behalf the people of Cuba, our feelings of
solidarity to the citizens of all those countries: Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Gualaloupe,
Montserrat, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Dominica, and say that we are
deeply sorry for what has happened and, if we can cooperate in any way, we are ready to do
so. (Applause.)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, there is a difference within this
situation. Puerto Rico, as you all know, is a U.S. colony toward which that country has
certain moral obligations. It has, of course, already declared it a disaster zone and it
is to be assumed that the Puerto Ricans will receive the necessary resources to rebuild
the country. The hurricane did great damage to the housing, to many things. Guadeloupe, as
a French department, will presumably receive abundant resources from France for its
reconstruction and the same with Saint Martin and Montserrat, from France, Holland and
Great Britain.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then come those that do not have those
resources. I would say that Haiti is right at the top of the list. The degree of poverty
there is terrible. It is a small piece of land, with a population over seven million. The
Caribbean islands, independent countries such as Antigua and Barbuda only have the
cooperation that they will get from the other countries in the Caribbean. Saint Kitts and
Nevis, whose president visited us not long ago, and Dominica, all those countries have
excellent relations with us. But, who will back them up?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is true that they have options,
including the Dominican Republic and Haiti, that we do not have, like access to some soft
credit, which we suggested they request from the World Bank or the Inter-American
Development Bank, for 15 or 20 years, with minimum interest rates and a number of years'
grace. Those and other institutions can perfectly well do that for these countries,
low-interest, long-term credit with a grace period. They would then rebuild housing,
rebuild everything. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The smallest islands have hotels. They live
on tourism. I do not know the damage they may have sustained. Those hotels, in general,
are the property of foreign companies. Many of those companies do not even pay taxes for a
certain period of time and all that they contribute to the countries is jobs, which, for
the countries, is better than nothing. All they provide is the jobs. Those countries
really do not have a lot of resources. That is why I want to publicly express our view
that they can be helped by the international credit organizations and they must be helped
because they have suffered considerable destruction.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The independent countries I previously
mentioned have closer supply sources to purchase food. The Unites States is closer. It has
surpluses of some of those grains and different materials, if they are going to buy
anything. We always have to resort to more distant markets and problems arise with
transportation; longer distance and everything is not always available.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, we contacted the Dominicans because,
on Friday, the same day that we opened the Congress, they sent a message to different
countries. They explained that the country was in a state of calamity and asked for
cooperation. They also sent the message to us. As a matter of fact, we do not have a lot
of resources. You all understand the situation and they understand it too, everybody
understands it, because we have just been through a drought and a hurricane. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But we felt that we could not just stand
idly by and tell them that our situation is very tough; if there is any way, despite
everything, that we can cooperate. We gave them an immediate answer. On Saturday we told
them that we were willing to send a medical brigade, that could be sent to the most remote
and difficult places, trying of course to avoid any kind of professional jealousy, which I
am sure will not exist there. We are not there to compete with anyone. Rather, in an
emergency situation, these doctors can go any place to provide a useful service. But,
above all, it is a gesture of goodwill, a response.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They called on Friday. They contacted the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday. We replied on Saturday, telling them what we were
willing to do. They immediately accepted and yesterday, Sunday, at nine o'clock in the
morning, an IL-18 took off. It would be one of the first planes to land there, taking of
course the medical team made up of 13 specialists, two tents that can be used as makeshift
hospitals, with some instruments, a number of beds, -- 10 to be exact --, the camp beds
for our personnel, some equipment and the resources needed to look after patients in that
little hospital. There were some resources such as plasma, some medicines; everything
required for the little field hospital to function there and look after the victims. It
really is not a very great expense. The cost of the medicines sent might be around 40,000
dollars. I am saying this openly. I am not going to hide anything from you.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There will be those who will criticize,
those who are unable to understand the fundamental meaning of solidarity (Applause); those
who do not understand what it is to have high moral values; those who do not understand
the meaning of the example by a country that has just been badly affected by that
hurricane which was here longer than anywhere else and then an intense drought and all
that the equivalent... That will be the cost, Dotres, will it not? (Dotres replies that
the cost is between 40,000 and 50,000). Let's assume that it is 50,000, although this
might a be a part of what they send to us.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are blockaded. We do not have the
resources to go and buy goods quickly in Florida, some grain, some items, with minimum
transportation costs. Nor are we going to receive credits from any bank, from any of those
international institutions. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">On the other hand, we have ourselves, an
experienced people, a veteran people, a hardened people, an organized people, a protected
people. There is the information, name and municipality of the people who died. Not one
child, not one adolescent, not one youth! Despite our difficulties and shortages, we sent
the aid described to the Dominican Republic, under the responsibility of the Revolution
and with your support. (Applause.) That is what counts.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have provided the gas for the plane,
some small equipment that can be used for minor surgery, to care for the people there for
a period of time, but very much aware of what it means morally that Cuba is doing that.
They are not going to measure it by the volume but by the gesture. And if we are willing
to help a country that has suffered greater destruction than we have, I do not think we
are merely preaching with words, we are preaching with the example.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We trust the capacity of our specialists
who went there and let's hope they can save some lives!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But, their main problem is material, so
this is something practically symbolic to which we have to add the expenses in fuel, the
plane, the things inside it, the field hospital.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I want you to know that the plane left
Havana on Sunday at nine in the morning and the hospital should be set up today, Monday,
at the place chosen, in Barahona, not very far from the village of Baní, where Máximo
Gómez was born. And, how wonderful it is that we can return some of our blood, from the
donations that you in the CDRs promote, a little of our plasma to our Dominican brothers
and sisters, to the country where Máximo Gómez was born. (Applause.)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">By the way, the Dominican president told
me: &quot;Despite everything, I have some good news for you. Your village of Baní
sustained minimum damage.&quot; Some mountain must have protected it from the force of
those winds. On the other hand, Barahona -- where the medical brigade is heading,
traveling along the coast from Bani in that direction, near the border with Haiti, which
is the place chosen by the Dominican authorities-- suffered tremendously from the
hurricane. The Health Minister went to the airport to receive our delegation. They have
assigned a deputy minister the task of looking after our brigade and I expect they will do
a good job, the value of which is, I repeat, mainly of moral significance and it gives our
country the authority to talk about this subject.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I will say something else. There is still
Haiti. Well, they are talking about a number of victims, around 100 dead. They are talking
about a number of missing people. Maybe a lot of them will add to the list of the dead.
They have reported 100 dead cause by the hurricane. Why isn&#146;t that country receiving
any help? I am asking the international community. When are they going to help that
country? And does the international community want to know how many lives could be saved?
I take this dramatic occasion of the hurricane to raise this point.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Hurricanes make for good drama, but there
is a permanent hurricane over that country, like this one or worse, which is killing every
day almost as many people as those killed by the hurricane in a day, and I am talking on
the basis of precise and accurate information.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I ask the international community: Do you
want to help that country that not long ago experienced an invasion and military
intervention? Do you want to save lives? Do you want to show of a humanitarian spirit?
Let's talk now about a humane spirit and about the rights of the human being.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We say that we know how 15,000 lives can be
saved every year or, in a word, how around 25,000 lives can be saved in Haiti every year.
It is known that, every year, 135 children under five years old die for every 1,000
live-births. Again: 135 children under five years old for every 1,000 live-births.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A health program -- we have talked about
this with some political leaders who have visited our country -- could save 15,000 of
those children and, in a very conservative estimate, a further 10,000 lives of children
between 5 and 15 years old and young people and adults can be saved avoiding large
expenses.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In the face of this bitter experience, of
the damage that country has sustained, which should remind us the prolonged tragedy of
that people, why isn&#146;t help provided in that sector?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Based on the premise that the government
and people of Haiti would gladly accept a significant and crucial assistance in that
field, we propose that, if a country like Canada, closely related with Haiti, or a country
like France, historically and culturally related with Haiti, or the countries of the
European Economic Community, which are moving toward integration and already have the
euro, or Japan, if they contributed the medicines, we would contribute the doctors for
that program (Applause), all the doctors that may be necessary, even if it means sending a
complete graduation year or the equivalent.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This country, with over 60,000 medical
doctors, can take pride in saying that it has the highest number of doctors per capita in
the world. It also has trained doctors anticipating the needs of the Third World, where
many of its health professionals have worked. This country has the doctors required by the
proposed program.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We met the doctors working in South Africa
where it has become evident that language is not a barrier. Our doctors who went to South
Africa had to study English and pass a tough exam. There are around 400 there now. Several
of then are also working as professors. We know how they are appreciated. Every village is
asking for Cuban doctors. They went to villages where English was not spoken. The South
African villages where our doctors are do not speak English. But, in a really short time,
our doctors adapted to that situation. They are learning the villages dialect and
providing an excellent service. So, French or the patois spoken in Haiti, with a little
training and some books as they go along, they can learn the terminology needed for them
to communicate with the patients. That is not a problem. English is more complicated.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Besides, there is a precedent. Tens and
tens of thousands of Haitians, in the first decades of this century, came to Cuba to cut
sugar cane and work practically as slaves and language was not an obstacle for them to cut
all the cane that was needed by the US companies and those who employed Haitians to
exploit them.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It was not necessary to know their
language, just as those English speaking or Spanish speaking countries did not need to
know the language of the African villages to bring millions and millions of its people to
be enslaved and create massive fortunes for their masters.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">To heal the sick and to save lives, you do
not need prior knowledge of the village language. History has shown this, apart from our
recent experience.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In these programs, the hardest thing to
obtain is the human personnel and the human personnel we have. I am sure there will be
enough of volunteers among our young doctors. I am absolutely certain. (Prolonged
applause.) They are doctors who go to the mountains, who go to the countryside and
wherever they are needed. They are in the villages of South Africa. (A member of the
public tells him: &quot;And blood if it is needed!&quot;) (Applause.)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am taking advantage of this occasion,
this moment, when those peoples are still living the trauma of what has happened, to
propose undertaking this program to be managed by a United Nations agency, the World
Health Organization.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Haiti does not need troops. It does not
need invasions with troops. To begin with, Haiti needs invasions of medical doctors. Haiti
also needs an invasion of millions of dollars for its development. That is something we do
not have but the international institutions have plenty. The World Bank has it, other
financial institutions have it and the West has it. They have the capacity to show some
kindness. That country is counted among the poorest in the world and certainly the poorest
in Latin America, no doubt of that. A small area, an eroded soil, deforested mountains,
exhausted fishing zones. It has led to UN agreements and military invasions condoned by
the United Nations and carried out by American airborne brigades.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That country does not need airborne
brigades. It desperately needs medical brigades. We can supply the medical doctors. Let
others send teachers and still others send the essential material for schools, the
hospitals infrastructure and for that country&#146;s development. How much longer will it
take then?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They cannot say that we are going there to
indoctrinate the Haitians, because our doctors have not indoctrinated anybody in the
villages of South Africa or in the scores and scores of countries where they have worked,
beginning with Algeria at a very early stage. Our doctors went out there. Actually, the
first doctors who set out from here went to Algeria, right after independence. And when we
had no more than some 3,000 doctors, because they had taken the rest, the Revolution
opened up for them the doors to the United States, which wanted to leave our people
without any doctors. If it had not been for the Revolution, they would not have given any
visas to those who on the day of the triumph where jobless here and without any
possibility to go anywhere.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our medical doctors first internationalist
mission was in Algeria. Around 25,000 doctors and health workers have been in scores of
countries throughout the world. And, so our proposal stands. We submit it to consideration
by the countries or groups of countries I have mentioned, aside from our appeal to them
for helping the Dominican Republic and the other islands.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The really critical, critical case is that
of Haiti, a very clear case where, with a relatively modest health program, 15,000
children under five years old might be saved, thus reducing infant mortality in that age
group to 35 for 1,000 live-births. We have 9.4, almost four times less. The reduction of
that figure to less than 20 requires a more sophisticated medicine, but cutting down
mortality to 35 or 30 is relatively easy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How many mothers could be saved from those
who die in childbirth? And how many people of whatever age who die of infectious diseases,
typical of such poor countries as these, or who die of other perfectly preventable or
curable diseases? I made a very conservative estimate and I am now offering to cooperate
with the international community so that, every year, no fewer than 25,000 lives can be
saved, the vast majority of them children. If that is not done in the world, what will its
fate be?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have the human personnel. It is not an
economic cost, it is a human cost. We have the men and women capable of carrying out that
program. If they are moved to consider these words, this proposal, they may contact us at
any time, so that a study can be immediately undertaken into what needs to be done to save
that country and, of course, doctors and medicines are needed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I hope they understand that we do not want
any leading role, since this would all be subordinated to the WHO, and that we are not
going to indoctrinate anyone at all. It is difficult to indoctrinate a six months baby or
a one, two, three, four, five, six and seven years old in matters related to
Marxism-Leninism or theories about communism or political subversion. Our doctors have
never done that in the dozens of Third World countries where they have worked and saved
countless lives.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, if you will give me a little more
time, now that I have already covered most of the things I wanted to tell you today, I
would like to explain that there is a serious, grave international economic situation. It
is there for all to see and they will not be able to blame communism or socialism for
that. They will have to blame, from beginning to end, capitalism and its famous market
economies well as the world order that they have imposed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is why I have brought some materials,
from which I would like to quote a few paragraphs on the economic situation. But first, if
you will allow me, I am going to read two paragraphs to remind you of our speech at the
WTO in Geneva, that young man who spoke here, Rainer, surely knows. This was on 19 May of
this year. I became aware of the situation, the euphoria that prevailed there, the things
that were brewing. If any of you are interested, this was published in <i>Granma</i>. If
you do not have a copy of that <i>Granma</i>, maybe you can find it in a library. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">One paragraph, the first that I am going to
read you, said: &quot;The United States also has the peculiar privilege of issuing the
currency in which the central bank and the commercial bank deposits worldwide keep most of
their hard currency reserves. The transnational companies of the nation whose citizens
have the lowest saving rates are purchasing the world riches with the money saved by
people in other countries and the money printed without the gold backing agreed upon in
Bretton Woods, and unilaterally ended in 1971.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">And I concluded that statement in the
following terms, mind you:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Despite so much euphoria no one can
be sure of how long the United States economic system, ruled by blind laws of the market
economy, will be able to prevent a financial meltdown. There are no economic miracles.
That is clear now. The absurdly inflated stock values in the stockmarkets of that economy
&#150; unquestionably the strongest in the world &#150; cannot be sustained. In similar
situations history is not known to have made exceptions. The problem is that now a big
crisis would go global and have unpredictable consequences. Not even the adversaries of
the prevailing system could wish that to happen&quot;, said I, there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I then added: &quot;It would be worthwhile
for the WTO to assess these risks and include among the so-called 'new issues' another
one: 'Global Economic Crisis. What can be done?'&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This was on 19 May. Incidents have been
happening at increasingly higher speed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Three months and 10 days later, on 29
August 1998, a prestigious English magazine, <i>The Economist</i>, which is conservative
and traditional, advocate of the system and of all those theories that are very much in
vogue, in an article entitled &quot;As bad as it gets?&quot;, after affirming in an
introductory line &quot;Depending on your definition, a global recession may already have
started&quot;, it said, among other things:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The world economy resembles an
airplane that has lost two of its four engines, with a third now starting to splutter.
(...) The Russian rouble is plunging headlong. Latin America may be the next region to hit
trouble. Last but not least, Wall Street continues to wobble...&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">And further on: &quot;If Wall Street does
crash -- taking with it the world economy -- the blame will doubtless be laid on reckless
investment in Asia. But the present fragility of America's stockmarket also has much to do
with recklessness at home. Despite its recent falls, Wall street remains expensive by
historical standards -- as though investors believed that equities were safer now than
they have been for years, which they patently are not.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The problem is that those stockmarkets have
exponentially multiplied their value into fabulous sums, exactly, but exactly, the same as
in the months before the 1929 crisis. We asked the comrades at the Institute on World
Economics to collect all the information and elaborate an analysis. Nothing bears more
resemblance to the months prior to the famous 1929 crash, which led to a recession that
lasted over 10 years, as what is now happening in the US stockmarkets. It seems like a
carbon copy. The only thing is that then a crisis had very serious repercussions, but this
one, in a global world, would be much more serious.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then come other articles, this one also
from the same traditional, conservative magazine. We would even like them to send someone
to the economists meeting that we will hold in January, in order to discuss these issues
in depth. This article is called: &quot;Heading for meltdown?&quot; It is from 5 September
and states things such as the following:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The global economic crisis continues
to deepen. The latest horror, Russia's collapse, may be insignificant judged by that
economy's puny weight in the world, but it was nonetheless a turning-point: the sickness
that started in Asia is spreading still, claiming victims far beyond its source.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">And then, under the subheading &quot;Luck
and judgment&quot;: &quot;For the first time since the early 1980s, global slump is a
thinkable, even plausible, outcome (...). Indeed, in some ways, the danger now is greater
than it was then.&quot; It is not talking yet about the 1929 crisis. It is talking about
another previous crisis that was quite serious but which did not have the same calamitous
consequences of the one in 1929. &quot;Much of the world is already deep in
recession;&quot; -- the article continues to say -- &quot;the chances are that the worst
is not yet over for many big emerging-market economies (...), not to mention for a handful
of rich-country commodity producers, whose export revenues have crashed.&quot; </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is a phenomenon, present today, that
also preceded other crises and preceded the one in 1929, the collapse of basic commodity
prices. This means, among many others, coffee, cacao, minerals, aluminum, copper, zinc,
nickel, this little part affects us. Nickel is at half the price it was a few years ago,
barely recouping costs at the plant. Of course, the price of oil, another basic commodity
in many countries, has also dropped quite a bit. Oil producers are making desperate
maneuvers to try to raise prices.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;... Mid-week,&quot; the article
continues, &quot;Wall Street stood some 15% lower than at its peak in July. Yet at these
prices American equities are still dear.&quot; That is the problem, extremely high.
&quot;If the market were to fall another 20%, say, the shock to American consumers might
be enough to bring the country's long expansion to an end. With it would go any hope that
the United States could pull the world out of its troubles.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have only read some paragraphs.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Another article appeared on the same day in
the same magazine -- &quot;On the edge&quot;, it is called. It reads: &quot;The risks of a
deep global recession are increasing.&quot; It then adds: &quot;... The world economy has
become far more dangerously poised even during the past month, let alone over the past
year. At the annual meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, over the weekend, some central bankers were privately admitting that these are
the worst global economic conditions they have seen in their lifetime.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It goes on to say: &quot;... Japan and most
of the rest of East Asia is in deep recession. GDP is expected to fall by as much as 15%
in Indonesia this year, and by 6-7% in South Korea and Thailand. Russia's government has,
in effect, defaulted on its debt; its economic predicament worsens by the day. China may
yet respond to the sharp slowdown in its economy by devaluing its exchange rate, and the
Hong Kong dollar is under severe pressure. Latin America still teeters on the brink.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Even some developed economies, such
as Britain's and Canada's, are slowing. And Wall Street has fallen sharply from its peak.
Indeed, tumbling share prices have wiped almost $4 trillion off the world's financial
wealth over the past two months -- the equivalent of Japan's GDP.&quot; That is, in only
two months, the world's financial wealth has dropped by almost four trillion dollars as a
result of a fall in stock values. Such wealth, measured in terms of stock values, has its
ups and downs. But that is the trend that has become very much apparent: it has already
lost four trillion dollars, what we would call in Spanish <i><b>billones</b></i> but, in
English, four trillion dollars. In how much time? Two months.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When did we raise this prospect? On 19 May.
We had already begun raising it before then, but not in an international organization
where there were ministers of economy or trade from every country member of WTO. Of
course, euphoria reigned then and there. Now, it is not simply what I said. The most
prestigious advocate of the system are now saying it.</font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Economist</i> continues stating in the
article what we have been commenting on: &quot;World output grew at an average of 4% in
1996 and 1997, but J.P. Morgan, an American bank, now forecasts growth of a mere 1.5% this
year and 1.7% next.&quot; And it continues: &quot;But if the [predictions] turn out
correct, this would be the same growth over the two years as in 1981-82, the world
economy's worst 'recession' since the 1930s.&quot; That was the worst recession since the
1930s.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Further on, it reads: &quot;Russia's
implosion has triggered a new phase in the emerging-market crisis. Its economy accounts
for a mere 2% of world output, so its direct impact on world trade and output is tiny. But
the indirect effects -- through commodity markets, investors' confidence, the cost of
capital -- are proving far bigger. Coming on top of other financial troubles, Russia's
plight could be the straw that breaks the camel's back.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The sickness has spread far and wide:
to Eastern Europe, South Africa and Latin America. Venezuela may soon be forced to devalue
its currency. Brazil's economy is not in such a bad shape as Russia's, but there are some
nasty similarities, not least a big budget deficit (7% of GDP). Brazil has suffered a
heavy capital outflow in recent weeks.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;... The prices of industrial
commodities are now at their lowest in real terms since the 1930s.&quot; These commodities
that are mentioned more than once are the main exports of the Third World countries,
although some of them, like certain minerals, are also exported to some developed
countries. &quot;This has severely hurt commodity producers, not just in Latin America and
Africa, but also in Australia and Canada.&quot; In other words, the conditions are ripe.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The bubble bursts.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Perhaps the scariest fallout from the
latest turmoil in Russia has been the fall in Wall Street and other developed markets.
Despite a midweek rally, the Dow Jones Industrial Average&quot; -- this is an index that
they have for measuring how the New York Stock Exchange is performing -- &quot;is still
down by 17% from its peak, wiping out all this year's gains...&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;But the biggest risk to the American
economy is not a slowdown in exports, but a further big fall in its stockmarket.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It also says: &quot;... it is unlikely to
turn into anything like a 1930s-style depression, when America's GDP fell by 30% over
three years. There are many similarities between now and the late 1920s, such as falling
commodity prices and a overvalued stockmarket.&quot; They then explain some arguments,
some differences between both periods. It says, for example, in the first place, that
countries used the gold standard and it was consequently more difficult to ease monetary
policy. This is an argument they give, not on their own account but invoking a well-known
economist.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They put it as follows: &quot;... This
restricted their ability to ease monetary policy as economies went into recession after
the Wall Street crash of 1929.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Second, governments compounded their
tight-money mistake with tight fiscal policies, even in the depth of the depression.&quot;
It adds other arguments: &quot;Rather than allowing taxes to fall automatically as income
declined, the Americans raised taxes...&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It adds: &quot;Not only do governments have
a better understanding of macroeconomics today, but now that public spending takes a much
bigger share of GDP, their ability to stabilize demand is greater.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The third difference between today
and the 1930s is that there were no global organizations such as the G7 or the IMF to
oversee the world economy. The IMF was set up in 1944 at the instigation of the Americans
to head off any future global economic collapse ... [and] to provide temporary financial
assistance to countries with balance-of-payments problems.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The fact of the matter is that today the
whole world has practically rebelled against the International Monetary Fund. They are
starting to blame it for all the disasters that are taking place. You would have to see
the number of articles published by the analysts in these specialized magazines. These
magazines are practically the last word on matters relating to economics and on what is
happening there. Other magazines with a different editorial line are even more critical.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have been reading paragraphs from a
magazine that would be the last to say things that might involve an anti-capitalist idea.
The last argument indicated lists some supposed advantages nowadays as compared to 1929.
We see the system's leaders coming up with different things in order to avoid the worst.
As we have said to some friends of ours, they are terrified that the crisis might go from
Russia to Brazil and from Brazil to the rest of Latin America.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They analyze the conditions in Brazil, with
a high budget deficit, a high deficit too in its current account, an overvalued currency,
as they put it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We had the opportunity to visit Brazil and
talk for many hours with the president of that enormous country about all these issues. It
was a very interesting exchange of impressions. I will not be committing any indiscretion
if I tell you that we have seen Brazil making great efforts to stop the crisis, adopting
drastic measures in order to try to prevent and avoid an unfavorable economic outcome.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What have they done to avoid a sudden
capital outflow, to avoid devaluation of their currency and to keep their reserves? They
have considerably increased the interest rate. At the moment, it is around 50%. So anybody
who has money deposited there will reason: Well, that is better, with interest at 50%,
instead of taking my money out, I will keep it in the country, making high profits. An
interest of 50% a year represents a considerable benefit for investors but, at the same
time, a high cost for the economy, the operating capital and the national investment.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The president explained to me how, even in
agriculture, the interest rate is different. It was around 8% or 9%. They were keeping it
lower protecting it in some way. They were likewise protecting, as far as possible, the
export industries because, with such a high interest rate, the aim of which is to protect
the country from the actions by speculators, no industry in the world can be competitive. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">He explained how, on the other hand, they
were maintaining high interest rates for non-essential or, rather, luxury production. They
explained to us, at length, a lot of things, their points of view, so we had a chance to
learn and, at the same time, exchange views. They have made additional efforts in recent
days, tough measures to reduce the budget deficit, on the eve of elections that will be
held in a few days. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, the United States is very
worried that the crisis might spread to Brazil. This is an advantage for the Brazilians
and the South Americans in general, because the United States considers them to be almost
the last defense. All the other defenses have started collapsing and a crisis in Brazil
would have grave consequences for all of Latin America.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What happens then in the New York Stock
Exchange? Its time, its turn would come. It is to be expected that, strategically, they
would try to defend themselves in South America and find some money to support their
finances. Of course, the International Monetary Fund does not have funds.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There remain the problems in Southeast
Asia. And nobody knows at this point how the problem of Russia will be solved. Well, I
believe that Russia would need 100 billion and, in the United States, the Congress has
opposed this in some way. It is putting up resistance to the handover of some 22 billion
dollars. Look, 22 billion in Russia is a drop of water in the ocean. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In all probability, the Americans will take
refuge in South America, for their own interests, not for South America because,
otherwise, the relapse of the crisis would reach as far as Mexico again and the Latin
American stockmarkets -- all of them -- are already at 50% of the values that they had
reached before. I do not think that it would have such a catastrophic effect on the
region, because they are smaller stockmarkets, they do not have the tremendous weight of
the stockmarkets in the United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The stocks value in the United States is
enormous. However, their present or, rather, their former value has already dropped, the
article says that by 17% of the maximum value. Of course, they say that an additional drop
of 15% or 20% would have dreadful consequences.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Observe that in the US stockmarkets,
stockholders have won 9 trillion dollars in four years. Can you even imagine such a
figure? The wealth of the stockholders has grown by that amount. However in 1929, only 5%
of the US citizens owned stocks, perhaps less, but never more than 5%. Today, all of the
insurance banks and all of the social security funds, all the savings of the middle class
an even many of the workers have deposited money in insurance banks, where they accrue
enormous sums of money which, to a great extent, have been invested in these stocks.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All this increased the expenditures: the
greater the available wealth, due to the rise of the stocks value, the more they spent.
This is what they called a virtuous circle, which is beginning to transform into a vicious
circle. And why virtuous? Because, by artificially multiplying their wealth and expenses,
buying more and more within and outside the United States, investing in everything and
everywhere, they stepped up production and services and consequently lowered unemployment
and increased the Gross Domestic Product. They have other mechanisms but I shall not go
into details.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In substance, since they had more money,
they began to buy like madmen. Everyone who owned a car would change it for a new one, and
if it was worth $15 000 they would buy one for $20 000, and they would also buy yachts,
etc. Spending money on everything under the sun. With a domestic market of 270 million
people, the weight of 50% of the stockholders at the stock market has a stronger bearing
on the demand for goods and services.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The problems with the balance of payment
are no problems for them. That is paid with Treasury bonds. The United States is the only
country in the world which can afford to have a 100 to 200 billion dollar commercial
deficit and yet buy all the raw material it wants. The only country in the world, among
other reasons because there is no longer a gold standard and the banknotes and bonds of
that country have become everybody&#146;s reserve currency and securities.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When there was a gold standard, any person
with dollars could get the gold that the bill was worth, and some were getting it.
However, during the Vietnam war, the United States lost two thirds of the gold that it had
accumulated after World War II. It was then that it suspended the gold standard, that is,
the right of anyone with a dollar to demand the gold. But the world moves on, and it had
no other alternative but to use that paper as a universal instrument of exchange and
reserve currency.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Furthermore, many people deposit their
money in US banks. The Japanese are the ones who have deposited the most or acquired
Treasury Bonds, thus preserving a certain interest rate. When shareholders are frightened
and panic breaks out, they sell their shares and stop buying gold. They also buy US
Treasury Bonds which have traditionally maintained their reserve. They have managed to do
it, based on the huge benefits derived from the two World Wars. They became immensely
rich. They only became involved at the end of both wars, did not suffer any material
damage, accumulated great wealth and achieved considerable economic development.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At the end of World War II, it was the only
country that had remained intact; Japan did not exist, the USSR was destroyed; England,
France and Germany were also destroyed and all the other countries were penniless. There
was only one rich and industrialized country, perhaps Sweden also, because even in Norway
there was a destructive war. They had hoarded practically all the gold in the world; the
bills they printed circulated universally for their value in gold. They could print bills
as long as they had gold. They unilaterally suspended the dollar conversion into gold. It
was a trap, the world had been robbed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then the value of gold increased
tremendously, immediately. They artificially kept it at a low price. They would buy
whenever the price of gold was about to fall. When it was about to go up, they sold gold
from their enormous reserves and kept the price at approximately 35 dollars an ounce. Then
they suppressed the conversion and a boom in oil prices occurred.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The price of an ounce of gold reached more
than 400 dollars. They still had approximately 10 billion in gold, and the price of that
gold grew tremendously, at least 10 times. The gold standard ceased to exist and there
were no more limits. They would print Treasury Bonds with a certain interest rate for a
certain number of years. They preserved the tradition of those bonds which were the safest
securities in the market. This is where investors who sell their stocks in times of
uncertainty and panic seek refuge. They sell but they do not buy stocks elsewhere, only
Treasury bonds. Therefore, they have all the money they need to pay for any budget deficit
or a deficit in the balance of payment.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Not now. Now, with the progress this has
enabled them to make in the economy they have more or less balanced the budget, not so the
balance of trade whose deficit grows. They must pay huge amounts of money for their
imports, more than what they get for their exports. That is the mechanism.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This way, stock holders have earned 9
trillion and they have spent according to what they have earned, as they watch their stock
values rise. Because if you have 100,000 dollars and all of a sudden your stocks are worth
200,000, you say. Oh! why should I save? I will buy everything I want so you end up buying
a yacht or even a plane. All of this boosted, as I said, the growth of the economy; it
boosted employment, everything was great, an exclusive benefit, an exclusive privilege of
theirs. That is why they have bought, well, no one knows... They have almost bought the
whole world!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is why the Europeans want to
integrate, in order to survive. They want to have a strong currency so that these tricks
can not be played on them, so that part of the reserves in central banks are made up of
euros. And it is good for the world that there should be another currency. I wish there
were others, two, three more, strong ones, because today the whole world depends on the
dollar. It is the main, almost unique, reserve currency. They print paper, buy things, and
an important part of that paper is put away by other countries in their reserves.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In other words, they have had a very
privileged situation. Stocks multiplied their value with all the support of an economy
growing at a steady rate for a relative long period of time; the unemployment rate that
was dropping. Inflation, the other enemy they fear like hell did not increase. On the
contrary, the price of products from Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand, and all those
countries have dropped after their currencies were devalued. This contributed to keeping
inflation down. But Aladdin's lamp begins to lose its magic power to do wonders.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The great discussion on the US Federal
Reserve interest rates --I have already talked about what it meant for Brazil--, reflects
deep contradictions. If they raise the interests rates, they worsen the situation of all
the weakened currencies and the economies of Southeast Asia, Japan, Russia and increase
the risks for Brazil, South America and other countries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What is everybody demanding now? &quot;Hey,
please lower the interest rates, lower them.&quot; But they are trying to carefully manage
the situation, because if they lower the rates too much, everybody begins asking for loans
to buy and spend, and loans to invest. This can bring about an excess of circulating cash
which can immediately turn into inflation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was telling you what the Brazilians do
with the interest rate to avoid the capital outflow and keep their reserves. But they can
not maintain a 50% rate for too long, despite the exceptions mentioned for agriculture and
the exporting sectors, because all of the working capital of the other industries and
services must pay a 50% annual interest rate, and what industry has high enough profits to
pay a 50% interest rate? In other words, they would bring the economy to a standstill.
Loans cost a lot more. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">For a time, they can hold back the panic
and the capital outflow, keep people from exchanging the national currency into dollars.
Because the exchange of currency there is free. They can exchange it and take it out of
the country. But, on the other hand, that mechanism is a double-edged sword, it halts the
economy and creates an unsustainable situation. They can not maintain it for long. These
are the mechanisms they have been using to defend themselves, to avoid losing all of their
reserve in hard currency.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In August, Brazil lost billions, I do not
remember if 10 to 15 billion of its reserves, just in August and early September. They had
been able to accumulate those reserves and they had managed to do so with great hardships
and, partly, by privatizing enterprises. There was a telephone company that they
privatized which gave them 18 billion. It was an important income, but it was lost in a
few days defending the national currency from speculation. They have had to take new,
strict measures. The Brazilians are struggling, they are defending their currency, but
there is no doubt that they are going to need income from abroad. How much will it be?
Well, no one knows exactly.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They offered Mexico -- in this case being a
close neighbor of the United States was an advantage -- up to 50 billion. But when the
crisis reached Southeast Asia and then Korea, their favorite international financial
institutions had no funds left. So, now they are terrified with that spreading fire.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I think they will make an effort. It is
clearly seen that a good place to entrench themselves is Latin America, to keep the fire
from reaching their own premises.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Contrary to the Latin American
stockmarkets, those in the United States have a huge economic weight, because colossal
funds are invested in them. I have already told you that in the last four years they had
earned 9 trillion dollars, although they must start deducting now.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have already told you about the article
which affirmed that putting all the stockmarkets together, the world had lost almost four
trillion dollars in only two months. That is, not only the United States, part of these
losses are theirs, when the value of their stockmarket shares fell 17% from its highest
point, according to the last of the articles referred to. Do you understand?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Forgive me for going into details this way,
but I am trying to make you understand these mechanisms and how the collapse can take
place.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So now they are putting out the fire. The
one in Russia... I think they have given up from trying to put out the fire in Russia.
This is very serious because of its implications, including political ones. I think they
will try to entrench themselves in Brazil and in South America, trying to prevent a
disaster like that one in Southeast Asia. Then the fire will inevitably reach them, and it
might happen like in 1982, or worse yet, like in 1929, or even worse than in 1929, despite
their IMF, their World Bank and all the tricks they have been devising.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">To be sure, since the great experience of
the 1929 crisis and the recession that lasted 10 years, in which the country's GDP dropped
to 30%, unemployment rose to incredible heights; it seemed as if capitalism would meet its
end at the time. Then came Roosevelt, another formula, and they barely saved it in ten
years. But it might be worse now, because this world is global.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They have to analyze well what consequences
it would have within the United States for that 50% of Americans who have their social
security money and their savings in those stocks, if the stocks drop to one half or one
third of their value.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That had never happened before. When the
great crisis of 1929, the number of people who owned stocks was very small. Its effect,
however, was disastrous. What would it be like now when half of that country plus those
with the most resources have their wealth invested in the stockmarket? The fellow who
lives under the bridge has no stocks in the stock market (Laughter). The big
transnationals, the big industrial tycoons, the middle class, many professionals,
high-income workers, they are the ones who invest. Anyone who has some money, on seeing
that values have been rising like foam --and that is where the danger lies--, invests
there, and encounters these problems which are typical of a capitalist society, typical of
a market economy. No one can control that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are already a lot of people stating
the advisability of having the State regulate this some way, or regulate the operations,
the capitals that come on a short term basis and then go. That is against neoliberalism,
against everything it has been doing and preaching. Yet, they are beginning to speak with
growing energy against allowing the free stocks of those short-term capitals, and other
types of regulations the absolute freedom that financial capital enjoys today.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Prime Minister of Malaysia, who also
visited us, has been concerned about this matter for a long time. He has just suppressed
the free exchange of currencies, taken a series of measures and is entrenched defending
his country's economy, although it has declined due to the devastating blow it received.
He told me that the work and the accumulated wealth of 40 years could be lost in two
weeks.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All countries are exposed to this. Not a
single one can escape. That is why Europe is uniting. No European country alone can escape
that enormous power accumulated by the United States. The Europeans are seeking for a
market of hundreds of millions of people. The United States has a domestic market of no
less than 270 million, a very big market. A small country can only have a market of 10
million no matter how industrialized it may be. They are all uniting in Europe, the 15
countries of the Union, amounting to some three hundred odd or four hundred million
people. They aspire to incorporate more countries in the future to keep safe from the
monster, but it can almost be said that the monster is fatally wounded. It is an
unsustainable system that is nearing that crisis, as I have explained here.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They still have hopes and the capacity to
maneuver, and they have been devising formulas since the 1929 crisis, to prevent something
similar from happening. A not too serious one occurred in 1982, but the one that is coming
now, based on the premises I have indicated, could be much worse. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Besides, they have been too divided in the
United States itself. The Administration has advisors and acts somewhat more skillfully
defending the economic interests of the empire. But the rest are at war with it, with the
support of the majority in the Senate and the House, and have not adopted the fast-track
for the agreements with which the Administration wants to tie the Latin American and
Caribbean countries to the empire's economic interests. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They are putting up a great resistance
against the government to increase a little the funds of the IMF, but even if they were to
give them the 15 billion or 18 billion for the IMF --I think they had already given 3
billion--, it is just a drop of water in the desert and it would be difficult to even
suppose that they might try to save Russia, instead of entrenching themselves in the last
stronghold they have left: South America. But, it may so happen that even while they are
entrenched, the problems continue to grow and to worsen, because what we are seeing here
is a congenital disease of the system.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have not finished, I have still a little
more to say. If you are patient enough... Yes, I have been talking for a while, but it is
worth it. Do you want to know how our friend Russia is faring? Are you interested? (People
exclaim: &quot;Yes!&quot;) Very well, I am going to read some paragraphs of articles that
have appeared in the capitalist press specialized in economic issues. In this case, they
are from the same British magazine I already mentioned.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This one is entitled <i>Russia devalued</i>.
Remember that they are the same analysts who applauded time and again, from the
perestroika to neoliberalism, privatizations and market economy as the great miracle to
improve the economy and the life in that country, where, as you know, and those of you who
studied there know it even better, with a rouble you could have breakfast, lunch, dinner
and you still had some money left, with a rouble!. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Afterwards the rate was 6,000 roubles to a
dollar. Now, in order to work better with the figures, they took away three zeros, and
they established a new rouble equal to 6 dollars. Once again it had to be devalued and,
instead of 6, it is now quoted at approximately 18 per dollar. And this also changes every
day. People there have lost their money twice. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When they had the first devaluation,
everyone who had some money saved, mark my words, everyone who had money in the bank or
anywhere else lost it! Because if you have a certain amount of roubles and the rouble is
suddenly or gradually devalued sixthousandfold, if you had 6,000 roubles for example, each
more or less equal to a dollar, as to purchasing power, you would see those 6,000 roubles
turned into a dollar.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Look how different from what was done in
Cuba. When there was a change of currency at the beginning of the revolutionary process,
the money in the banks was never touched, and recently, when we took all those measures to
reduce the excess circulating cash, we did not touch the money in the banks either. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The money of all of those who trusted the
banks and kept their money there --some who had a little bit, some who had a little more
and some who had a whole lot; some, who had accounts in different banks, just in case,
based on previous experiences, all the money was respected. Even those who accumulate
quite a lot were able to keep their money. Of course, there are many decent, honest people
among them. I know very hard-working, honest farmers, who without the agricultural market
or anything like it have accumulated 300,000; 400,000 or 500,000 pesos, because they had
very high yields. Ten thousand quintals of potatoes brought 40,000 or 50,000 pesos per
year, and they put that money in the bank. There are those who earned their money that
way. Others, as you know, earned it either selling at very high prices or one way or
another.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But, what occurred in Cuba with so much
circulating cash, after the special period set in? We held discussions in the National
Assembly, we held discussions everywhere, but we did not touch the money in the banks,
there was no change of currency. Those who had that money could use it to buy the things
they buy from the quota assigned to them, although, right now, unfortunately, in more
reduced quantities, as I have explained, at the historic, subsidized prices. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Cuban money can be used to go to a movie
and to many recreational activities. Medicines, building materials, electricity, telephone
services, rent, sport functions and whatever else the population is entitled to in many
other fields, goods and services, are all paid in Cuban pesos. There are important, vital
services that do not even need the peso to pay for them, they are absolutely free. The
measures were taken for the people and, naturally, its national currency continued to have
the same value in relation to all these things.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At a point in time, those who engaged in
exchanging currency were able to get 150 pesos for a dollar, but thanks to the measures
taken by the Revolution in every respect, all the measures we have talked about --some of
which have brought us the problems we have analyzed-- and, with a certain recovery of our
economy -- which is not much, we still have not climbed back to 1989 level, and some time
will pass before we do--, the fact is that without fuel, without timber, without raw
materials, without all of those resources that Russia so abundantly has, we did not touch
the peso and everyone's trust in the banks was preserved, for that is where the money is
most safely kept. But what is more incredible: a revaluation of the peso in relation to
the dollar, from 150 to 19, 20, 21, 22 or 23, in the exchange bureaus.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So our peso, and all the pesos of those who
had money in the bank or elsewhere, was simply revalued. The exchange bureaus bring in a
little money, they control, they regulate. If the demand for dollars increases, they raise
the price of the dollar. They always guarantee some income, but that was what the
speculators who engaged in those dealings, exchanging dollars and pesos, used to earn. And
there is a certain amount of income, not much. Do not think it is much, but it solves some
problems and some needs. Do you know what the profits obtained in the exchange bureaus are
used for? They are totally handed over to the Ministry of Domestic Trade, for some
products or others, or the raw materials to manufacture them, even some that are sold in
the parallel markets. Well, yes, they are expensive, we know that. They have this to meet
certain needs and, at the same time, to collect circulating cash in order to maintain the
best possible balance between wages and prices, between pesos and dollars. So those
exchange bureaus give the country an additional benefit. In this case, the old saying that
the bank never loses is confirmed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But if we start letting money go into
circulation again then we will be back in the same hapless situation. When the peso is
devalued so are the salaries. Because even if someone earns, let's say, 200 pesos, if he
wants to buy a dollar some day to spend it in one of those shops, he has the possibility
to get that dollar, it costs him 20 pesos. If the exchange rate climbs to 50 or 100
dollars per peso, he does not have that possibility. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Notice that this country has revalued the
peso, the national currency. This has not happened anywhere else, only through the
measures implemented and thanks to our socialist system, despite being under a severe
blockade and under the conditions of the special period.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But over there, in Russia, a person who had
6,000 rubles was left with only one dollar. Now, with the new ruble, a person who had
10,000 --there are some over there who make that much in half a minute-- or, let us say,
6,000, would have the equivalent of 1,000 dollars; when the ruble is quoted at 12, he has
the equivalent of 500 dollars, when it is quoted at 18, he has the equivalent of 300 and
some odd dollars, and when it is quoted at 20 and at even more, as it has been the case,
what he has left is 300 dollars or less. In a matter of days the worker loses what he has
saved from his salary, that is, in the event that they are paying his salary. The nouveaux
riches, of course, do not suffer at all; they have their money safe abroad, converted into
dollars and into large, luxurious mansions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Concerning this Russian crisis that they
are talking about --bear in mind that I was reading a paragraph written in late August, it
is said that the turning point in the global crisis that is so seriously affecting the
world economy begins with the recent Russian financial crisis. That is the thesis
advanced. In Russia, the State was confiscated by all of those gentlemen who had the
West's absolute trust, by those who applied all the recipes of the West, by those who
privatized everything. And it was &quot;Oh, happy West!&quot;, &quot;how marvelous!&quot;,
&quot;that country is really going to develop!&quot;, &quot;what profitable investment we
are going to make there!&quot;. And they gave them loans for tens of billions of dollars.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But, the fall of production in Russia led
them to dump into the market all the nickel they had accumulated, we know very well how
much that cost us. The Rotterdam docks were full of nickel, and all the copper, all the
minerals they could hold, and that has a lot to do with the so-called commodities. That is
why the article said that Russia, although it represents only 2% of the world economy,
being a great producer of nickel and of all sorts of raw material, unable to use those
items in its production, which fell more than 50% in relation to what it produced in 1989
and 1990, dumped them all into the world market.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They said that a bigger economic
catastrophe would make them dump everything they have left into the commodities market,
reducing these prices even further. This is one of the factors they consider would
increase the dangers of a big recession. They mentioned two factors in the article I read:
the drop in commodity prices and the overvalued stocks in the US stockmarkets. That is why
they say that although Russia represents only 2% of the world economy, it has a lot of
influence, this, without dwelling in other more worrying, serious dangers, just the
economic. But well that catastrophe has come about and now they have no money, the
reserves are depleted, because everybody rushed to exchange their rubles for dollars,
which is what usually happens, and they inevitably had to suspend the exchange of rubles
for dollars. That alone was a sacrilegious violation of all the IMF rules. They had
already negotiated a loan of around 22 billion dollars with this institution, with the
help of the West, the United States, everybody, but under very strict rules and
conditions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What is this about suspending the free
exchange of currency? It is a sacrilege, they no longer have the free exchange of
currency. They suspended their debt payment, another serious sacrilege. How can that be
accepted by the IMF or the World Bank or the United States, who is the owner of all that.
That business is managed by the United States. It owns 17% of shares in the IMF and has a
similar participation in the World Bank. Power of veto: with 15% it can veto any
agreement. They decide all that the IMF and the World Bank approve. The Federal Reserve,
the US Treasury, the World Bank and the IMF meet and decide what they are going to do.
Well, they were scared because of what was happening in Russia, to which they had offered
22 billion. The situation there was really in bad shape, because they suspended the debt
payments, the free exchange of currency and they even spoke about printing money to pay
salaries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The shops began to empty. Before that,
everybody had made a run on the banks to change rubles for dollars. The reserve, which was
not very high, 14 or 15 billion, was rapidly disappearing. They stopped, they suspended
the free exchange.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In other words, when everybody ran to
exchange their rubles for dollars, that type of operation was halted. They also stopped
the foreign debt payments. There was no hard currency for that, and they could not exhaust
what little they had left. Everything that they have done goes against the rules and
conditions set by those institutions, which then decided not to hand over the 22 billion. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, the gentlemen from the West are so
stupid that they are liable not to give them that money. The consequences would be still
worse, and they would not only be economic consequences, they would be political and
security consequences. It would seem, I have already said it, as if they had given up on
saving that country. You can imagine how worried they are, putting more and more pressure,
saying no, that they will give the money only if all those methods are strictly applied,
to wit: free convertibility, debt payment, levying of taxes, and so on, and so forth.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Over there, more than half of the existing
taxes are not collected, and the big enterprises of the multimillionaires that confiscated
the State with the West's support do not pay taxes. They bought the major media, the main
radio and television networks.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Just look at the freedom of the press that
the West has obtained!, and the freedom it defends! The people lost the media, now they
are in the hands of the large groups of multimillionaires who confiscated the State. They
became owners of the big oil and gas enterprises, of any export item. They took over the
main industries. They bought the most powerful media. Such and such a group has such and
such networks, such and such a group has such others, all these names are available.
Someone can write an article to explain this better, with more time available and giving
more details. So, many of the most important media are in their hands. They are the ones
in charge, and that is that. They publish what they want published and nothing else. They
own the main sectors of industry, they own the media and also the banks.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Just look how well the banking business was
doing, that they established up to 4,000 banks. What did some of these banks do? Many
Russians confidently went to deposit their money in those banks and many of those banks
declared themselves bankrupt and stole the depositors' money, as simple and unpunished as
that. They exchanged the money for dollars and took it away. In other words, many Russians
have been swindled by many of those banks which are in the hands of the mafia. Market
economy in its purest form.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is something called the mafia,
resulting from all of those reforms that the West so cherishes, defends and glorifies. Now
nobody wants to invest because the mafia has taken over everything. I hope that does not
happen to you in the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, that we do not make the
big mistakes that facilitate such things. We are fighting against those who steal in
houses or stores. Very well! Over there they robbed the riches of the socialist State.
They invented different mechanisms --I will not go into that -- in order to do it. They
even gave out some bonds, the bonds were immediately devalued, then they bought the bonds
and they took over the enterprises. It was all very democratic. They gave out part of the
bonds to the workers, but soon those bonds were not worth a single penny, they were
devalued. These guys came around, bought them, and that is that; they are the owners of
big banks, big enterprises, all of that. They do not pay taxes.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What have they done with the money? The
West does not speak of this. Oh, no!, they hardly talk of it, or do not mention it. Every
now and then, they feel ashamed and they talk about it in some small paragraphs. But the
fact is that, since they established that model, from 200 to 500 billion dollars have fled
Russia. This is something that must be known. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">With the free exchange of currency,
everyone who could exchange currency did so; feeling unsafe in such situation, they
exchanged it, and sent their money to the Scandinavian countries, to all of Europe. In
Spain alone, the wealthy Russians had 60,000 mansions, and they have others in southern
France, no one knows how many they have in Austria, in all of Europe in the Scandinavian
countries. In Cyprus, a small country, they have a lot of banks and other things. They are
experts in confiscating the State assets, experts in getting money out of the country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Notice the figure, a minimum of 200 billion
and a maximum of 500 billion. Let's say it is 250 or 300 billion. Who can withstand that?
How can they pay the teachers, the doctors, the scientists, the workers, the army, the
missile operators, the pilots? Even those who are orbiting in outer space have been left
without a budget, without a budget for the spaceship that has to go fetch them.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The strategic missiles operators based in
Krasnoyarsk had not been paid for 5 months. It was so serious that a General of those who
were in Afghanistan, whose mindset is still unknown, who is a mystery, but what is clearly
seen is that he wants to run for president, that he won the elections in Krasnoyarsk
because people are desperate, he is the one who negotiated peace in Chechnya. A few days
after he took over as governor, he wrote a letter to the former prime minister, the one
they had appointed, asking him to put under his jurisdiction the strategic missiles based
in Krasnoyarsk, because he could at least give those people food and clothing.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Just notice what kind of order, what level
of discipline is left, that the governor of Krasnoyarsk writes asking to put under his
jurisdiction the strategic missiles of the region: a region turned into a big nuclear
power. Meanwhile, the operators there are not paid. It is the last thing a government can
do, leave the strategic missiles operators unpaid, something terribly dangerous. But this
gives you an idea of the situation there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The army has not been paid for months, only
an elite division of the Ministry of the Interior, with very high salaries, that the
government, in this case we have to say the presidency, has there as a reserve, an elite
division. They were not paying the army. The first thing done by the new prime minister,
formerly the minister of foreign affairs, was to hold a meeting with all the military and
order that the army be paid.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But, where its the money for that? They
said: &quot;Let's print it.&quot; So the third big fight with all those international
agencies broke out. Print? &quot;No, that is utter madness, absurd, you can not print, for
such and such a reason.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then they were demanding that they cut down
the budget. That budget can not be cut any further. What is it they want, that the
strategic missiles operators do not get paid for a year, that nobody gets paid for a year?
How much longer? And the coal miners and the others how much longer? if they are bringing
to a halt the trains on the Siberian railroad. How?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The new government has a very hard task
ahead. He is, undoubtedly, an earnest man, a competent man, but he is facing a almost
impossible problem.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Some have spoken about rationing, some have
spoken about renouncing all those funds, promises that will not solve anything. It has
created a frightening situation, there is fear everywhere, because no one knows what might
happen in that country under such circumstances. But they can not comply with the
conditions demanded by the IMF to give them the 22 billion. They can not, it is
impossible.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Everybody who has a ruble left runs to the
bank and exchanges it, takes it away. But, as I have told you, the West did not say
anything and is not saying anything. You can not see any of that in these articles, the
hundreds of billions that fled that country thanks to those mechanisms that have destroyed
the country. The Russian population has declined, the situation is catastrophic, not even
money works anymore. There are whole towns living exclusively on bartering. Those who
produce coal give others coal for the winter &#150;winter is coming now-- in exchange for
agricultural produce. What is functioning in Russia today is the barter of goods rather
than the use of money.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How can the new government, irrespective of
its competence, its earnestness, find a way out of this situation? This man was minister
of foreign affairs, he once visited Cuba. He is a man who everyone respects over there.
But what is he to do now? Should he accept the IMF's conditions? Who are they going to
collect taxes from, how are they going to pay, how are they going to cut the budgets when
they are at their lowest? How? How are they going to pay all those people? Well, should
there be a rationing of goods? Of course, that would be the most fair and logical thing to
do. That would make them stronger, of course. I am not recommending them anything, we stay
out of that. I am simply analyzing the situation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, I have told you that the people ran
to exchange their rubles for dollars. When the free exchange was stopped, they ran to the
shops to buy, without limits, all the goods they could find there, while they lasted. The
small time shopkeepers must have made a lot of money, because they must have raised the
prices, when the caravan was stopped, the exchange of rubles for dollars was stopped,
everyone who had one of those pieces of paper went to the shops to buy what they could
find and the shops began to empty. How do you cope with a situation like this? Can they
avoid rationing even if they are given the money? But if they are given the money, they
cannot do any rationing or print any bills or any of those things, and they have to pay
the debts and they have to cut the budget.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At a very difficult moment, the government
has been placed in a very difficult position. That is the predicament right now in Russia
and they are between the devil and the deep blue sea. Let us hope that the devil goes by
without doing very much harm, but the truth is that they are in that very tight fix. We
read about that situation every day.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Did I make all this up? No, allow me, at
least, to demonstrate that I did not make it up. The article I mentioned at the beginning
of this topic states, among other things:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;It has not been a good week for
Russia. The bundle of measures thrown to the financial wolves on Monday amounts to the
end, for the time being at least, of all prospects of further economic reform&quot;. They
are still talking about economic reforms, a larger dose of that poison as a remedy.
&quot;It may also mark the start of a political degeneration that sees the country slide
towards nationalism, autocracy or something nastier. It consigns to the dust bin the last
boast of the government's battered reformers, that their policies at least brought
currency stability and steady prices&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;...They have been imposed, it should
be remembered, only four weeks after the IMF and other foreign lenders agreed on $23
billion-worth of props for the Russian economy, and only three days after pledges from Mr.
Yeltsin that there would be no devaluation and vows from his ministers that all debts
would be honored. What went wrong?&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The short answer is that much of the
lending has gone not to guarantee the deposits of deserving savers, nor even to pay the
pensions of impoverished old folks or the wages of unpaid miners.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The danger is that the loss of
confidence will continue. If so, the ruble -- supposedly freed to float, but in reality to
sink-- could merely gurgle on downward, the banks could be besieged by depositors large
and small and, if no more credit from abroad is forthcoming, the government could be
tempted to resort to the printing press to meet their demands. That is the road to
hyperinflation, which Russians experienced as recently as 1992 (when, in December,
year-on-year inflation reached 2,500%), by which time they had seen their savings
vaporized.&quot; They have lost their savings twice during this period.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;...Russians had plenty to complain
about: a government so incompetent at collecting taxes that it could provide few services;
a payments system so constipated that soldiers, miners, teachers and a host of other
workers went without wages; appalling living standards even for those in work;
ill-equipped hospitals, overcrowded prisons...&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;If lending is now to resume, it must
only be on the strictest of terms&quot;. They are recommending it, in this case the
magazine is. &quot;That should mean explicit conditions about what the money is to be used
for --for instance, to guarantee small deposits in commercial banks. It should also mean
stern supervision of how it is spent, preferably by appointing foreigners to run the banks
in question.&quot;. In other words, the intervention of the banks, so that they can be
managed by foreigners. Look at this: &quot;Similar oversight over the tax and customs
service will have to be imposed if any support is to be given to the balance of
payment.&quot; The method used by the United States in the Dominican Republic in the
second decade of this century but to collect taxes: the intervention of customs.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;And if the Russians say no? Or, just
as likely; say yes but mean no? Then the West should also say no. The West has an interest
in promoting democracy and market economics in Russia, though it stands to lose much less
than the Russians themselves if these concepts fail to take root.&quot; It says that the
Russians would stand to lose more.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;It also has an interest in seeing a
country that remains infested with nuclear weapons peaceful and non-belligerent. But it
would be wrong to assume that it is in the West's power to bring all this about, certainly
not through economic assistance alone. The unfortunate truth is that Russia is condemned
by its own history and its own people, to a period of acute unhappiness: All happy
families resemble one another, Tolstoy might have written, but the Russian family is
unhappy in its own way. In the end it will be Russians, not foreigners, who bring its
period of misery to a close.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Look at the Western treatment at this
moment of supercrisis, they are about to do some crazy deed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I do believe that the Russians can be
saved, I do believe it, I am sure that they can be saved; but I am not saying a single
word, nobody has asked for my opinions, neither do we want to assume any responsibility.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Other articles follow, but I will just
mention brief phrases.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Another one, this one also from the same
magazine: <i>Russia's nightmare</i>.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Nothing about the measures taken this
week to deal with Russia's financial mess gives confidence about the country's future.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Another article: <i>A detour or a
derailment?</font></p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;A botched devaluation and a bond
default are likely to leave the struggling Russian economy in even worse condition.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The other one is entitled: <i>Collapse in
Russia</i>. Here the things they say about the president of the country are somewhat
insulting, and my intention is not to insult anybody, to offend anybody, but to inform and
reflect upon these problems a little.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">And another one, this time from the <b>New
York Times</b>. Its title: <i>Moscow Dashes American Illusions</i>. Subtitle: <i>Already
the question is being asked, &quot;Who lost Russia?&quot;</font></p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It seemed right to me to present these
ideas to you, even if abusing your energies. I warned you to have a good-night sleep
before coming (Laughter and applause).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If I were the lady that sang for us so
beautifully yesterday, and had a good voice and just a fairly good intonation, I would
sing a parody of a song I heard some years ago, which began something like this: &quot;How
far behind those times now seem&quot; and change it to &quot;How far behind those dreams
now seem&quot;. Yes, the dreams of those who had such illusions, of those who recommended
these neoliberal recipes, of those who destroyed that State, no matter what its
limitations or errors might have been; a State that had to be corrected, upgraded,
improved, but never destroyed (Applause).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now the West has taken possession of
everything, of the Caspian oil; it has introduced itself into all the fragmented former
USSR republics, into Kazakhstan, into Uzbekistan, into Azerbaiyan, into all those
peripheral countries. It has left the Russian army practically unarmed. They have not been
able to supply the armed forces with 20 state-of-the-art aircraft developed by Russian
technicians, not even 20 aircraft! </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">NATO with Poland joining it. It was assumed
that after the agreements whereby the Soviet troops were to withdraw from Eastern Europe,
there would not be a NATO expansion or anything like it. But right after that, NATO
expansion in Poland, NATO expansion in the Czech Republic, NATO expansion in Hungary, and
they are threatening to expand into Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, and even to Ukraine if
they can. Although, I think that in these difficult times, since the situation of Ukraine
worsens hand in hand with Russia's, there may be a better understanding between Ukraine
and Russia. But, at this rate NATO will soon reach the Kremlin walls.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A totally east-bound expansionist policy
inspired in bad faith has been applied. What need was there of this? Advancing with the
military apparatus where there used to be an army that was strategically on a par with it
--only strategically, mind you--, naval superiority and superiority in other branches, in
surface units, bases all over the world, they would favor whoever was against the Soviet
Union during the cold war. Nuclear strategic parity with the United States had been
achieved by the USSR, and now Russia can not even incorporate 20 aircraft to the country's
air force, even though they have all the necessary factories to build them in huge
quantities? History will be harsh in passing judgment to the culprits of this catastrophe,
of the humiliations, the scorn and the dangers that today threaten that people and the
world along with them.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What is, then, going to happen in that
country? And what if a <i>Yugoslavization</i> of Russia, full of nuclear weapons, takes
place? It is estimated that they have 20,000 such weapons. Would it not be a tragedy for
the world that that country should follow the same road as Yugoslavia, that that country
should be dissolved? Can such a thing be conceived? What consequences would it have?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">From the economic point of view, nothing
scares us. Who is better prepared than Cuba for any global economic crisis? It would
affect us, of course. If we have to halt the nickel plants, we halt them; if the price of
sugar continues to drop, we will withstand the low prices. We have been withstanding them
for a while now; we will see if it is compensated with the low prices of other items.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our land is in the hands of the people and
they will not be idle. What country is better organized and prepared than this? We do not
want that crisis, we consider it a tragedy, it is going to bring enormous suffering to the
world. In other words, it can be catastrophic. And the effects...</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They should be thinking in the United
States, and thinking it very well, about what will happen within the United States and how
the next elections will turn out, not the one coming up in a few days, the next one, if
the stock markets collapse and half of the Americans with shares in the stocksmarket lose
huge amounts of money.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Reading about the 1929 crisis one can see
how the stock brokers committed suicide one after another. Many millionaires would
committed suicide because they only had 100 million left. Suicides were daily routine at
the time of the 1929 collapse. And, as I said, only 5% of the US population had stocks
then. These were mainly owned by companies.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, these things are inevitably bound to
happen the way things are going. But, mind you, an economic crisis in Russia is one thing,
its <i>Yugoslavization</i> is another. A civil war in that country is something very, very
serious. And if I were to advise my enemies, I would tell them: &quot;You had better help
Russia. See where you can get the money, maybe by selling those bonds issued by the US
Treasury or by printing new bills. Save that country, prevent its disintegration.&quot;
That is what I would really recommend, and I am not charging them half a penny for the
recommendation. I am not doing it to favor the United States' interests, I am doing it for
the world. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I would also say to them: &quot;Entrench
yourselves also in South America prevent the crisis from spreading. Help the South
Americans, help them, because, otherwise, the fire will soon reach the US economy. Try to
understand.&quot; And they have to understand it. They cannot be so nearsighted, so
arrogant. They cannot continue squeezing the others until the very end. They cannot
suffocate Russia nor allow the crisis to spread to Brazil.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I will say more: even if they do this, the
only thing they will gain is to postpone the crisis for a time. It will come again and it
will become even worse. The IMF would have to explode, the whole financial system that has
been established. The economic order they have imposed would burst into pieces. They would
have to devise something that could save what it is possible to save of capitalism; but
the present situation is unsustainable. It must change. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They must certainly go quite a bit further
if they want to avoid an imminent catastrophe. An increasing number of people are already
calling for this. They can not continue insisting on the rules, the regulations, the
outrageous things they are demanding of governments and peoples. They are not neither
economically nor politically viable, and from the human point of view they are unbearable.
The developed capitalist world must inevitably pay a price. It must accept to distribute
part of the wealth it has accumulated throughout the centuries and some of the technology
it has developed. It must cut back the squandering of natural resources, the insulting and
irrational luxury. The more rationality and less selfishness.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have said very little, I mean that I have
only dealt with two or three topics. I have not even mentioned other problems that burden
and threaten the world, what for? What we must do now is face the economic catastrophe
that awaits us. There will be solutions. Do not ask me which. I am not a prophet, as I
said in the South African Parliament. I only say and repeat something with the most
absolute and deepest conviction: The greatest solutions have always emerged from the
greatest crises.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Sooner or later everything will have to
change. We are not seeking petty and narrow national interests. We have been withstanding
the worst of situations for quite a long time now. We have learned to defend ourselves, to
struggle, to achieve many things under extremely difficult circumstances.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We hope the world can be saved. The world
has no alternative, it must be saved, and it should save nature, from which the 10 billion
people that we will soon be will have to live. I know the way many politicians in the
world think, in Europe and everywhere, and many of them are even more anxious than we are
to do away with the world economic order that has been imposed on us, but not with our
freedom to express this desire.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Some of us have devoted some time to
delving deep into this matter, and we are going to have that meeting in January: 600
economists. Even the gentlemen from the British magazine mentioned several times here and
from others of renowned prestige are invited, those who defend neoliberalism and those who
oppose it. But no one knows what might happen from here to January. Anyway, we have to
gather information and follow the events. We will have debates, presentations and debates,
and a lot of people interested in the topic.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Also, as I told you in the Congress, Cuba
has been chosen to host the meeting of the Group of 77 made up of more than 120 countries
now. They are going to discuss all of these issues, which are matters of life or death for
our countries. But, we can also wonder what might happen from here to the year 2000. Many
things can happen! But first we have to prepare ourselves for the January meeting: five
days, it will be five days of intensive work as we have done in this Congress of the
Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, with one difference, that it will consist of
three sessions a day: morning, afternoon and evening, in this very same room. They are
going to be a little more comfortable than you are, because we only want 600 to come, so
that they feel more comfortable in those seats, without anybody seating behind them, so
that the invited economists and personalities can listen, meditate, take notes.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We do not want too many people to attend,
because we do not want a meeting like the one we held to discuss the foreign debt, in
which many personalities and sectors of our continent participated, a great battle that we
waged and that was not useless, for it helped to build awareness and to somewhat alleviate
the dramatic situation of the debtors.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today's economic situation presents a great
challenge: it is more serious and worse, really significant. Our January meeting acquires
utmost importance, from the theoretical and practical point of view.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our economists are very happy and
satisfied. They and the Association of Latin American Economists convoked the meeting. We
offered them all our help and support. It will be a meeting where a broad, deep and free
debate will take place between all the schools, those who defend certain theories and
those who think differently. This will be a good place to extensively discuss papers by
outstanding people and then, after each presentation, questions and comments. It is going
to be a great school for our economists and of great interest for politicians and
economists of many countries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This meeting was convened months before the
current situation, seeing these problems coming: Let's delve deep into these problems, we
said. Now, because of what is happening, there is even more reason for holding the
meeting. People are increasingly interested, and the truth is that we do not want a crowd.
If we were to accept everyone who wants to come, we would need to hold it in the
Revolution Square. The interest for such a vital and decisive topic is enormous and
continues to grow.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">For the meeting of the Group of 77, we are
going to be better prepared, because for that meeting the events must be followed very
closely, although some of the questions we have now will have been answered by then. For
now, since you like interesting movies or interesting serials, as everyone does, follow
this serial. I hope our press can be of service to you and, based on these topics that
have been presented, it can offer you some information; and if our press can not, Contino,
let's see if the press and some economists can help out and you send the resulting
material to the CDRs so that they are well informed (Applause), so that they know well
within what strategic framework their struggle will develop in the next few months and in
the next few years.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That should be all. I just want you to
excuse me for keeping you here for so long (Exclamations of approval and applause), and
thank you for not falling asleep (Exclamations). Yes, some of you dozed off, even I did in
one session, although I was generally wide awake, but it can happen! (Laughter.) So, I do
not criticize anybody for it. And, I say what we must say today stronger than ever: </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Socialism or Death!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Motherland or Death!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We will win!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">(Ovation)</font></p>
