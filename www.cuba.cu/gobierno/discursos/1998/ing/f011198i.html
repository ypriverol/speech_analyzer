<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Oficina de Publicaciones del Consejo de
Estado de la República de Cuba, calle 17 número 552, esquina a D, Vedado, La Habana,
Cuba</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">My very dear friend Don Manuel Fraga,
president of Galicia - some call him president of the Assembly and I call him president of
Galicia, I mean, within the Spanish state (<i>Applause</i>), but, as I see that autonomous
regions have growing strength, since it is something visible and recognized, I prefer to
call him president.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I also want to welcome the distinguished
personalities present here. I will even welcome in advance those arriving tonight and say
a farewell to the person leaving tonight, that is the Minister of Venezuela, who is here.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I welcome you all, exhibitors and guests.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have not come to discuss politics or the
blockade, droughts, hurricanes or calamities of any kind, because I take them for granted
(<i>Laughter</i>). I have come to share a few jokes with you, partly at the expense of the
words by our very dear and really highly appreciated Minister of Foreign Trade, without
blaming him at all for the torture that we have to go through here every year.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Sixteen exhibitions have been held since
they began in Cuba, the latest ones in this very same place, EXPOCUBA, and it is always
the same. We stand on this platform, listen to a speech, cut a ribbon; nobody knows how
long you have been waiting. Now, in view of the fact that this is growing year after year,
it will be necessary to change the concept of the opening ceremony: where it is held, how
it is done, and create a bit more comfort for the guests - it is cool today, fortunately -
for those who come here because, otherwise, your speech will have to be the same. (<i>He
looks at Ricardo Cabrisas, Minister of Foreign Trade.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am not criticizing him. He wants you to
invest (<i>Laughter</i>). That is why he talks about the boom in tourism and all the rest
and, yet, it is not necessary to exhort you to invest, simply because you really are going
to invest (<i>Laughter</i>). I do not mean it as a joke. It is a fact. You are going to
invest. You want to invest and our duty is to create the best possible conditions so that
you can invest. You want to invest here and in many places - and the countries that need
to develop argue and compete among themselves, not always in the most desirable way, for
those investment. We are aware of that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But, jokes aside, two or three serious
things can be said, which may contain elements for a certain optimism in the near future
of the world economy so seriously threatened at this time.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A few months ago, we visited Geneva - he
[Cabrisas] mentioned the WHO meeting but a WTO meeting also took place - and some of these
current problems were discussed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have just had an important meeting in
Portugal, in Oporto, a hospitable and beautiful city. The leaders were there from the
whole of Latin America which, as you all know very well, is the battlefield at the moment.
It could be for the West's economy a relative victory or a Waterloo. The risk of a serious
global economic crisis is an issue we have been closely following in Cuba, particularly
lately. They are events that we saw coming.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In the Oporto meeting, we were all very
clear about the dangers of a recession and something worse, because nobody knows what a
recession might become in today's world. We knew there that Latin America was the
battlefield where it would be decided if the economy could win a victory against the
headstrong advance of the crisis or sustain a great disaster worldwide. I say worldwide
and it is not an exaggeration because the economy has been internationalized, as some put
it, or globalized, as others put it, and increasingly so, apart from a load of further
problems that have been added to these phenomena, some of which have a history and are
known; others are new.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Everybody in that meeting was aware and the
Cuban delegation was very, very much aware of the fact that the near future would be
decided here in Latin America, beginning with Brazil, whatever would happen there and that
everything resulted from the economic crisis in your country, Kalinin (<i>He indicates the
ambassador of Russia</i>) though we shall avoid an analysis of the causes or blaming any
Russian or anything of the kind. Rather, I would put the blame on many of the advises
given to the Russians, who did not have much experience in the construction of capitalism.
</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The financial organizations and the new
Western friends arrived with their antediluvian prescriptions to apply in that country
which did not even get to know capitalism because it virtually went from feudalism to
socialism. Beginning with the latest Russian economic crisis - and everybody knows when it
happened; it was in the month of August - when it became very obvious and panic spread. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Dow Jones on Wall Street fell 512
points in one day, feeding the panic. The stock exchanges experienced sharp drops and it
was very clear that Brazil was the most vulnerable place at that moment and that a crisis
in Brazil was something that would inevitably spread to the rest of Latin America and
would truly, irremediably and clearly reach the United States stock exchanges; and that,
when that happened and the 50 percent of Americans who have savings, pension insurance and
everything invested there lost 50, 60, 70 or 80 percent of their stocks value in the stock
exchange, the disaster was going to be of the greatest dimensions, not even comparable to
the 1929 crisis. In our view, worse than that famous crisis.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So, it was clear that, in Brazil, there was
going to be a great battle. That was analyzed in Oporto. We expounded some ideas because
Cuba will host the next meeting. There was also the question of the topic which, as the
host country, we had to choose as the focus for that meeting. It was very sensitive
because, what will the situation be then? We thought about discussing what Latin America
is doing or how it is confronting the global economic crisis. We finally summarized it in
a single phrase: Ibero-America and the serious risks of a global economic crisis.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We set out from the idea that there are
still resources in the world. The West and Japan still have a lot of resources to hold
back the crisis for a time, nobody knows yet for how long; they could postpone it, or they
could even reflect more thoroughly, more in depth, on the economic order and the kind of
globalization imposed on the world, and try to find, as something unavoidable, a bit more
of tranquillity, calm and peace for all countries. In other words, in choosing a topic for
our meeting, we had to be very careful because it remains to be seen what will happen in
the next 12 months.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We mentioned there Clinton's speech of the
14th September at the United States Council on Foreign Relations, the importance attached
to the meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, the invitation to all the reserve bank
governors to meet there in Washington. There were obvious signs of the realization by the
United States, or by some in the United States, several key leaders included, of the risks
of a really serious crisis.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">On the 5th and 6th of October last, the
chairman of the International Monetary Fund and the president of the World Bank gave very
interesting speeches in which differences, criticisms and antagonisms could be seen
between the policeman role of one institution and the Good Samaritan role of the other;
one in search of a more restrictive and rigorous order and the other trying to think of
how to alleviate the social problems that these crises entail. In other words, there was
already some interesting movement in the month of October and our meeting took place just
a few days later in Oporto.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It was necessary to try to foresee what the
situation would be next year and what we would be discussing. It was not easy to adopt a
topic. We limited ourselves to this, I repeat: Ibero-America and the serious risks - not
to take it for certain - of a global economic crisis.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We assumed that, here in Cuba, it would be
necessary to make an analysis of everything that would have to happen in the course of a
year that was still ahead of us. Nobody could venture one thing or another.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There again, we discussed whether it was
correct or not to speak of a global crisis, given that, in the United States, there was
not a crisis yet nor was there one in Europe.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">For some of us, it was clear that it was
becoming global, on the basis of what would happen; that Brazil and Latin America were the
last defense - as we said on the 28th of September this year - where the United States
could defend itself from a situation that would directly affect it. It would no longer be
something of interest only to Latin America but also to the United States, which is the
greatest economic power, has the greatest resources and a leadership role in the world
economy. Europe is not yet strong enough to play a similar role to that of the United
States, although it does have an important role to play.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So, it was necessary to be wary when trying
to foresee what we would be discussing a year from now. But, no doubt, it would be
necessary to analyze the international economic situation. This will continue to be the
key issue.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We were saying that there are signs,
Cabrisas, and a lot can be said about that. Maybe it will give them more encouragement to
invest. There are some elements of interest. These guests are in our country and more of
them have come than ever before. The numbers are there. You mentioned some and Maciques
mentioned others to us. This is the biggest of all the fairs that have been held in Cuba.
There is no longer enough space. All the indicators are very positive: the presence of a
lot of countries; the extensive presence of Europe; that of Japan, for the first time. So,
there is a growing participation despite the threat of a crisis. That indicates the
investors traditional interest and impatience to invest.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Perhaps one of the current problems in the
world is the excess haste to invest and, above all, to invest where it seemed that the
profits were going to come faster, in the United States stock exchanges.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Europe is not yet competing with you so
much. (<i>He looks toward the ambassador of Canada.</i>) Well, the Canadians still have
significant resources. They are industrialized neighbors of the United States in a good
economic situation. Investors are also going to buy stocks or bonds from Europe, mainly
when there are some massive flights of capital from the Third World. But, in the United
States especially, everybody was buying stocks because their prices were rising like a
hot-air balloon, similar to the situation in 1929.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A lot of it is speculative investment,
really. The world has become a big casino. We feel much more respect for those who invest
in the places, in a service, an industry, who invest in a certain branch of the economy.
Speculative investment could be the great Russian roulette of the world economy. Tens of
millions of people are making their bets in the United States. Almost everybody is
involved. Money desperately seeking for money, absolutely disconnected from commercial or
economic development.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In general, those who come here to exhibit
their industrial products are not usually making bets. It might be that some do bet from
time to time, that they buy some share in the stock exchanges of other countries but,
really, in Cuba, they come to trade or invest.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Speculation has nothing to do with the real
economy. I can say that all those present here have to do with the real economy, with the
production of tangible goods and services, with commercial exchange and, really, we feel
respect for such investors.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But, what is happening now after all that
happened in Oporto? Several positive things. First, it was indicated, for example, that
the Japanese took measures to restructure their banking system, something that will
benefit the economy in the countries of South-East Asia, obviously. They decided to invest
500 billion dollars, although it is known that the bad loans amount to almost one
trillion. That step taken by the Japanese is a positive sign for the world economy. It
does not mean that their problems are solved. They still have a load of difficulties to
overcome.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Second, another piece of news that had a
positive effect on the international economic climate: the data related to the United
States growth in the third quarter. The first quarter of this year was around 5 percent.
The second fell to less than 3 percent. In the third, they were calculating two point
something, if I remember correctly, 2.6 or 2.7 percent, and now the news, 48 hours ago, of
3.3 percent in the third quarter. That encouraged some stock exchanges which badly needed
encouragement, because the remedy against panic is hope, confidence. That is what the
doctors in economics prescribe from the viewpoint of the capitalist system.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Third piece of news: the rigorous program,
truly an austerity program, a savings program, not just to reduce the budget deficit but
also with the aim of achieving a surplus in Brazil's budget. The measures taken by
Brazil's government also breathed a certain encouragement, a certain optimism into the
United States stock exchanges.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The last thing, what has strengthened the
hope and calm at the very worried stock exchanges, is the G7 agreement. The Senate had
finally approved, with a series of very questionable strings attached, the 18 billion
[dollars] that the United States had to contribute to the IMF. The G7 countries, as a
whole, have undertaken to inject 90 billion dollars into the world economy to avoid
catastrophes, to try to prevent them or to run and put out the fire. But they are already
thinking a bit more in terms of preventing the fire and not having to put it out, which is
always more expensive.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Those four pieces of news are elements from
the last few days that have raised a little the hopes and enthusiasm in the stock markets.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I think that one of the most important
things is the growing awareness in the United States - the administration in the first
place, and the Treasury and the US Federal Reserve System. This last institution, which
hardly a few weeks ago, was planning to raise the interest rates had now decided to reduce
them by 0.25 percent and some days later, another 0.25 percent. It now amounts to 0.5
percent. That was another positive sign that could be added to those previously mentioned
and which introduced a certain optimism internationally. Most of the members of the United
States Federal Reserve, up to the Russian crisis and its rapid and unforeseen
consequences, were in favor of raising the interest rates for fear of inflation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In the speech of 14th September, which I
mentioned before, Clinton states clearly that the grave danger for the world economy is of
a recession and not of inflation. That was another positive sign in the dangerous
situation created. In other words, there has been a certain change of concept. I consider
it positive, as a sign of awareness about the not so idyllic realities of today's world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As for the International Monetary Fund, you
only need to read the articles published in all the economic magazines in the world. They
are now saying awful things about the IMF. It is really a moment of a true crisis in
public relations. The World Bank, on the other hand, has raised its stocks in this field,
with its director&#146;s speech in that meeting on the 6th October in Washington.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In that same meeting, Clinton spoke once
more, confirming what he had said on the 14th September. It is obviously a complete
turnabout which has happened in a matter of weeks.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The danger, gentlemen, is recession and not
inflation, Clinton has decidedly admitted it. In essence, a criterion, a thesis that has
forced its way through.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A second idea was strongly in evidence in
that meeting: the International Monetary Fund must have a more flexible policy; it must
change, it must be restructured.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is a widespread opinion that the
International Monetary Fund has become a major agent of subversion and destabilization in
the world. Wherever it arrived, it ruined the economy. To begin with, it arrived late,
then it ruined the economy and it ruined the governments. It had to be a bit self-critical
there and recognize that, of course, more flexibility was required.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Will they go so far as to try to mend this
world? I do not really think so. I was convinced that they had enough room to maneuver.
Reducing interest rates and injecting money into the world economy was the least they
could do, faced with such an obvious catastrophe.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What will happen afterward? We will have to
watch closely. How far will the changes go? There is talk of a new financial architecture.
What will the new architecture consist of? A country in trouble cannot be helped by
putting it in crisis, destabilizing it, destroying its economy and throwing tens of
millions of people to go hungry in the streets.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At the Washington meeting, important
leaders of the world economy sounded like Marxists when they talked to the world. They
themselves were bringing up the data - in Indonesia, so many millions in the streets and
going hungry; the idyllic middle class, which they say they had been creating with so much
effort, destroyed in a few minutes, going hungry, selling their homes; an end had come to
the car sales and to a lot of other things that all those countries were producing. A
disaster, really! A true disaster! And with serious international consequences.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They admitted, in figures and details, what
was taking place and they said that could not go on. They understood, they were sensible.
They at least reasoned sensibly. How far can they go in that reasoning and apply measures
to palliate the chronic and growing poverty? I frankly say that there are things that can
be palliated. They can slow down, put off the arrival of a very serious crisis. But, we
are deeply convinced that while other concepts are not drawn up and applied that can
really guarantee the general well-being and the very survival of the human species, the
same problems will again reappear with additional complications each time.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If those in the New York Stock Exchange get
too excited about all this, then it will happen that the Dow Jones, which was at 8,000 and
something today, will get to 9,000, then reach 10,000 and even go from 10,000 to 12,000
and the madness causing the debacle will be reproduced to a greater degree, the already
famous currency speculation, which comes to one trillion [dollars] a day and which some
say rises to 1.3 trillion or 1.8 trillion, an absolutely new phenomenon in the world, to
which are added fabulous figures from speculative operations with shares and other kinds
of securities. That will increase.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They are talking about regulations. For
now, they are talking about an ethic that would regulate capital movement. They are even
talking about some light controls and things like that, something so that the others do
not run around in absolute freedom doing all the kinds of stupid things done by those who
have accumulated a large amount of funds and experience and who devote themselves
exclusively to speculation. They have even dared to say some words against the worldwide
speculators. Well, that is already something. Before, no-one could talk about that because
whoever did was immediately condemned to hell, just for suggesting some control over that
kind of operations.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are those who talk about collecting
some funds by setting a small tax on speculative operations. A Nobel Laureate, honored 15
or 20 years ago - I think it was [James] Tobin [winner of the prize for Economic Sciences
in 1981] - proposed the idea of charging a modest tax on such harmful and disorderly
activities. At the time he proposed that, in 1985, currency-speculation operations
involved 150 billion dollars a year. Just 13 years ago!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At this moment - I cannot speak about the
month of September - in the middle of 1998, they have risen to at least one trillion, and
not per year but per day.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">One analyst estimated that the 1 percent
tax suggested by Tobin would produce around 800 billion dollars every year and he proposed
that one half be dedicated to the countries that collected the tax and the other half to
the poor countries or emerging countries, as they are sometimes politely called, to assist
in their development. It is not a bad idea but it remains to be seen whether the masters
of the world economy would find it acceptable. In substance, we are faced with a very
serious, a very grave phenomena, a lot of unknown factors, a lot of questions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, we do not belong to the IMF or
the World Bank or the Inter-American Development Bank. Nobody gives us a loan. Nobody
gives us anything - no long-term credit, over so many years, as they gave Haiti and quite
rightly so. I read it in the cables and it was confirmed to me by Iglesias, the director
of the Inter-American Bank, in Oporto. They granted Haiti 91 million dollars, 40 years
with 10 years' grace, 2 or 3 percent interest, actually a gift. Anyway, that should be the
role of the international financial organizations, it must be done and it is only right
that they do it if they really want to solve a lot of serious problems in the world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As for us, let the hurricanes come. I have
already said that we take them for granted. We take the blockade for granted. We take the
drought for granted. El Niño is already a well-known phenomenon affecting many places. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">However, we do not receive any of that nor
do we base our plans on the possibility of receiving any of that. We do our calculations
fundamentally on the basis of the reliability of our work, our efficiency, the real
advantages and the confidence of those investing in our country, generally in association
with our national companies.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We cannot wish for a disaster in the world
economy. It would not be ethical. Not even the most radical revolutionary would have the
right to wish that the problems in this global world, where six billion people now live,
be solved by a disaster, even when we know that oftentimes in human history, great
disasters have been followed by the great remedies. There must be other alternatives at
this stage of history. It is at least a moral duty to consider them.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Clinton himself - who, some weeks ago, was
not generally concerned about the international economy; he never thought about that much,
concentrated as he was, almost exclusively, on the interests and the economy of his own
country, which now finds itself seriously threatened by what is happening in the world;
very much held back, too, in his domestic and foreign plans by the extreme right of the
Republican majority in Congress - began giving serious thought to the matter and so did
his team from the Treasury Department and those from the Federal Reserve System. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Everybody did when they perceived the
problem so near and so serious. That is the truth. The capitalist world only moves when
faced with crises or the approach of great crises. It is still very far from rationality
and reality.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We hold another very different conception
and perception of reality. We prefer that the world's problems be solved on rational
basis, on the basis of reason, discussion, debate and dialogue. Next January, we will host
an important meeting in Cuba with many outstanding economists from very diverse countries
in attendance. We intend to discuss these problems for five days with the participation of
representatives of all the schools of economic thought, as we are persuaded of the need to
study the issue deeply, to develop and disseminate ideas.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, the threat of a global crisis
has already changed minds and the memory of 1929 has returned like a ghost. Everybody has
been recalling that ill-fated date and discovering that what happened then on the stock
exchange was almost exactly the same as what is happening today - stock values rising and
rising; commodity prices plummeting. That is how the conditions for a catastrophe began to
be created. Despite the fact that there already existed the Federal Reserve System, which
they have called to account. They have accused it basically of not having then taken the
measures in time.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, we prefer problems to be debated,
studied in depth, discussed and solved and not for there to be crises, which bring
calamities and dreadful consequences for billions of people, unthinkable sacrifices for
billions of people, many of whom, almost one billion, were already going hungry at the
time of the world economy boom. It is absolutely necessary that man uses his intelligence
and his rational to find solutions to such dramatic problems.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have mentioned some positive indicators
which might even remove risks in the near future.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Notice that, despite the already mentioned
dangers of a crisis, the participants had decided to bring their stands here, to take part
in this fair. I think that, now, they deserve all the more to be told by us: Gentlemen,
there are some rather good news and there are some hopes. This is a better time than a few
months ago to invest and to do business. That is a fact.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, nothing else can be said but
that there are hopes, possibilities, changes in ideas and conceptions; certain perceptions
in those who hold in their hands the key to the fundamental resources of the world's
economy, those who can curb, delay or precipitate a major crisis.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They must be grateful to you, Kalinin. (<i>He
indicates the ambassador of Russia.</i>) That is why I think that the Russians have the
right to request and to demand aid from the great advisers - not to blackmail, that is not
the idea - to tell them: &quot;Look, we have followed your advice; these are the
consequences. Do not ask us now to cut our budgets again and, instead of six months behind
in wage payments to be 12 months behind.&quot; Nobody can put up with that. It is
impossible. They cannot simply go to Russia with the demands they have been making of
everybody else.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is clear to me, from my tiny bit of
experience in political strategy and tactics, that you [Russians] are in a strong
position, like Brazil, because now it is not just a matter of helping to save others but,
more than anything, of helping to save themselves, which comes first. They cannot demand
of the Russians more sacrifices that turn out to be absolutely impossible.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are following very closely every word
said and everything done there every day and I really see courage in the new Russian
leadership. I see steadfastness and a sound rational combined with resiliency. They are
not putting forward formulas without any alternatives: we are willing to do this and that
because it is possible; but not this or that because it is impossible, they say.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Yesterday, the cables were reporting that,
in the month of September, Russia had collected 812 million dollars in taxes for the
budget and it was more than in October. Eight hundred twelve million dollars for the
largest country in the world, with 140 million population, great industrial and scientific
development, nuclear weapons by the thousands, almost endless borders, trains that need to
cover thousands of kilometers as the main system of domestic transportation, all of that.
Anyone understands that it is impossible to sustain life in such a country with 812
million dollars a month or with a billion dollars in tax revenue.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Portugal raises more than a billion dollars
a month for its budget, possibly twice or thrice that amount. Just think what can be asked
from an enormous country like Russia with less than a billion dollars in revenue. The
world cannot remain indifferent to the tragedy of that great state. What is more, the
world's problems cannot be solved if Russia's problems are not solved, because political
events and catastrophes might arise that would have enormous repercussions in the world's
economy and politics. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am not charging you for this advice,
Kalinin. (<i>Laughter.</i>) Nobody asked me, but I can assure you that my advice is more
selfless and possibly more objective than that given by the IMF people and many other
experts from the United States and the West. Now, we give the IMF this advice: Listen, let
go of a little of that 90 billion and send it to Russia. Let them discuss other things if
they want, but no more cuts to the budget. Other issues can be discussed, but not the kind
of conditions that are ruinous, disastrous and destabilizing.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A leadership is gaining ground in the
government which enjoys wide support in the Duma. A series of circumstances and mere
common sense should advise the United States, the IMF and everybody else to send part of
those funds to Russia. They cannot forget Russia. They cannot afford it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today, I read a news that they had decided
on some food aid. Well, I am ahead of you, Kalinin, if you have not read the cables. It is
from four to six million tons of wheat, a loan on lenient terms. You are very lucky. They
do not even sell us a kilogram of food, let along offering us a loan, whether hurricanes
come or not, whether droughts come or not. But that is good news for you - from four to
six million tons of wheat. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our only concern is that it not be so much
that it will increase the price of the wheat we have to import, so that we would have to
spend our scarce hard currency to pay for a more expensive wheat in the world market. Two
things alarm us: the one I just mentioned and the other if the floods in China require the
import of grain, rice and other things because that could be a real headache for us,
countries of the Third World, that import many of those grains that we cannot produce
ourselves.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They have also said that part of that aid
of four to six million [tons] will be humanitarian aid, in other words, free of charge.
They did not say how much. Are they not &quot;very kind&quot;? They really must do it. But
it is not enough, far from it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I say here very frankly, as I always do,
that they cannot forget Russia. Of course, they cannot forget Brazil either. They are not
going to forget Brazil. They are obviously not going to forget it. That is certain now,
because it is the last defense to stop the advance of the crisis before it directly pounds
the United States stock markets. Latin America absorbs one third of their exports and a
significant portion of their bank loans and investment are sited there. That is not the
case with Russia.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Logically, Brazil has been given a
priority. The situation of the Brazilian economy is a lot less critical than Russia's.
They believe that they can solve it with 30 billion dollars, which remains to be seen.
Mexico needed 50 billion; South Korea 100 billion. Brazil might very well need the 90
billion from the G7 and a lot more. Brazil's negotiating position is strong for the same
reason that I was explaining before, because helping Brazil means protecting the rest of
Latin America from the crisis; helping Brazil means the United States helping itself and
all the West helping itself. Brazil's position is, therefore, very strong and when
someone's position is strong, responsibility is called for.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So, I am not suggesting that a privileged
strategic position should be used to be irresponsible, to stop making one's own best
efforts with the greatest seriousness and efficiency. But, being strong in a situation
like this makes it possible to negotiate acceptable conditions that do not destabilize the
country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In Brazil, the president has just been
re-elected with over 50 percent of the votes. He has a good domestic situation, but
serious political difficulties may be created for him - great resistance by parliament, by
the federal governments, by the social sectors. The problems he must face are not easy.
But, I repeat, Russia and Brazil have a strong negotiating position.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am about to finish now. You must be tired
from standing there (<i>Laughter</i>). The news is for you, not for me. I am not asking
for anything from you, simply trying to make predictions and revealing some easily
discovered secrets, talking freely, very freely. I think that, since we are the blockaded
country, since we are the country that does not receive anything from any of those
organizations controlled by the United States, we are the country with the greatest
freedom to speak clearly about what is going on. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">On the other hand, there is nothing secret
in this world, even the small talk over breakfast among the great personalities of world
finances, what one of them thinks and what the other thinks is spread throughout the
world. There is no need for spies, far from it. There are many assistants and experts
taking part. They all have many friends everywhere and they tell them what they talked
about over breakfast, over lunch and elsewhere, to journalists, experts, economists and
colleagues; and what [Alan] Greenspan thinks, what Rubin said, Summers&#146; views, that
is, the Undersecretary of the Treasury Department, and the point of view of Fischer,
second in command at the International Monetary Fund, and what their concerns are. Nothing
is a secret.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have the freedom to talk, to explain, to
reason and it is a freedom that, I swear to you, we would like to preserve forever. Many
countries are hanging on some loan or another and cannot take the liberty of speaking as
clearly as this about problems.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am trying to help Cabrisas, who wants you
to invest, and I am telling him: They will invest if we do what we have to do, because
they are eager to invest and there is now perhaps an opportunity to alleviate the crisis
in the world economy, at least in the Latin American and Caribbean region. This is a hope
not only for those who want to invest here but also for those who have invested in other
parts of Latin America. Don&#146;t you think? </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Anybody with an investment in Brazil, in
Argentina or anywhere else must be glad there is a possibility that a disaster or a crash
might not take place there as in South-East Asia. I know that many of you have business in
many of our countries. This panorama that can be glimpsed right now is good for the
investors of any country and it is also good for your investors, Fraga, and for the
hundreds of thousands of your fellow citizens who are spread throughout Latin America.
That hope is not bad news for them either.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What we have to do, really, is try to
change the format, how we can make this ceremony a bit more comfortable. We have to come
up with something. Secondly, we have to expand.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I remember perfectly a few years ago, it
will soon be ten years, there were misunderstandings and criticism at the expenditure,
which was not really high, when we were building this center, with the enthusiastic help
of voluntary construction workers, for a permanent exhibition center of our national
industry. It continues to play that role, but it immediately began to be used for
international exhibitions as well. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The first exhibitions were held in the
International Convention Center and its surroundings. A bulldozer and a crane were
exhibited by the Convention Center. From there, we moved over here and, now, we are
lacking in space. What does this mean? That we have to expand this exhibition center,
which is also visited by hundreds of thousands of people every year and whose total
investment was recovered in a short time. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have to create more exhibition space to
meet the increasing international demand. Fortunately, there's land for enlarging this
center. But the number of countries and firms looking forward to exhibit their products
grow every year. And I am sure that it is going to continue growing. It depends on us.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are our own International Monetary Fund,
our own World Bank, our own Inter-American Development Bank. Our country is all that. So,
with hard work and great difficulties, we have learned to be austere, to fight against
anything that deviates from this austerity - a tireless fight against any shortcoming,
waste or improper use of resources and, of course, stricter control over those resources
and a reduction in the price of what we purchase or import.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Every year, you will discuss matters with
better trained and more experienced cadres, who are going to argue more with you over
every penny they spend, whether it is on machinery or commodities. You understand that it
is our duty to do this so that the economy can continue to develop and economic and social
investment can continue to grow, be it national, joint-venture or strictly of foreign
capital. It is through our efforts, our sacrifices that we get the resources for the part
that we contribute to that development, which remains the fundamental part.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, it also suits us, it is in our
interests and not just for ethical reasons as I have explained, that any catastrophe be
avoided although, one way or another, we are used to struggling against great odds. I
think that we're better prepared than any other country to face up to difficulties. That
is why the modest fruits of our efforts, our growth, although modest, have been gradually
gained and will continue to be gained. I believe that, at a certain point in time, it will
be possible to appreciate qualitative changes, very visible changes in the efficiency of
our cadres, advances in our experience, absolute and total security for the investors who
have trusted in our country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We did not need the IMF to come and tell us
what to do with the repatriation of profits because we had already decided how to do that
from the moment we decided to accept foreign investment for our development - and it was
before the collapse of the USSR - as a supplement to our development, which was partly
based on Soviet technology, credits and supplies.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Nevertheless, throughout the years of the
Revolution, whenever it was possible and convenient, we purchased Western technology,
machinery, equipment and input for our national companies. So far, we are pleased with the
result of foreign capital participation in investments in our country, with the
cooperation and experience contributed by foreign companies in the administration of
economic centers and in the production and marketing of goods and services. We do not need
any advise on the repatriation of profits, because they are automatic, absolutely
unrestricted.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The problem of repatriation - and there are
now discussions on whether measures need to be taken, whether incomes must wait or be
frozen for a time - is something we completely solved from day one. Here, the repatriation
of profits has been, is and will continue to be unrestricted, automatic. We have not
stopped thinking the same way and that has not prevented us from considering ourselves
socialists. For us, socialism is the country's development, economic development, social
development, equitable and fair distribution of the country's wealth.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are happy to have such good
comrades-in-arms as Mr. Wolfenshon, director of the World Bank, even when the last word
will be said by those with the absolute power of veto in that institution, that is, the
United States. Read his speech of the 6th of October and do not panic, he has not declared
himself to be a Marxist-Leninist. What we say is that we can subscribe to many of the
concepts that he expressed that day.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In summary, our revolutionary and truly
socialist conception is perfectly compatible with the idea of foreign investment and the
utmost possibilities, guarantees and security for those who invest in our country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We can promise you honesty. We can promise
you that no minister, no high-ranking official in our country will approach you or
negotiate with you requesting or accepting a commission or a bribe. I say this
categorically. And if this ever occurred, it is your duty to report it directly to those
of us who hold the highest responsibility. Obviously, I cannot vouch for all of my fellow
citizens in an absolute way, but I tell you that we can vouch for those with a decision
power.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have decentralized certain activities.
It was essential. There are many people in a great variety of activities - also due to the
individual or almost individual nature of a great number of these activities - who come
into contact with those green bills, which are the worst poison, the worst vector of vice
and moral sickness the world has known. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It used to be gold, but gold weighed a lot
and could hardly be carried around. It was assumed that one of those bills represented a
certain amount of gold. Now, it does not represent anything. It is a piece of paper
printed in a printing press. But, it has a purchasing power due to historical reasons and
the overriding economic need for an instrument of exchange, which has been abused and is
abused to absurd levels by the hegemonic power that prints it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are a lot of people who handle it and
we are not unaware that there is always a risk with a lot of those who handle money.
However, I can assure you that the main decisions of economic policy, the main decisions,
are adopted at levels where you will never find a person who can be bribed. We know that
the cries of protest and complaint are universal about something called corruption - more
widely spread throughout the world than malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and other diseases put
together - against which no country is immune. The Revolution has struggled hard and will
continue to struggle hard for the idea and the value of honesty. That much I can promise
you.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have told you what I wanted to tell you.
That way, you will be able to better interpret Cabrisas words. Do not force him to come
here every year to give the same speech, one that is five pages long. Every year, he has
to talk about how tourism is faring, how it is growing and how nickel production has
increased. Everybody knows that production increased but the price fell and that all
commodities&#146; prices have fallen. They show very low indexes: copper, aluminum, tin.
Gentlemen, even the gold price, has fallen.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Canadians do not like that in the
least. (<i>He looks at the Canadian ambassador again.</i>) They do a lot of gold trade in
different places, prospecting and contracts on gold. Because gold is now hardly used even
as a financial reserve. Today, it is practically a metal used to make jewelry and for some
other purposes. Fewer governments still keep some gold in their reserves. Many have sold
it or have reduced its volume in the central banks, significantly affecting prices.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So the product prices are falling but, if a
new surge of economic growth comes, then that nickel, whose production we've kept
profitable, despite everything, at less than 3,900 and less than 3,800 dollars a ton; that
same nickel, which has sometimes had a price of 8,000 and 9,000 dollars, is still
profitable. At least, it covers the costs. There is no need to halt production, even at
its current very low price. If the world economy improves, the price of nickel and other
export items will undoubtedly improve.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Let us prepare for next year. Think
something up. Find seats. We have Fraga standing over there, although he is really strong.
Do not go thinking that he is paid heed to the years. He fulfills incredible programs. It
seems like he is not very well loved by those who organize such programs or it might be
that they love him so much that they sometimes come close to killing him.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Two ideas have been proposed - to organize
ceremonies that are more comfortable for those present, so that the issues can be analyzed
in depth and the content of the welcome can be varied, without leaving out essential
indexes and data; and to begin to plan for the enlargement of this exhibition center. You
need space. Also, more parking space is required. At the rate you're going, you'll end up
parking the cars over by 100th Street and with a bicycle service to get from there to
here, because I have seen cars everywhere at the side of the highway, as it is to be
expected with the presence of almost 3,000 participants, exhibitors and other accredited
people.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is what I can say.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I beg your forgiveness. I repeat that I
will not charge you anything for the good news and the advice. Actually, I'm speaking from
an optimistic and well substantiated perspective. Let us hope that nothing happens, out of
the many possible political and economic events or mistakes, that might prevent a
favorable and desirable development of the world economy in the near future.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thank you very much (<i>Prolonged applause</i>).</font></p>
