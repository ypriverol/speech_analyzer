<p ALIGN="center"><strong><font face="Arial" size="3">SPEECH BY COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF FIDEL
CASTRO TO THE MASS RALLY AT MANDELA PARK, KINGSTON, JAMAICA, JULY 30, 1998</font></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Honorable Prime Minister of Jamaica,
P.J. Patterson;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Honorable Mayor of Kingston;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Distinguished Guests;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">People of Jamaica:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I must try-although I do not always
succeed-to be brief (<i>Laughter</i>) but after such beautiful songs, such excellent
dances, such friendly words offering me the key to the city, and then the warm and
generous speech of our brother Patterson, considering the time and the hour, I should
reduce by about four-fifths the things I would like to say here. (<i>From the crowd
someone shouts &quot;All night!&quot;</i>) (<i>Laughter.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">First of all I would like to say that I am
really moved. In the first place, I am impressed by the noble person whose picture
presides over this rally, that brilliant and extraordinary leader, a real fortress who in
27 years never surrendered and never wavered, a symbol of freedom for Africa and the
world: Nelson Mandela (<i>Shouts and applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am also moved by the noble words
expressed about our people and their selfless and altruistic efforts in the struggle
against apartheid.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Things were said here about our nation and
our people inspired by this struggle which really accelerated, let us say, hastened the
end of apartheid. I say this because apartheid could not last forever, and it would not
have lasted forever. But it had to be contended and it had to be defeated as soon as
possible (<i>Applause</i>), as one of the greatest outrages inflicted on humanity.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Cuba's efforts have been mentioned but
there are many other things I must say about Jamaica's efforts.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I would like to recall that Cuba was the
last Spanish colony to obtain its independence at the end of the past century;
furthermore, we were not able to really obtain that independence because, after our heroic
30-year struggle, the country had to suffer the intervention of a powerful neighbor which
interfered when the colonial troops were exhausted and occupied it for four years. When
they finally conceded us our alleged independence, they imposed an amendment to our
Constitution-known as the Platt Amendment- giving the United States the right to interfere
with Cuba's internal affairs and the right to possess coal bases; finally, they occupied
one of the major bays in our country-almost facing Jamaica-and they turned it into a naval
base: the Guantánamo Naval Base, a portion of our land and our waters they still occupy,
as of this year, precisely a century later.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Jamaica and Cuba have waged very similar
struggles. The first to arrive in both Cuba and Jamaica were the Spanish. The Spanish
occupied this island about 140 or 150 years. You might still be speaking Spanish, which
would be better for me, to be able to speak to you in the same language (<i>Laughter</i>);
but the English stayed here about 300 years, so the language they left you was English.
That's not bad, it's not bad that Jamaica and Cuba can speak Spanish and English, English
and Spanish. It shows that languages do not separate and cannot separate peoples (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I can cite an example: our South African
brothers asked us to send a few hundred medical doctors and now there are about 400 Cuban
doctors there. They studied English and they were tested in English but they were sent to
the villages of South Africa where the doctors who graduated under apartheid do not go
with their medical knowledge and nobody speaks English in those villages. So our doctors
quickly learned the dialect and they understand each other perfectly, they and those
citizens who know no language other than their own dialect.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The difference in languages does not
prevent cooperation as shown in Patterson's remarks about the cooperation you provide us,
and in a sense we also provide you, in the field of dancing. The possibility of
cooperation exists in many fields, independent of language.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was saying that our histories have been
very similar. When the indigenous population was exterminated working in the gold mines or
as slaves in the fields, the colonialists, in their insatiable greed, went after the
Africans whom they captured and transported to this hemisphere to be enslaved. Such a
horrible crime: fathers taken away from their children, from their wives; children
forcibly separated from their parents, human beings violently torn from their families and
villages to carry them in shackles thousands of miles away. That was what slavery meant.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In other words, the discovery of America
and the conquest of this hemisphere was accompanied by the revival of slavery, something
which belonged to centuries past, to Greek and Roman times.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Twelve million Africans, according to
conservative estimates, were snatched from that continent and used here as slaves, doing
the hardest, most unbearable work and in the most inhumane conditions conceivable. They
were brought mainly to the Caribbean, the southern United States and Brazil, twelve
million of them.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, what does history tell us? That the
first to fight for freedom and independence in this hemisphere were the African slaves (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is well known in history that the first
independent nation in the years following the French Revolution was Haiti, the result of a
slave uprising; Haitian slaves defeated one of the best military leaders and one of the
boldest armies of Napoleon Bonaparte. But, in 1760, even before the slave uprising in
Haiti-more than thirty years earlier-there were slave revolts in Jamaica. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I don't remember any similar episode in
history, and it is very good to recall it to understand the sources of the independence
and freedom we defend today. (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Again, in 1795, important slave uprisings
took place in Jamaica. Moreover, the freed slaves of Haiti made a considerable
contribution to the independence of South America.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The independence wars of South America
began around 1912, led initially by Miranda and, along with Miranda, a brilliant and
gifted young man named Simón Bolívar (<i>Applause</i>). Miranda and Simón Bolívar were
defeated by the colonial forces, the former sent to England as a prisoner, the latter
leaving Venezuela and returning victorious shortly thereafter to re-establish the
republic, but the emancipation of slaves had not been decreed yet.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Likewise, in the United States, the
Declaration of Independence was proclaimed in 1776, as recalled today by a group of
friends. In the Constitution it reads that it is a self-evident truth that all men are
born with a right to freedom and equality -I'm not quoting literally. We hold, they said,
that all human beings are born free and equal, and all are endowed by the Creator with
certain rights, etc., etc., etc.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I used this paragraph in my defense at the
trial in Moncada to set forth the principle of the inalienable rights of every human being
and our right to rebel against oppression and tyranny (<i>Applause.</i>) Nevertheless, it
wasn't until 1860, almost a century later, that, in the midst of a violent war, the
emancipation of the slaves in the United States was proclaimed. Until then they were not
considered free and equal, they were not even considered human beings. And we all know the
consequences of slavery which still persist in that country, more than a century after
formal emancipation. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Again, I say that the Jamaicans showed the
course, and the freed slaves of Haiti helped Bolívar-the Liberator of the Americas. They
supplied him with weapons, and moreover, they raised the problem of slavery, they asked
Bolívar to free the slaves in Venezuela and the rest of Latin America. This was taking
place between 1812 and 1820.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, as a result of the struggles by
Jamaicans and Haitians, the English, as early as 1807-if my memory doesn&#146;t fail
me-suspended the traffic, what they called the slave trade, and in 1834 proclaimed
emancipation; the same you will be celebrating on August 1, very close to that other
historical date, August 6, Jamaican Independence Day (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But the suspension of slave trade and the
emancipation of slavery by the English was no accident, it was related to the heroic
struggles of the slaves in Jamaica, and the slaves in Haiti and other Caribbean islands.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am not going to speak here-for it was
already recalled by one of the artists-of what continued to happen after emancipation, but
I would like to tell you one thing: while slavery was legally abolished in Jamaica, it
remained in Cuba. Do you know when slavery was abolished in Cuba? Half a century after the
abolition of slavery in Jamaica, actually fifty-two years later! In our country slavery
existed until 1886 when it was abolished, removed, after a long heroic war by Cubans
struggling for their independence, a war which began in 1868. During that time hundreds of
thousands of white, black and mulatto countrymen died for the cause of independence. The
slaves and their descendants played a decisive role.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then came the century which is now coming
to an end. A Revolution took place in Cuba, which brought to the country its final
independence while the people of Jamaica continued struggling because they were still a
colony although slavery no longer existed. When in the second half of the previous century
we were struggling there against colonialism and slavery, here in Jamaica, where slavery
no longer existed, there were great anti-colonial revolutionary movements. I am thinking
of the rebellions at Morante Bay, so brutally repressed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The struggle did not cease, however, for
more than half of the present century. Neither emancipation nor independence came as a
gift to the Jamaican people. In the thirties, when the great crisis in Cuba gave way to
the revolutionary struggle of the unions, the workers and all the people demanding their
social, political and economic rights, a similar movement took place in Jamaica, under
complete colonial domination. After all, we were a semi-colony of the United States and
Jamaica was still a British Colony. That situation could not continue, the people of
Jamaica were finally able to gain their independence. Then, in the forties, the first
Constitution was established, still under a colonial regime. It was not until 1962, that
Jamaica could declare its definitive independence.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You can see the historical similarities of
Jamaica and Cuba. We are not only linked by geography, but also by history (<i>Applause</i>).
That is why yesterday and today we remember the heroes. Patterson mentioned their names:
Sharpe, Garvey (<i>Applause</i>), Bogle, Gordon and others, among them an extraordinary
woman combatant. This is the history we should teach our peoples, the people of Jamaica,
the peoples of the Caribbean, the people of Cuba and the peoples of The Americas (<i>Applause</i>)
because, as Patterson said, these are our roots.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Also slavery came at a high price in
history; slavery brought about in Cuba a movement for annexation to the United States
because the slave holders were for the most part Creoles -we use the word Creole to mean
Cuban descendants of Spaniards. Fearful of slave revolts or the abolition of slavery, they
wanted to join the slave owners in the United States, who were very interested in this
proposal, both for the sake of expansionism and because it would give them two more
senators in Congress to support their positions against the abolitionist movement.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So when Patterson just spoke of our people
noble efforts toward the liberation of Africa, I remembered that our struggle in that
field began very early. First it was political, along with Nkrumah, Sekou Touré, Nasser
and other leaders. Later, as the last colonies were struggling for their independence, it
changed into support for the armed movements in those countries which were still
colonized, such as Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe, Angola and
Mozambique, although in the latter, farther from Cuba, our support was primarily
political. After the assassination of Lumumba, we also supported the armed struggle of the
people in Congo against white mercenaries and traitors in the service of colonialism,
actions that saw the participation of a small contingent of Cuban instructors and
combatants led by our beloved comrade Ernesto Che Guevara (<i>Applause</i>). What did we
do but pay our debt to humanity, our debt to Africa and our debt to those who struggled
for our dignity, those who struggled for our independence in so many battlefields? This is
what we have done. We deserve no special recognition, no special thanks; we were merely
fulfilling our duty.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In our struggle against apartheid, or
against the soldiers of apartheid who occupied Namibia and constantly attacked Angola, our
country ran great risks. However, our support to Angola we did offer on our own, it was a
completely spontaneous action by Cuba (<i>Applause</i>); first the instructors, and then,
at a given moment, when we had a few hundred instructors there training the young
recruits, and the South Africans were rapidly advancing with elite armored troops toward
Luanda while the army of Mobutu-a man notoriously famous for his service to
imperialism-approached from the north to shatter the independence of Angola, we felt
obligated to send complete units, thousands of men, tens of thousands of men.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In 1975 and 1976, 35,000 Cuban combatants
were concentrated in Angola (<i>Applause</i>). There was no alternative. Once a struggle
begins there is no choice other than victory or death (<i>Applause</i>); hesitation
invites defeat. Therefore, without consulting anyone, we sent troops, complete units, as I
explained.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The first troops arrived in our planes, old
Britannia turboprops with more than 20 years of service and few spare parts, and they
stopped the South Africans (<i>Applause</i>). They were stopped, but then they had to be
chased out of Angola, since they had penetrated nearly a thousand kilometers into Angolan
territory.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Angolans had no army yet; recently
independent, they were still organizing, still training, still preparing for war.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Therefore it was necessary to make a great
effort; it was necessary to gain time. Enough troops were gathered to repel the South
Africans, forcing them to retreat to the Namibian border. This was in 1976. Yet, when the
Cuban troops began progressively withdrawing once the war was over, South African attacks
were resumed along the border, including massacres and air raids against Namibian refugee
communities. Hundreds of women and children were killed in some of the attacks. One of the
massacres that should never be forgotten was at Cassinga, where more than 500 people were
slaughtered, mainly children, women and the elderly. The children who survived were later
educated in our country (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Not only did South African troops intervene
in Angola, but other forces as well. A dirty war was unleashed and bands were created
throughout the country to destabilize the government. I can assure you that those bands
murdered hundreds of thousands of civilians, mind you, hundreds of thousands. They would
arrive in a village and kill the entire population, men, women and children.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In a territory of more than a million
square kilometers those weapons supplied by-and I am going to call a spade a spade-South
Africa, Mobutu's Congo and our neighbors to the north were used. Even though I would not
like to offend any State with which Jamaica maintains economic and diplomatic relations, I
must mention the United States of America (<i>Boos</i>). Hundreds of thousands of mines
were planted there by the enemies of the Angolan liberation, and hundreds of millions of
dollars were spent on weapons and supplies for the counterrevolutionary bands.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is the heroic struggle the Angolan
people had to wage for 15 years. However, those young combatants who at first were not
acquainted with the handling of weapons and the art of war became the excellent unbeatable
soldiers that we know so well because we fought shoulder to shoulder with them against the
army of apartheid (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But South Africa continued to intervene and
we had a theory, different from that of certain advisors-I won't mention them but you can
guess-who were in the headquarters advising offensives against distant targets in the
southeast of Angola, against the bandits&#146; alleged leadership and their general
headquarters, far from all sources of supplies, in sandy soil, such that when the Angolan
soldiers advanced a long distance in that direction, using up their fuel and supplies,
they ended up exhausting their forces and equipment. Then, the South Africans would close
in with their tanks, their planes and their long-range artillery defeating Angolan units
in absurdly poorly advised and ill-conceived military operations that we categorically
opposed and did not participate in.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But even though I am telling the story very
briefly, I should not omit one detail necessary for a better understanding (<i>Laughter</i>).
The advisors, in case you did not guess, were Soviets who thought they were waging the
Battle of Berlin, with Marshal Zhukok in command, thousands of tanks and 40,000 cannons.
An academic mentality trained in the purest form of conventional warfare. They did not
understand, nor could they understand the problems of the Third World, the setting of the
struggle and the type of war that must be waged in that setting. When in 1976 the war was
won, and the South African army was driven away from Angola, since victory has many
fathers, then our Soviet friends became interested and decided to generously support the
Angolans and supply them with weapons for the armed forces they were building.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, we could use our army&#146; s
weapons, but we had no way of supplying those needed by the Angolan army, and they needed
many. We agreed that they would advise the Angolan General Staff. We trained combatants in
schools, trained officers and defended with our troops-by then reduced to less than 20,000
men-the vast southern border from any attacks by South Africa. But whoever advises the
General Staff and provides the weapons wields a lot of influence.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today, at this meeting, I must say that we
used to tell the Soviets: &quot;If you want to advise the Angolans to carry out those
offensives, you must forbid South Africa's interference.&quot; This we said over and over
for three, four or five years, until there was a serious military crisis.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At that moment the South African army did
not limit itself to attacking to destroy the offensive troops under Soviet advisory but
decided to penetrate deeply into the territory and destroy the Republic of Angola. It was
counting on the support of the bandits organized within the country for more than 12 years
and this created a very complex situation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It was at that moment that we had to make
the most difficult decision, practically risking the life of the Revolution. We estimated
what was necessary to stop South Africa&#146;s interference and to finally defeat it. The
decision was made to send from Cuba all troops and the equipment required. It was then
that the famous battle of Cuito Cuanavale took place.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In that distant place, far from the supply
bases and the positions defended by our forces deployed far in the West, Cuban
reinforcements sent by air and land entered into action. They joined the Angolan troops
who, in a very difficult and unequal battle but offering desperate resistance, were
re-deploying towards the area where South Africa was trying to take control of an old
strategic air base built by the Portuguese. We had to gain time to allow for the arrival
of the equipment and weapons from Cuba in order to organize the main blow from the
Southwest of Angola, in the direction of Namibia.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We had analyzed how many cannons were
needed, how many tanks, soldiers, weapons, especially anti-aircraft weapons, including
complete groups of ground-to-air rockets and fighter planes. Actually, many of the best
weapons we had to defend Cuba from any attack were sent to Angola. They were sent in our
ships, we used our merchant marine that was applied in those days to transporting weapons
and troops. The total number of Cuban troops in Angola reached the figure of 55,000 in
those critical months. Cuba was to be defended by our people and the rest of the weapons
and units available. It still had millions of men and women ready to fight. But the
internationalist troops in Angola would not be exposed to defeat nor would we let South
Africa occupy the country. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We were monitored by our neighbors from
satellites so we had to move the units by night, take them to the ports and ship them to
Angola, a country farther from us than Moscow: 14 hours by plane to Luanda and at least 15
hours by plane from Havana to the south of Angola. But all the men were gathered, the
Cuito Cuanavale trap had been set, and the racist troops were smashed against the Angolan
and Cuban defense. While with our jabs-to use a boxing term-we kept them at a distance (<i>Laughter</i>),
with our right uppercut we threatened to annihilate them.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How many men participated in the counter
offensive on the border with Namibia, where the main South African barracks were located?
Approximately 30,000 Angolan troops and 40,000 Cubans, 1,000 anti-aircraft weapons-we had
to guarantee control of the air-hundreds of pieces of artillery, hundreds of armored
vehicles and trucks, 600 tanks and all the combat planes available. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">To this were added thousands of courageous
and tireless combatants from Namibia.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The troops advanced. Our friends from the
Soviet Union and other socialist countries refused to supply the ancillary fuel tanks for
the Mig-23. In just weeks a new military airport had to be built near the Namibian border
to expand the range of our planes and attain air supremacy, thanks to the expertise of our
pilots who could fly at very low altitude. Under these conditions we took control of the
water, with the dams that were on the border between Angola and Namibia and that supplied
the enemy troops. A few short battles and a limited air strike were sufficient. The army
of the apartheid regime did not take up the challenge. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We were happy with that, for a large battle
could have cost thousands of casualties. But the accumulation of forces was so great; the
defeat suffered in Cuito Cuanavale where the South African troops were smashed and
demoralized before this unconquerable bastion was so huge; Angolans, Namibians and Cubans
inspired so much respect with their heroic and resolute actions that peace negotiations
were finally initiated. (<i>Applause</i>) Based on them, United Nations Resolution 435 was
implemented acknowledging the independence of Namibia thus dealing the army of apartheid a
stunning political, military and moral blow. This is the history I can relate to you. (<i>Applause.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, there is a detail, a very important
thing that has yet to be investigated, and I say this today in Jamaica: South Africa had
seven atomic bombs at that time.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We suspected as much. We were not sure but
we took due precautions. Our troops advanced at night, with a large amount of
anti-aircraft weapons, opening underground shelters in the sands of Southwest Angola and
were solidly entrenched. They would advance in tactical groups of no more than 1,000 men,
heavily equipped with different types of weapons, in different directions, at a convenient
distance, always on the lookout for the enemy&#146;s use of the nuclear weapon. Not long
ago, after the demise of apartheid, the South African military admitted that at that
moment they had seven nuclear bombs that we assume had about the same destructive capacity
as those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What does this mean? That in spite of their
nuclear weapons, apartheid was defeated. This actually resulted from the combination of
the struggle by the heroic people of South Africa, the spirit implanted by Mandela, the
support of world public opinion and, in no small measure, the noble and altruistic actions
of Angolans and Cubans. Those actions that today the Western world, so often complacent
about apartheid, would not even like to remember.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We had reached a conclusion: since there
were no large concentrations of troops and based on the measures taken and the high morale
of these men, if they used nuclear weapons against Angolan and Cuban troops, even if their
planes were able to make it through and hit with certain precision some targets, the
damage would have been considerably reduced. And what was apartheid to do afterwards with
their nuclear weapons? Would they be used against the African people in South Africa? Not
even with those weapons could apartheid be sustained!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Scientists have confessed to other horrible
violations before the commission investigating the truth about crimes committed in South
Africa. Something we would have never imagined: the apartheid scientists were developing
biological weapons, diseases that would affect the black population but would be harmless
for the white population of South Africa. We really would never have been able to imagine
anything like this and we would never have known if the scientists had not confessed that
they were conducting this research to annihilate the black population.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Apartheid was much worse, much crueler,
much more reactionary, much more racist and much more fascist than what has been said.
That is the truth.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Everything happened as I have said. I must
add, Jamaican brothers, that for 15 years more than 500,000 Cuban combatants fulfilled
internationalist missions, mostly in Africa, given that the troops rotated. This is proof
of the spirit of solidarity of our people. We stood to gain in conscience, in spirit as we
had not gone there for economic gains.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Amilcar Cabral, who as many of you might
remember was the leader of PAIG -the Independence Party of Cape Verde and Guinea Bissau-
assassinated by mercenaries, he said something that greatly honors our people: When the
Cubans return home they will only take with them the remains of their comrades killed in
combat.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We do not have a single investment, a
single factory there; we did not go after mean economic interests. That is what happened (<i>Applause</i>)
and if we have felt in the need to talk about it it&#146;s because this subject was
touched upon here with extraordinarily generous words for Cuba. I must confess that I was
moved as I listened to this tribute to our dead.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Comrade Patterson, we have fulfilled our
duty and we are the ones who must thank our African ancestors, those who struggled here in
Jamaica as well as in Cuba where there were also significant slaves&#146; revolts at the
beginning of the past century.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are the ones who must thank the world,
and Africa, for what they have done for us.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is good to know, and to be able to
declare it today, that the best friends of Cuba are the Caribbeans and the Africans (<i>Applause</i>).
They are Cuba's best friends! Many are the demonstrations of friendship and solidarity
they have shown us!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I must recall-I cannot but do this- that
when all Latin America, except Mexico, severed relations with Cuba and became accomplices
to all the aggressions against our country and to the economic blockade-all this happened
before the independence of Jamaica and before the independence of the other CARICOM
nations-our country was totally isolated in this hemisphere. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I repeat, with the exception of Mexico and
the also honorable exception of Canada, every other government had severed relations with
Cuba, supporting the isolation, the blockade and the economic aggressions against Cuba.
They were accomplices of those who tried to, literally, destroy us. It was in the
Caribbean region where the initiative to struggle against this isolation and blockade was
born.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago and
Guyana were the first in this offensive (<i>Applause</i>), to which we must add the Panama
of Omar Torrijos who was then struggling for the return of the Canal. That movement led
the way, long before the defeat of apartheid. That is, the Caribbean solidarity with Cuba
is not related to the history I have just recounted to you, all that would come later.
Much earlier, Jamaica and other Caribbean countries had undertaken to put an end to Cuba's
isolation and today the great majority of Latin American countries have consular or
diplomatic relations with Cuba.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is another reason, Comrade Patterson,
why we should thank Jamaica and the CARICOM nations.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But, there is still more. Why do we belong
today to the Association of Caribbean States? Thanks to Jamaica (<i>Applause</i>), to
Michael Manley (<i>Applause</i>) whose memory we shall always cherish with gratitude
because they struggled hard to defeat Cuba's isolation and they made it possible for us to
become members of the Association of Caribbean States, made up of 34 states.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Something else: it was precisely thanks to
Jamaica and the Caribbean countries that Cuba was able to take part in the meeting of
Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group, with 71 member
states, parties to the Lomé Convention.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The 71 ACP countries signatories to the
Lomé Convention supported the presence of our Minister of Foreign Affairs at a meeting
held recently in Barbados where we were accepted as observers and where this was debated
with the Europeans. Also, a number of European nations, among them Spain, France and
Italy, together with the Caribbean countries, persuaded the rest of the European Union to
accept Cuba as an observer in the proceedings for a new Lomé Convention.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">And these are not the only reasons: There,
in that famous [Hemispheric] Summit, who were the ones that spoke most emphatically and
resolutely against the isolation of Cuba, against Cuba's absence from the Summit held in
Santiago de Chile? The Caribbean countries. They raised their voices without hesitation
and in the purest of English.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Who were the ones who, in a meeting with
the President of the United States-I think it was in Saint Lucia-strongly protested
against the cruel blockade of our country that seeks to kill our people through hunger and
diseases and tries to prevent our development? The Caribbean countries were the ones who
in English, in perfect English worthy of the Jamaican girl who was among the first in the
international English language contest, spoke to Clinton. And who spoke to him in Africa?
Many Africans did. But, who was it that face to face with him pointed an accusing finger,
full of prestige and fairness, to the President of the United States of America while
criticizing the policy of blockade against Cuba? It was Nelson Mandela.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is why we feel this sisterhood with
the Caribbean and African nations, that is why we feel so grateful. But we also feel this
brotherhood with the rest of the countries of the world, especially with the people of the
Third World. And still much earlier we had politically backed for many years and supported
with supplies from our sugar production and the training of technicians and doctors, the
heroic people of Vietnam in their exemplary struggle against the unjustifiable aggression
of the United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have in much the same way backed other
peoples in the world, and even though we may have bitter complaints about the behavior of
many Latin American governments-not the peoples that have always showed solidarity towards
Cuba-we also defend their cause as exploited countries, as countries that were kept in
poverty and underdevelopment, that were plundered. We forget our grievances, and in the
United Nations and the international fora, we also defend the interests of Latin America
in the same way that we firmly uphold the right of Caribbean countries to participation
because, all throughout history in this century, there have been attempts to ignore these
countries and the Caribbean countries cannot and will not be ignored in this hemisphere,
or in Europe, or anywhere in the world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Jamaica and the Caribbean can rely on Cuba
in every battle waged for their legitimate rights to prosperity and development. We are
among the first to oppose any measure within the World Trade Organization aimed at
suppressing the preferential rights and privileges that certain small countries, such as
the Caribbean, have acquired to allow them to progress amidst their geographic dispersion
and difficulties.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I shall not talk about these problems
today. I have taken too much of your time. But I do say here, Comrade Patterson, and I say
this today to my Jamaican comrades, brothers and sisters, that wherever this country or
any Caribbean country defends a just cause, Cuba will stand by them! (<i>Applause.</i>) We
shall never agree to deprive the Caribbean countries of the preferences they enjoy in the
Lomé Convention, the right to receive these preferences and favorable conditions, in
compliance with their natural difficulties, levels of development and their aspirations
for a better future.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is not a contradiction between Cuba and
the Latin American countries. It's just that it seems unfair to us to try to snatch away
modest quotas and markets that hardly amount to one percent of the world market from small
islands growing only a few hundred and, in some cases, a few thousand hectares of banana
devastated every time they are hit by a hurricane, and hurricanes are frequent in our
region. All this for the benefit of two or three big and rich American transnationals that
monopolize the banana market.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If we want a fair world, if we want a just
international economic order, those preferences must be maintained. Countries with
different levels of development can't be given the same treatment. Such concept is
unacceptable. It's not fair. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It's not humane. There are dozens and
dozens of countries struggling to develop in very difficult conditions and they should be
given preferential treatment. There shouldn't be and we shouldn't allow tabula rasa.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When all is said and done, if we look at
the statistical data and analyze it in depth, we can see a lot of things related to
specific international agreements.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">For example, for the Caribbean countries,
the international agreements of NAFTA have already meant the loss of more than 100,000
jobs and over 150 factories of manufactured goods. This is a reality. Now they want to
remove the preferences I mentioned. They also want to unilaterally change the telephone
charges. Whatever crosses their minds, they try to apply to the detriment of our peoples.
That is why we are in favor of the Caribbean, Central America and Latin America-including
Mercosur and the Andean Pact-grouping together, uniting to defend their interests in every
the international forum. (<i>Applause.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">No more forgetting the Caribbean!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There will soon be an important meeting of
the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, which will be chaired by that outstanding
personality of our history, Nelson Mandela. And there, the Third World countries parties
to that Movement, that amount to more than 100, will have to discuss these issues in order
not to be deceived, so as to really know what will the use be of the WTO, if it is only to
defend the patents of the United States and of the richest countries which have stolen the
world's best minds; to remove all the customs barriers and abolish the preferences of
countries suffering from different conditions of a natural or historical nature and from
different levels of development. All these questions must be clearly answered for the
benefit of our peoples, of this generation, but above all, for the benefit of future
generations.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Those of us who were slaves, those of us
who were colonized have to continue fighting and fighting together for development, for
peace. We don't want a war against anybody, but rather war against inequality, war against
injustice, peace among all nations and all the peoples of the world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In this struggle proposed by comrade
Patterson, we will be in the front line, because we are well aware of the sufferings human
beings have had to endure throughout history, of the abuse, and the injustice.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are against the injustice of the past,
of the era of Greece, Rome and the Pharaohs. We are against the injustice of the Middle
Ages and we are against the injustice and the abuses committed during the conquest of this
continent, practically exterminating the indigenous population and enslaving millions and
millions of Africans. We are against the injustice of the past but we must also be, and we
are, against the injustice of the present and there is much of it. And we must never
accept the injustice of the future.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Because we believe in mankind, we are
certain to achieve our goals. As we know the truth, we will know how to defend it and we
will also ask, for example: What has happened with the Caribbean Basin Initiative? What's
left of it? What are we going to export? Products that need a lot of cheap labor and a lot
of sweat while paying low wages? What are we going to keep importing? Commodities that
require a high investment rate of capital, technology and know-how? Why? Why is it that,
while the exports from the Caribbean come to approximately 2.5 billion dollars-I'm talking
about the exports from CARICOM-the imports reach a volume of almost twice as much? To be
more exact, what the </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">United States imports from CARICOM comes to
approximately 2.5 billion while its exports to those countries amount to almost four
billion. There is a deficit that grows in their favor every year. Why are our products
cheaper and cheaper and the goods that we import more and more expensive? Why the
preeminence of such unequal terms of trade? We have to fight against that-and we will
fight with growing force.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Yesterday, in Montego Bay, we said this:
&quot;Yesterday's slaves will be the models for the peoples of tomorrow.&quot; And you are
proving that by building a country like this, which is facing difficulties, just like
other countries, as our own country. But we marvel at the organization, the education, the
culture, the dignity of this country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have been able to observe the same thing
in other Caribbean countries. In the future, let them come here to Jamaica and other
Caribbean countries, not just to lie down under the sun, or swim in the beaches but to get
to know peoples with a great sense of honor and dignity, with extraordinary talents in
every field and with a goodness that emanates from every pore of their bodies. Let them
come to our countries so that they can get an idea of what a more fraternal and dignified
world could be. Whatever problems there still are, whatever inequalities there might still
be, what is clear to us are the efforts of the leaders in these countries to provide
enough schools for all children, to have hospitals, to create jobs, to have social justice
prevail, to have a fairer distribution of wealth.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I'll give you an example: Latin America has
been independent for 200 years. However, the CARICOM countries, which have had barely 30
or 35 years of independence, have better education and health rates than the rest of the
Latin American countries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In one year, Cuba eradicated illiteracy. (<i>Applause</i>)
It then continued with its program to upgrade education. Presently, we have no
illiterates. (<i>Applause.</i>) Now, our people&#146;s level of schooling is higher than
the 10th grade. Now, Cuba has 600,000 university-graduate professionals. In our country
today, despite poverty, the blockade and the special period, there are schools for all
children and hospitals and doctors to care for every patient. (<i>Applause.</i>) That is
the country some try to isolate! Those are the people enduring a blockade!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">No, they never blockaded those who caused
the disappearance of more than 100,000 citizens in one Central American country and tens
of thousands in other countries. No, they did not blockade apartheid. The apartheid regime
could trade and purchase weapons and technology. And that racist minority enjoyed every
privilege while tens of millions of Africans were going hungry. They blockade Cuba because
it wanted to be free, completely free, because it wanted social justice.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thank you once again, brother Patterson,
for the various occasions in which you have denounced the blockade, for the various times
our Caribbean brothers have denounced the blockade! Nothing can divide us!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Let nobody be mislead into believing that
the development of tourism in Cuba-as some press circles interested in dividing us have
been saying-could harm tourism in the Caribbean, in Jamaica. That is as ridiculous as
saying that the development of tourism in Spain harmed tourism in France or in Italy. A
few decades ago, Spain received three or four million tourists. Now, Spain receives 50
million, France over 60 million and Italy tens of millions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is as ridiculous as saying that the
development of tourism in Jamaica harmed the development of tourism in the rest of the
Caribbean countries. Jamaica was the first and, thanks to its efforts, a whole tourist
zone has been created in the Caribbean. The development of tourism in Jamaica did not harm
the development of tourism in the Dominican Republic.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What we have proposed is the creation in
the Caribbean of the best tourist zone in the world and the most beautiful, the one with
the best services, with the greatest cultural wealth, with the best attractions. In this
endeavor we are not, and we will never be, competitors. As Patterson says, we will be
partners, we will be brothers. Our beaches are there, if the Jamaicans want to invest in
those beaches, as some already have, we shall welcome them with open arms. And if one day
we can invest in Jamaica, we will also invest in Jamaica or in any other island.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Partners and brothers, not competitors. We
have the conditions so that millions and millions, tens and tens of millions of tourists
can visit the Caribbean Basin.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The development of Cancun-a large tourist
city, also in the Caribbean&#151;did not prevent the development of tourism in Jamaica or
the Dominican Republic. The magnificent hotels that we have seen here did not prevent the
development of Cuba. On the contrary, more and more people want to go there and we should
work together so that the whole world travels to the Caribbean, not just Canadians and
Europeans but also Japanese, Chinese and even Russians, because there are now some who
have high incomes there after the State was confiscated by those who were running it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Tourism really does have a great future and
it is up to us to take over as much of that market as possible. Cuba will be making that
effort too, shoulder to shoulder, alongside the Jamaicans and the Caribbeans.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Another point relating to the Lomé
Convention. I want to solemnly declare here, opposite those schemers who assert that
Cuba's entry into that convention is going to harm other Caribbean countries, that, above
all else, we will always give priority to the interests of these countries. Let me begin
by telling you that, for example, we do not export bananas.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have an 11 million population and the
banana we grow, all very technical, goes to our domestic market which is considerable;
that if we are not hit by a hurricane that turns down all the banana plantations and
leaves us without bananas in some regions for up to two years. And those are bananas grown
either under the micro-jet or the dripping irrigation systems, with a good production
rate. But still, the eastern winds brought by the hurricanes cause them a lot of damage.
And, now, with the climate changes, more and more often winter winds from the west, over a
100 kilometers an hour, are hitting our banana plantations.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But the important thing is: we will never
do anything detrimental to the preferences or privileges of the countries that are now
parties to the Lomé Convention.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Caribbeans invited us because they have
confidence in Cuba, in Cuba's word, in Cuba's unselfishness and in the honesty of our
country. They also did because we see this struggle of yours, of Central America, of South
America, of Africa, of the Third World, in the Summits, in Lomé and everywhere, as source
of inspiration for our feelings about unity, justice and solidarity.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In conclusion, we very much regret that the
Caribbean has no representative among the non-permanent members of the Security Council,
an important body of the United Nations. We understand that Jamaica aspires-in all
fairness and with all due recognition won in its efforts for unity and integration-to be a
non-permanent member of the Security Council.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Let me take this opportunity to say to you
that Jamaica can rely on Cuba's total and unqualified support in that endeavor and in
whatever else it might need.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I also wonder why there is no Caribbean
nation in the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. Why is no Caribbean country a member of
it? If any Caribbean country should aspire to be a permanent member of the Human Rights
Commission in Geneva, it can count on Cuba's total and unconditional support.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have powerful adversaries, but we have
brave friends and we see them there at the United Nations when they vote en masse against
the blockade or in Geneva when they vote against the maneuvers so unfairly undertaken
against Cuba. Modest countries, poor countries that show political gallantry-like Jamaica
before and its Prime Minister today-always excite the world's admiration. I can assure you
that not everybody on this planet dares to speak with such independence, with such bravery
and with such a noble and constructive spirit as he did yesterday and today.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our eternal gratitude for your support; our
deepest thanks for the lessons we have learned here in Jamaica.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If you could forgive me for taking up so
much of your time, even without saying a lot of things that I would like to have said,
then I will walk away from this rally the happiest man on Earth.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Long live Jamaica! (<i>Exclamations.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Long live the Caribbean! (<i>Exclamations.</i>)</font></p>
