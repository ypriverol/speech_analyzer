<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>SPEECH BY COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
FIDEL CASTRO AT THE SPECIAL MEETING OF HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT OF CARIFORUM. Santo
Domingo, Dominican Republic. August 21, 1998</strong></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Honorable Leonel Fernández, President of
the Dominican Republic,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Excellencies,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Globalization is inevitable. It would be
useless to oppose a law of history, but this one presently unfolding can, from an equally
historical perspective, be transformed; and it should definitely be transformed, otherwise
our species would not be able to survive. Perhaps, it is already late but it would be
better not to wait until it is too late.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A small group of wealthy nations enjoys and
advertises irrational and unsustainable consumer patterns while the overwhelming majority
of the population, growing exponen-tially in the Third World, is enduring an increasingly
humiliating and appalling poverty.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is the intention to accord equal
treatment to countries which differ greatly in their capabilities and development stages;
that is terribly unfair. Our particularly backward and vulnerable economies - a logical
consequence of centuries of colonialism, slavery and pillage - would never be able to
successfully take part in the world economy in the absence of preferential schemes and of
a great contribution in non-repayable foreign resources.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">For 50 years, we have been deceived with
the promise of reducing the extensive gap between the poor and the rich countries that has
continued to widen every minute of this half century since the war.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The so-called reciprocity would be an
outrageously arbitrary historical injustice. The developed countries which are demanding
the implementation of that mean principle and the indiscriminate opening of our markets do
not hesitate to use countless pretexts to keep in place and strengthen different kinds of
protectionism, including tariff and non-tariff mechanisms.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Based on provisions by the World Trade
Organization attempts are being made to do away with any instrument that protects the
value of exports and may contribute to the comprehensive development of the Caribbean
nations and the rest of the Third World countries. They don&#146;t mind if in the process
we are stripped of our sovereignty and threatened with the devastation of our
peoples&#146; identity and their rich, diverse and in some instances millennial cultural
traditions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The official development assistance, which
to a certain extent could mitigate the harmful effects of the world economy present
trends, is constantly diminishing. The external debt continues to grow as an excruciating
burden on the countries striving for development. The increasing deterioration of the
terms of reference, a subtle but ruthless form of plundering, is another obstacle for many
of our countries on the way to progress.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Amidst these trends, the Caribbean region
is facing the serious danger of a growing neglect. Some prevailing circumstances and
perceptions are assigning our countries less important roles in the new global order that
is shaping. It would seem that the very survival of our peoples lacks in significance. The
banana issue is a case in point since the actions against the European import system moved
by the selfish interests of two big American trans-national corporations might brutally
sacrifice the economy of small Caribbean exporting nations whose output is hardly one
percent of that product in the world trade.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">An attempt is made at imposing an economic
order in which our small and poor countries would have no choice but to become an immense
free zone where the capital and industries of the powerful would find cheap labor force,
destroy our environment, deplete our resources and multiply their profits without even
paying taxes, when these countries no longer receive the modest custom benefits they used
to obtain. How would they pay for education, medical services, social security, housing,
drinking water and many other basic needs of the population?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We cannot accept the idea that the poor
countries&#146; only choice is to continue competing among themselves in a wild race to
make more and more concessions for attracting the capital and technology indispensable for
their development.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Multilateral Agreement on Investments
presently under discussion at the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development -
and exclusive club for the rich - intends to move capital all around the planet leaving
the states helpless and turning the countries into half-way stations where they can obtain
the most profits and destroy the environment.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our countries recognize the role of the
international capital in today&#146;s world economy but we cannot accept the dismantling
of our sovereignty nor can we relinquish the possibility of having national development
programs. Cuba finds it intolerable that the Multilateral Agreement on Investments would
try something as absurd as the idea of turning the extraterritorial principles of the
Helms-Burton Act - which the U.S. government wants to impose and the Caribbean nations so
honorably reject - into a binding international legal code.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Likewise, our future is threatened by the
artificial economy of wild financial speculation that neoliberal globalization has
encouraged to such an extent as to make it insufferable for that very system speculating
in stocks, bonds, national currencies or anything that can generate profits. Massive
amounts of money are used to generate more money and multiply it without a production
backup, without building new factories, with absolute disregard for real trade in goods or
services. Such an artificial economy has turned the world into a large casino where
everyday bets reach 1.5 trillion dollars, equivalent to the total value of the world
economy gross product in over 15 days.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That&#146;s why economic crises are
unleashed, financial bubbles explode, massive migrations cannot be stopped, the climate
changes, more people are victims of preventable diseases and social and political
instability is not the exception but the rule.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Amidst so many difficulties, we admire the
tenacious efforts by the CARICOM countries in favor of their peoples&#146; well-being and
the development of their economies. Through multidestination, tourism might well become
the driving force behind Caribbean integration, trading growth, investments and contacts
among our countries. We might project our image to the world as the most appealing tourist
destination, a unique and diverse destination, which would offer a good example on the
preservation of the environment and our natural resources.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As for tourist development in our region
Cuba is not, and will not be, a competitor but a close partner and collaborator. Our
beaches and tourist facilities are open to Caribbean investors from countries in the
region interested in taking part in Cuban tourism as we are willing to have Cuban
investments in the Caribbean sister nations we feel so close to.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are deeply appreciative of the Caribbean
states for their support which has made possible our participation, as observers, in the
forthcoming negotiations for a new agreement on the Lome Convention. We will always give a
priority to the interests of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of countries
signatories to that Convention. We will not do anything that may in a any way impair or
reduce the preferences of the member countries; we shall work together with them, with our
distinct devotion and loyalty, in order to preserve and expand those fair preferences.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Unity is the only real force available to
the Caribbean region. Only if united we will be able to defend ourselves as a region and
expand that unity to Central America, South America, Africa and the peoples of other
continents.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Caribbean unity is also a blunt refusal to
any attempt at division.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The problems of the Caribbean region cannot
be separated from the problems of the Third World, much less from Humanity; and they all
require global responses.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Third World nations are our allies,
particularly the Non-Aligned Movement member countries. Those who were yesterday
discovered, fragmented, conquered and turned into colonies have today the possibility to
act as a majority force in the different fora where the 21st century world is being
decided.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Caribbean region should be represented
at the UN Security Council as the region deserves for its prestige, its history and its
political capability, as it should also be present at the Human Rights Commission and in
every forum where battles are being waged for the peoples right to life and well-being.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The future is in our hands. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What we are asking for, and should
definitely fight for, is for the inevitable globalization taking place today according to
the laws of history to be the globalization of fraternity and cooperation among all
peoples, of sustainable development and a fair distribution and rational use of the
abundant material and spiritual riches that man can create with his hands and mind, as an
indispensable premise for the inescapably common homeland of a humanity that can, and
should, endure.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thank you, very much. </font></p>
