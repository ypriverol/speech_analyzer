<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>SPEECH BY COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF FIDEL
CASTRO AT THE SPECIAL SESSION COMMEMORATING THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF THE MULTILATERAL TRADE
SYSTEM. Palais des Nations, Geneva, Switzerland. May 19, 1998</strong></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Excellencies,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">World Trade Organization officials,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Distinguished delegates,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Last March, the U.S. government made public
the &quot;1998 Trade Policy Agenda of the United States&quot; where it was literally
indicated that it is set to be &quot;aggressive, directed globally and at all key regions
of the world&quot;; that &quot;as the most important and successful economy in the global
trading system, the United States is in a strong position to use its powers of persuasion
and influence to pursue this Agenda&quot;; and that &quot;despite the substantial market
openings that have been achieved in recent years, there remain too many barriers to U.S.
goods and services exports throughout the world&quot;. Such language is distressing. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Together with this, on September 1995
following a United States initiative, even though the World Trade Organization already
existed with 132 member countries in different stages of development, discussions began in
the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) - an exclusive First World
club - to work out a Multilateral Agreement on Investments.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Due to problems obviously related to the
sovereignty of states, the subsequent idea to negotiate that agreement in the World Trade
Organization was strongly opposed by numerous members at the Ministerial Conference held
in Singapore on December 1996. However, the agreements reached there did not prevent the
OECD - made up as I said by developed countries - from proceeding with the elaboration of
the Multilateral Agreement on Investments.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Attempts by the United States to introduce
key aspects of the Helms-Burton Act in said Agreement led the negotiations to a
standstill, leaving only the United States and Europe involved while the other 13 OECD
member nations were left out.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The above mentioned Act illustrates the
United States behavior in its economic war against Cuba. The extraterritorial nature of
these and other measures led the European Union to request from the WTO the establishment
of a Special Panel which was then approved on November 20, 1996.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Later on, by 11 April, 1997 an
understanding was reached on the basis of certain American pledges associated with the
implementation of, and amendments to, the Helms-Burton Act. The European Union, to avoid
weakening the WTO, agreed to temporarily suspend the beginning of the Special Panel
activities.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">An amazing and shrewd maneuver had allowed
the United States to leave the dock at the WTO and undertake to laying down new rules in
international law within the framework of the OECD in an attempt to retroactively insert
in the Multilateral Agreement on Investments the supposed illegality of the
nationalizations conducted in the late 1950s - a date exactly coinciding with the triumph
of the Revolution in Cuba - a principle that can also be applied to nationalizations in
other countries after 1959, the intention being to inter-nationalize the principles of the
infamous Helms-Burton Act under the umbrella of a multilateral agreement. That Act, which
has not been amended at all, has arbitrarily turned people who were Cuban citizens at the
time of the expro-priations into expropriated Americans.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Actually, the extraterritorial principle of
the blockade had been in force long before that shameful Act came into existence. The U.S.
Administration prevents every American company, whatever the country where it is based,
from trading with Cuba. That constitutes a violation of sovereignty and is
extraterritorial by nature. There are plenty of reasons for the world to feel humiliated
and be concerned, and the WTO should be capable of preventing an economic genocide.
Disputes between the United States and the European Union about this law should not be
settled at the expense of Cuba. That would be an inconceivable dishonor for Europe. The
agreements announced in London yesterday are unclear, contradictory and threatening for
many countries, as they are unethical. The economic blockade has already cost Cuba 60
billion U.S. dollars.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In the last few years, the United States
has approved over 40 laws and executive decisions to apply unilateral economic sanctions
against 75 nations representing 42 percent of the world population.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The United States obtained practically
everything it wanted from the agreements leading to the establishment of the WTO, and
particularly the General Agreement on Services, its old dream. The same applies to the
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, a field where it holds
a privileged control thanks to its technological development and systematic plundering of
the best minds in the world. Some of its patents have received up to 50 years of exclusive
rights and it has additionally obtained other highly beneficial agreements. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The United States also has the peculiar
privilege of issuing the currency in which the central banks and the trade bank deposits
worldwide keep most of their hard currency reserves. The transnational companies of the
nation whose citizens have the lowest saving rates are purchasing the world riches with
the money saved by people in other countries and the money printed without the gold
backing agreed upon in Bretton Woods, and unilaterally ended in 1971.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Therefore, if the Eurocurrency emerges as a
strong and prestigious currency, the Euro be welcome! It would benefit the world economy!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">New issues introduced in the WTO's agenda
by the wealthy countries are threatening with a reduction of the developing countries'
competitive possibilities, and that in the midst of already difficult conditions fraught
with inequalities, which will certainly be used as pretexts for non-tariff barriers or to
prevent their commodities&#146; access to the markets.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Third World countries have been loosing
everything: custom tariffs that protected their emerging industries and produced revenues;
agreements on basic commodities; producers associations; price indexation; preferential
treatment; any instrument protecting their exports value and contributing to their
development. What are we being offered?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Why isn't the unfair and unbalanced trade
mentioned? Why is the appalling burden of the external debt no longer being discussed? Why
is the Official Development Aid being reduced? If every developed country did like Norway,
there would be 200 billion U.S. dollars available to the Third World for its development.
Norway should be imitated!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How are we supposed to make a living? What
goods and services shall we export? Which industrial productions will be left to us? Only
those with a technology gap and a high input of human labor, and the highly pollutants?
Might this be an attempt to turn a large part of the Third World into an immense free zone
full of assembly plants that do not even pay taxes?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Why is the strongest economic power in the
world obstructing China's access to the WTO when that country shelters one fifth of the
world population? Why does it jeopardize the admission of Russia and other countries? No
nation, big or small, can be left out of this important institution, nor should it; and
its admission must not be subjected to humiliating conditions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The developing countries must fend off
divisions. Unity is our only asset, the only guaranty in the defense of our legitimate
aspirations.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Those of us who were colonies yesterday and
are still today enduring the consequences of backwardness, poverty and underdevelopment,
we are the majority in this organization. Every one of us has the right to a vote and no
one has the right to veto. We should turn this Organization into an instrument of the
struggle for a more just and better world. We should also appeal to those responsible
statesmen, sensitive to our realities, who can undoubtedly be found in many developed
countries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite so much euphoria no one can be sure
of how long the United States economic system, ruled by the blind laws of the market
economy, will be able to prevent a financial meltdown. There are no economic miracles.
That is clear now. The absurdly inflated stock prices in the Stock Markets of that economy
- unquestionably the strongest in the world - cannot be sustained. In similar situations
history is not known to have made exceptions. The problem is that now a big crisis would
be global and have unforeseeable consequences. Not even the adversaries of the prevailing
system could wish that to happen.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It would be worthwhile for the WTO to
assess these risks and include among the so-called &quot;new issues&quot; another one:
&quot;Global Economic Crisis. What to do?&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thank you, very much.</font></p>
