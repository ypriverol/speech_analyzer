<p ALIGN="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>SPEECH DELIVERED BY
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF FIDEL CASTRO AT THE SOUTH AFRICAN PARLIAMENT. Capetown, South Africa.
September 4, 1998</strong></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Honorable Mrs. Frene Ginwala, President of
the National Assembly;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Honorable Mr. Lekota, President of the
National Council of Provinces;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Honorable Members of the South African
Parliament;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Distinguished Guests:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">While flying to South Africa, I was
informed that this address should be written, given the need for its translation and
distribution among the guests who would not have access to simultaneous translation. I
tried to imagine what my impression would be on arriving to this Parliament, and what
could I say that would be worthy of the interest and attention of those who so graciously
have come to listen to my words.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What I have prepared, with the aid of some
data, is therefore, only the fruit of my imagination, like a love letter to a sweetheart
written thousands of miles away, without knowing how she thinks or what she wants to hear
and without even knowing what her face looks like (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I consider that a speech is an intimate and
frank conversation. I have become accustomed to simply talk and dialogue with my
interlocutors while looking at their faces, trying to persuade them of what I say (<i>Laughs
and applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If at some point, I drift away from this
text to add things, as new ideas occur to me, I hope that those who do not have earphones
will forgive me, that the organizers and persons in charge of ensuring the efficiency and
solemnity of this act will understand (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As you can see, everything is different.
There aren't earphones for anyone, so there will be a direct translation (<i>Pointing to
the translator</i>). I will have to read paragraph by paragraph, idea by idea.
Interruptions will be minimal. This proves once again that one cannot despair in the face
of difficulties, that there is a solution for everything (<i>Laughs and applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As I think about this country and its
history, all sorts of events run through my mind, facts, data, realities which reflect the
enormous responsibility and colossal and historical task of creating the new South Africa
you propose for yourselves.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I hope that my presence here will leave, as
a sole and fundamental remembrance, the fervent and sincere wish to support your enormous
efforts aimed at healing the deep wounds that have for centuries been opened.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This promising country, which yesterday was
subjected to isolation and universal condemnation, tomorrow may be an example of
brotherhood and justice. The timely presence, at the precise moment, of a leader of
exceptional humane and political conditions make it possible. This man, kept in the somber
corners of a prison, was more than a political prisoner serving a life sentence; he was a
prophet of politics (<i>Applause</i>), who enjoys today the appreciation of even those who
once hated and punished him without mercy (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Nelson Mandela will not go down in history
for the 27 consecutive years he spent in prison, without ever forsaking his ideals (<i>Applause</i>);
he will be remembered because he was capable of stripping from his heart all the venom
that such unjust punishment can accumulate (<i>Exclamations of: &quot;Yes!&quot; and
applause</i>); for his generosity and the wisdom he showed in brilliantly leading his
self-sacrificing and heroic people when the hour of victory could no longer be contained,
deeply convinced that South Africa could not be built on hatred and revenge (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today there are still two South Africas,
which I should not refer to as white and black, those terms should be forever banished if
a multi-racial and united country is to be built (<i>Applause</i>). I rather put it
another way: two South Africas, one rich and one poor (<i>Applause</i>), one and the
other; one where an average family receives two times the income of the other; one in
which 13 out of every 1 000 children die before reaching their first year of life; another
in which the number of children who die is 57; one in which life expectancy is 73 years,
another where it is only 56 years; one in which 100% of the people can read and write;
another where the illiteracy rate is over 50%; one in which there is broad, almost full
employment; another in which 45% of the people are unemployed; one in which 12% of the
population owns almost 90% of the land; another where almost 80% of its inhabitants own
less than 10% (<i>Exclamations of: &quot;Yes!&quot; and applause</i>); one which
accumulated and possesses almost all of the technical and administrative know how; another
which was condemned to inexperience and ignorance; one that enjoys well being and freedom;
the other which has only conquered freedom without well being (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is not possible to change this terrible
heritage overnight (<i>Applause</i>). You gain nothing whatsoever by disorganizing the
productive apparatus or by not taking advantage of the considerable material and technical
wealth and the productive efficiency created by the noble hands of the workers under a
cruel and unjust, virtually a slavery system. The undertaking of social changes in an
ordered, gradual and peaceful manner so that this wealth may bring to the South African
people maximum benefits, is perhaps one of the most difficult tasks that human society can
ever achieve (<i>Applause</i>). It is, in the view of this daring visitor whom you have
invited here to say a few words, the greatest challenge that South Africa is facing today
(<i>Exclamations of &quot;Yes!&quot;</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I reject demagogy. I would never utter a
word to incite discontent, let alone to win applause or please the ears of millions of
South Africans who are rightly hurting because the paradise of equal opportunities and
justice for all, a dream of so many years of struggle, has not yet been attained in their
country (<i>Exclamations of &quot;Yes!&quot;</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are many nations with similar
economic and social problems resulting from the conquest, the colonization and the
unbearable disparities in the distribution of wealth; but no where else did the struggle
for the respect of&nbsp;human dignity awaken so much hope. The contradiction between
hopes, possibilities and priorities is not only a matter of South Africa&#146;s domestic
affairs; it is the object of debate, and it will for long continue to be debated, by
honest scholars in many countries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The system of conquest, colonization,
slavery, extermination of the indigenous populations and the plundering of their natural
resources during the last centuries, left terrible sequels in the overwhelming majority of
the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Seventy million natives were exterminated
in the American Hemisphere through ruthless exploitation, slave work, imported diseases or
by the sword of the conquistadors.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Twelve million Africans were torn from
their villages and homes and taken in chains to a new continent to work as slaves on the
plantations, without counting the millions who drowned or perished during the voyage.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Actually, apartheid was universal and
lasted centuries (<i>Applause</i>). In our hemisphere, the slaves were the first to
revolt, in one way or another, against colonial domination as early as the 16th century.
Large uprisings in Jamaica, Barbados occurred during the early 18th century, long before
the rebellion of the North American colonies at the end of that century. The first
republic in Latin America was established by the slaves in Haiti. In Cuba, years later,
heroic and massive slave revolts occurred. The slaves of African origin pointed out the
way to freedom in that continent.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Many of the crimes in history weigh heavily
on the conscious of the civilized and Christian West, as they like to qualify themselves (<i>Prolonged
applause</i>). Not only those who in South Africa conceived and applied the apartheid
system, have to shoulder all the burden of guilt.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The political miracle of unity,
reconciliation and peace, under the guidance of Nelson Mandela, may eventually become an
unprecedented example in History (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Recalling in part the meaning of a famous
phrase, one can say that never before did so many wish so much for such a few. You, South
African citizens and leaders of all parties, from all ethnic origin, are the few to whom
we wish so much and from which all the inhabitants of this planet expect so much from the
political and humane point of view.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">One idea can lead to another: from the new
South Africa, the hope for a new Africa (<i>Applause</i>). South Africa, from the
economic, industrial, agricultural, technological and scientific point of view, is the
most developed country on the African continent. Its mineral and energetic wealth is
countless and, in many cases, the first in the world. Today, South Africa generates 50% of
the electricity of the continent, 85% of the steel and 97% of the coal. It transports 69%
of all of the railway freight, owns 32% of all the motor vehicles and 45% of the paved
roads. The rest of Africa is also immensely rich in natural resources. Those who have had
the privilege of struggling side by side with them, either fighting for freedom or in
peaceful construction, are very much aware of the enormous potential and untapped talent
of its sons and daughters, their extraordinary valor and intelligence, their capacity to
assimilate the most complex scientific and technical know-how (<i>Prolonged applause</i>).
</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Cuba is a small island located next to a
very powerful neighbor. Notwithstanding, the educational centers in our country have
already graduated 26 294 African professionals and technicians (<i>Applause</i>), and
other 5 850 have been trained there. Furthermore, 80 524 Cuban civilian cooperators -
including 24 714 doctors, dentists, nurses and health-care technicians, as well as tens of
thousands professors, teachers, engineers, and other professionals and skilled workers -
have rendered internationalist services in Africa (<i>Applause</i>). For over thirty
years, 381 432 Cuban soldiers and officers have been on duty-service or have fought
hand-in-hand with African soldiers and officers in this continent for national
independence or against foreign aggression. (<i>Prolonged applause</i>). The total number
is 461 956 in a short historical period. From these African soils, where they worked and
fought voluntarily and selflessly, they have only taken back home to Cuba the remains of
their fallen comrades and the honor of a duty accomplished (<i>Applause</i>). That&#146;s
how we know so well and appreciate the human qualities of the sons of Africa; much better
than those who colonized and exploited this continent for centuries (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today, we witness with profound and
heart-trending pain its fratricidal wars, economic underdevelopment, poverty, famine, lack
of hospitals and schools, and poor communications. We are shocked to see that Manhattan or
Tokyo have more telephones than the entire Africa.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Its deserts are growing, its forests are
disappearing, and its soils are eroding. And something dreadful: old and new diseases,
such as malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, cholera, ebola, parasites, and curable
communicable ailments are decimating its people. Its infant mortality rate is hitting
record highs as compared to the rest of the world, as is also the case of the mothers who
die during labor. In some of its countries, life expectancy is beginning to decline.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The terrible HIV is spreading
geometrically. It is not an overstatement and you know it; entire African nations are
threatened to perish. Each infected person would need to spend $10 000 each year in drugs
only for survival, while health-care budgets can barely appropriate $10.00 per capita. At
current prices, it would be required to spend $250 billion in Africa every year only to
combat AIDS. Hence, Africa reports 9 in ten persons killed by AIDS in the planet.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Can the world be heedless of this disaster?
Isn&#146;t Man capable of addressing this situation with his astonishing scientific
advances? What&#146;s the point of talking about macro-economic indicators and other
eternal fallacies; recipes and more recipes from the International Monetary Fund and the
World Trade Organization, or the miraculous strengths of the blind market laws and the
wonders of neo-liberal globalization? (<i>Applause</i>) Why aren&#146;t these realities
recognized? Why aren&#146;t alternative formulas being pursued, and is recognized that Man
can organize his life and destiny in a more rational and humane fashion? (<i>Applause</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A deep and unavoidable economic crisis -
perhaps the worst ever - is threatening us all. In this world turned into a casino, $1.5
trillion-worth speculative transactions unrelated to the actual economy are made every day
(<i>Shouts of &quot;Yes!&quot; and applause</i>). Never before in the economic history of
the world had such a phenomenon occurred.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The stocks prices in the US stock markets
have multiplied to absurdity. Only a historic privilege associated with a number of
factors made it possible for a rich nation to become the world authority issuing the
reserve currency kept by the central banks of every country. Its Treasury bonds are the
ultimate shelter for any investors frightened by a financial crisis. The dollar lost its
backup in gold when that country unilaterally repealed the conversion established in
Bretton Woods. As was long dreamed by the alchemists of the Middle Ages, the notes were
converted to gold, and the value of the world&#146;s reserve currency has been, ever
since, a simple matter of trust. Wars, such as that of Vietnam, at a cost of $500 billion,
gave rise to this enormous deceit. This was compounded by a colossal military build-up
without taxes that raised the US public debt from $700 billion to $2.5 trillion in just
eight years.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Money has become a fiction, and securities
have no actual or material support any more. In recent years, American investors have
acquired $9 trillion through a simple mechanism of galloping multiplication of share
prices in their stock markets. As a result, their transnational corporations have made
huge investments both overseas and at home, while domestic consumption has risen
excessively, thus artificially nurturing an economy that has seemed to grow steadily, free
of inflation and crises. Sooner or later, the world would have to pay the price.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The most thriving nations in South East
Asia have been bankrupted. The world&#146;s second largest economy, Japan, can no longer
stem its downturn, the strength of its yen tumbling. The yuan has upheld its rate by dint
of a sacrifice being made by China, whose high growth rate will drop this year below 8%, a
number dangerously close to the limit of tolerance for a country engaged in a fast radical
reform and an extraordinary labor downsizing in its production enterprises. Re-enter the
Asian crisis, and an economic disaster hits Russia where the greatest economic and social
failure ever has been the result of an attempt to build capitalism there (<i>Applause</i>),
in spite of immense economic assistance, recommendations and prescriptions given by the
best Western minds (<i>Laughter</i>). And this is also the time of the greatest political
risk arising from the situation created in a State that holds thousands of nuclear
warheads and where the operators of strategic missiles have not seen their paychecks in
five months (<i>Laughter and applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Stock markets in Latin America have, over
the last few months, lost over 40% of their share value, and in Russia, 75%. This
phenomenon is becoming widespread. Commodities such as copper, nickel, aluminum, crude oil
and many others have seen their prices slashed by 50% in a large number of countries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The US stock markets are already shaking.
As you are aware, they have just experienced a black Monday. I don&#146;t know why they
call it black (<i>Applause</i>); in fact, it has been a white Monday (<i>Applause</i>).
When and how panic will break out is unclear. Can anyone be certain at this stage that a
collapse like the 1929 crash will not repeat itself? Neither Rubin, nor Greenspan, nor
Camdessus nor anyone else could. Uncertainty is haunting everyone, including the most
outstanding economic analysts. Only that there is a huge difference between now and then.
In 1929, the speculative operations did not account for 1.5 trillion dollars, and barely
3% of the Americans owned shares traded in the stock markets. Today, 50% of the US
population has invested its savings and retirement funds in shares of these stock markets.
I have not devised this, it is no fantasy, read the news. Add to this, if you will, the
fact that the new world order is destroying more than ever the Nature that supports the 6
billion people we are today, and that will be required to support the 10 billion people we
will be in 50 years from now.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Up to here I have done my job. I have just
said to you what has crossed my mind while I was at 10 000 meters altitude (<i>Laughter
and applause</i>). Don&#146;t you ask me about solutions; I am not a prophet. I only know
that the greatest crises have always given rise to the greatest solutions (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I trust in the intelligence of peoples and
men. I trust in the need for humanity to survive. I trust that you, distinguished and
patient members of this Parliament, will reflect upon this issue. I trust you will
understand that this is not a matter of ideologies, races, colors, personal income or
social classes; it is a matter of life or death for us all who sail in the same boat (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Therefore, let us be more generous, more
fraternal, more humane. Let South Africa become a role model for a more just and humane
world of the future (<i>Applause</i>). If you can make it, all of us can (<i>Applause and
acclamations of &quot;Fidel, Fidel, Fidel&quot;</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thank you (<i>Ovation</i>). </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;</font></p>
