Commander-in-Chief Fidel Castro at the autonomous university of Santo Domingo. August 24,
1998</font></strong><font SIZE="5"></p>
</font><font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font face="Arial" size="3">Dear Rector;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Dear and envied young President of the
Dominican students;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Dear friends:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">My visit had necessarily to be short, not
because any time or limit was set to me, but due to the many activities we have at this
moment, especially in this second half of the year, when most of us have not even had a
minute of rest and oftentimes very few hours of sleep. That is why we had to set a limit,
and also be prudent: nobody should overstay his welcome.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Therefore, I really had only two days left
of my visit to the Dominican Republic, the three previous days I attended the CARICOM
multilateral meeting, or rather CARICOM&#146;s meeting with the Dominican Republic, to
which we had the honor of being invited and, along with this, make an official visit. How
many things could I to do in those two days? I could not even do the minimum I had
originally planned, including a possible visit to Montecristi, and comply with official
functions, visit some individuals and meet with the people of Baní.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Before arriving in the Dominican Republic,
we had been reading press dispatches that reported the enormous efforts by the countless
Dominican organizations, solidarity groups, students who had graduated in Cuba and a great
number of friendly groups, everyone asking for a meeting which was absolutely impossible.
That is how the idea came up to hold this meeting that all those organizations could
attend. But meetings of this nature are always a bit more complicated, because it is not
the same to speak to one single organization for hours - this does not mean that I am
going to speak for hours here (<i>Laughter</i>) - that to get them all together.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">While I was writing that dedication - which
came as a surprise to me, for everyone forgot to tell me that I had to write something
here (<i>Laughter</i>) - from the moment I sat down, some people started asking for one
thing and others for another, and someone said, &quot;Make it a political statement&quot;,
and if being political is not always easy, being a revolutionary is still more difficult.
So, under what was actually your inspiration, I had to write a few words for this
institution, where dedications began to be written over 50 years ago, and I, for one, am
satisfied. It has a bit of everything: it is a little bit political and a little bit
revolutionary.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I would be happy if you felt that my
writing in that historical book is not absolutely useless. The great diversity of
personalities and organizations present here made it difficult to just say a few words.
However, they all had something in common: a feeling of friendship.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All of you together have set the country in
motion. The international cables, I usually read them, referred constantly to the many
mobilizations, the signs and slogans in connection with our visit, which gradually created
an international climate seldom reported by the international news agencies. I can say
that the cables I have read here in Santo Domingo give an objective, friendly information
which reflects that climate you have created of an enormous value for this visit, in every
respect.That includes matters related to security, since many of you claimed a willingness
to actively participate in, and take upon yourselves the task of, watching over our
delegation's safety. Also, the major political significance that your expressions of
solidarity in the days prior to our visit are having right now, when they are badly
needed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have found solidarity, great solidarity
in different places that we have visited. What we had never found was such a great
expression of solidarity and such an efficient way of showing it, at such a timely moment
for our country, and in such a mixed up world as we are living in. I simply could not
leave without meeting with you (<i>Prolonged applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was wondering what I should say to you.
There are many topics, an endless number of topics. I could speak about Cuba but we speak
about Cuba every day, and when we do not, others do it for us and against us (<i>Laughter
and applause</i>). I could perhaps then, in a few words, say that Cuba is still there and
it will continue to be there (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Every now and then they publish that Castro
is no longer there, or that Castro's days are numbered. They are such fools and such
idiots (<i>Laughter</i>) that they do not realize that is the least important (<i>Applause</i>).
What would be the worth of a revolution if it depended on Castro or on any single man? (<i>Applause.</i>)
Poor idiots who for so long have applied that concept and believed in it! </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">From the very beginning, in their infinite
plans to eliminate leaders of the Cuban Revolution, I was awarded the honor of being the
first on their list (<i>Laughter</i>). I once jokingly said that I had the undesirable
record, or the inglorious record - well, perhaps it is glorious; but it would be best to
call it the undesirable or strange record - of being the main target of assassination
attempts among all the personalities and politicians that ever existed, at least in this
century and perhaps in many others. They believed in the idea that the end of Castro would
be the end of everything else. They keep asking about Castro's health, or disseminating
news, almost weekly or every two weeks, of his demise, or predicting diseases, or
calculating his age (<i>Laughter</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is said a lady should never be asked
about her age. We politicians might be considered some sort of ladies (<i>Laughter and
applause</i>) who do not like to be reminded of our age. It is not out of vanity, no. It
is simply upsetting not to be able to continue fighting and annoying them for a much
longer period of time (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But these are matters of personal liking
that have nothing to do with the philosophy of life, politics and history. That is why I
said that, of all the predictions, that was least important.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They have little time to turn back the
pages of history and recall the past. The march of history is adamant. We have had so many
setbacks since last century? So many leaders were dead! However, that did not stop our
country's history of struggles.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I concede that at a certain time, certain
people can play a certain role. However, I hold this as a relative truth. Actually, I
believe the role that any man has played at any time has always depended on circumstances
that had nothing to do with the man himself.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If Bolivar had been born in 1650 or 1700 no
one would known the name Bolivar. Only a century later, and when new ideas keep emerging
as a result of serious problems that have been accumulating for a long time, the big
changes and their protagonists are possible. If it had not been for the historical process
that preceded the French Revolution, who would have ever heard of Danton, Robespierre,
Mirabeau and all those individuals with an intense but short life because, according to in
Saturn's legend, the revolution devoured its own children. There was an abbot who became
famous because when someone asked him what he had done during the revolution, he answered,
&quot;Stay alive&quot; (<i>Laughter</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is that men who play a role, depend
completely on events that have nothing to do with their personal ability that can only
show under certain circumstances. That is what happened with the forefathers of our
independence and all personalities throughout history. Previous conditions are required
for which no man take credit.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Martí, when was he born? At the right
moment, the right day, the right hour, the right minute, the right second; had he been
born a century before, perhaps Marti's name would have never been heard of. That is also
the case with Máximo Gómez, to whom we paid a well-deserved tribute, but still short of
the enormous tribute he deserves.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The association of historical events with
specific people has long been rooted in the propaganda and even in the conception of
reactionaries, imperialists and enemies of the Revolution. Thus they speak about Castro's
Revolution, they personalize it: Castro did this, Castro did that. The person who least
believes that, and I am being completely honest, the one who has never believed that,
really, that&#146;s me. I think that I am one of those who have never felt that way.
It&#146;s a matter of life perception and of watching history in a philosophic way. People
are a different thing. One day we said this phrase: Men die, but the people is immortal (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We do not mind their predictions, their
concerns. Presently, when all their plans have failed, when all their lies and wishful
thinking have been ridiculed, they are trying to figure out what lies ahead for Cuba as
the laws of biology take their toll. We are not worried about what will happen in Cuba,
because we shelter no doubts about what will happen in Cuba. What we are asking ourselves,
and it is what these wishful thinkers should be asking themselves, is what will happen in
the world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Cuba's modest work will live on with the
revolutionary spirit that made it possible. But the history of our country, just like your
history, your future, will depend on the future of the world. Even the future of the
United States will very much depend on that other future.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In strictly national terms, I can simply
say that our country has resisted, when everyone, everywhere, was predicting the opposite.
After the collapse of the socialist bloc and the demise of the USSR, where we had our
markets and our main supplies of fuel, raw material, etc. those trade relations we had
managed to establish on equitable bases were lost overnight. They had enabled us to
confront the U.S. blockade for many years, and not only confront it, but advance in many
fields, some of which you have mentioned here.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The demise of the socialist camp had them
dreaming that the demise of the Cuban Revolution was a matter of days, of weeks at the
most. They saw the European socialist countries collapse one after the other and they were
expecting to read in the papers the news of Cuba's collapse, which was not a baseless
assumption.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They did not need for those countries to
collapse, but the collapse of Cuba they needed it. Those countries were a lot more
developed, had a lot more resources than we did, still when they renounced socialism the
West immediately lifted the blockade and other restrictions, offered them loans,
assistance and, above all, recipes, and more recipes; they received the worst poison.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When we saw that and we analyzed the whole
process, the fundamental elements and causes and the way things were unfolding, we foresaw
the disappearance of the Soviet Union. Two years before it happened, at a 26th of July
rally, in Camagüey province, I said something that left everyone there sort of amazed and
confused. I said, &quot;And if one day we wake up to find that the Soviet Union has
disappeared, we will continue fighting, and we will continue building socialism&quot; (<i>Applause
and exclamations</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Yes, that immense, rich and powerful
country collapsed and an economy comprehensively built in over 70 years was disjointed. It
had been a country where a republic produced certain things while others produced others,
they exchanged products and produced many things in cooperation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Overnight, we lost the market for many
million tons of sugar which enjoyed a preferential price, obtained by our Revolution with
arguments and reasons, since we had discovered that the prices of products exported by the
more developed countries did not stop increasing while those of the products exported by
our countries kept falling. If we signed for the volumes and prices of the goods to be
exchanged in a five year period, for the imported products we did it on the basis of
prices close to those of the world market and the purchasing power of our products, after
five years it was a lot less than it had been at the beginning of the five years period.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Meanwhile, the price every machine, every
equipment, every product that we imported was higher and the price of our sugar - our main
export item - was still that of the world market plus a preferential premium, and the
price of other commodities remained the same they had been the first year of the
agreement.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Added to this, one day the price of oil
surged, it jumped to huge figures. By then, however, we had reached an agreement based on
sliding prices. We said that if we were talking proletarian internationalism then the
prices of our products, especially sugar, must increase as the prices of your export
products increase (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How far up did the price of sugar climb
then? It was between 25 and 30 cents a pound. Theirs, which was beet sugar, cost even more
and with that we were able to pay for the oil and other products. But, it was mainly with
sugar that we could pay for the oil whose price had increased 12 to 14 times. After the
oil prices boom, less than a barrel of oil could be bought with what could buy a ton of
oil before the Revolution's triumph.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Imagine what it means for a country to
loose such fair and reasonable trade relations, plus the market. All the machinery, or the
vast majority of the tractors, trucks and equipment we had, originated there. It is true
they used up a lot of fuel more than other from the West, but that was not a big problem
because the ships with the fuel followed right behind the equipment. And when there was a
hurricane or a pest - like those introduced in our country that more than once damaging
sugarcane or other crops - the agreed products never failed to reach our country. The
agreements were rigorously observed as if protected by a guarantee clause.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We received credits. And, mark my words:
with 1 hectare of well-cultivated cane, we could buy up to 30 tons of rice. It was an
excellent exchange, because they had some rice surpluses and they sold it at the
international price. Our export prices basically fluctuated in conjunction with the oil
prices, and with a 10 tons of sugar yield from 1 hectare of sugarcane, we could buy up to
30 tons of rice, wheat or other important foods.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That revenue enabled the country to advance
its economic and social development program.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is much talk outside our country
about our education system, health care and even sports. Yes, that is true but there is no
talk about the tens of thousands of kilometers of highways that have been built. No one
speaks about the many dams built all over the country and that, from 35 million cubic
meters of water capacity we started out with, we now have over 10 billion. We were
applying the most advanced technical programs in sugarcane and rice cultivation because
not all the rice came from the Soviet Union, a significant part we produced ourselves and
we were planning to grow all of the rice we needed by using flat terraces, increasing
yields, cutting down costs and using water more efficiently.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is never said that we mechanized the
sugar cane harvest, where more than 300,000 workers worked before the Revolution, if only
for three or four months a year, and that after the Revolution they found permanent jobs.
That cane-cutters work force disappeared. It was replaced, first, by the mechanical cane
haulers, and then by the harvesting machines, which cut and hauled the cane and, really
raised productivity.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is not said that many trades in our
country were mechanized: rice was cut with the famous sickle when the Revolution triumphed
but later it was all cut with machines. Construction work was manual, it was all
mechanized afterwards. Transportation was done with oxen - a good deal of it -, all of it
was mechanized. Electric energy reached only 50% of the population, electrification now
benefits over 90%. Sugar was hauled on people's back in 250 pound bags, which at a time
weighed 300 pounds. No one knows the number of people who later developed back problems.
All sugar shipments, millions of tons per year, were mechanized, except for those destined
to small countries that do not have facilities to receive bulk sugar, in which case, a
certain amount of bags, a minimum amount, had to be hauled manually.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Work was extraordinarily humanized thanks
to the Revolution. Electrical energy capacity was multiplied tenfold or more than tenfold
while, new mechanical industries were created. We now manufacture our sugarcane harvesting
machines. We were even manufacturing bulldozers, although part of the components were
imported, but it considerably reduced costs. We were producing forklifts and other
equipment, creating jobs and reducing the country hard currency spending. We manufacture
the main components for the sugar factories. We were already manufacturing up to 70% of
components for the sugar factories, even if we had to import 30% in centrifuges and
certain equipment and components that we were not able to produce in our country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We developed science at a very quick pace,
and there is hardly any talk about this. Today we have thousands of scientists, because,
aware of that sector&#146;s importance, even under the &quot;special period&quot;, we have
continued to carry out scientific research. At this moment, research is proceeding on
candidate vaccines against AIDS, even against cancer. This in addition to great number of
new medicines and vaccines, some of them solely made and developed in our country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am not going to refer to the number of
houses we built. Foremost, we had already achieved a 4 million tons per year in cement
production capacity and enough building material to build 100,000 houses per year when,
unfortunately, the &quot;special period&quot; set in. We had not been wasting our time.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I must honestly say though, that the
abundance of available resources did not help develop our thrifty habits. I cannot deny
that there were even some who rode the tractor to go visit a girlfriend. This might be
great for romance, but from the economic view point is disastrous (<i>Laughter and
applause</i>). Our domestic consumption was then 13 million tons of fuel per year.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That degree of development we had reached
became a terrible liability with the collapse of the socialist camp and the USSR,
especially that of the USSR which seemed to be unyielding. It had resisted the first
intervention after the World War I which had turned the country into a wrecked piece of
land. Then, it was again destroyed before twenty years had passed, totally destroyed,
sustaining the loss of 20 million people; a country which had defeated Nazism.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Those who read the new histories that are
been written should not believe that some small ships arriving through Murmansk in convoys
from the West, or some raw material or equipment arriving through Iran, made the
difference. It was the hundreds and thousands of factories that during the war, and even
before the war, had been transferred to Siberia, many of which began producing in the
winter when they still lacked a roof. It was the will of a people that had lived under a
certain social regime, regardless of the enormous mistakes that were made, mainly
subjective mistakes - we do not need to name them, they are well-known. It was a people
that for the first time had been the owner of all the riches, peasants who became owners
of the land and workers who became owners of the factories, because there had been a
social change and that people had developed a great capacity for struggle and a great
selflessness.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When every other country in Europe
surrendered to the first shots, the USSR - despite huge political errors committed before
that war, and huge military errors, such as having the defense forces totally demobilized
while three million troops and tens of thousands of tanks were being concentrated next to
their border doing the incredible, that is, launching a surprise attack that destroyed
thousands of aircraft on the ground the first day, thousands of aircraft, thus opening the
way to the rapid advance of the armored divisions, when the troops were not even
mobilized; those were serious mistakes by the leaders, very serious mistakes, which were
paid for dearly - the USSR was the only country which resisted, on and on. The other
countries, as soon as their lines were broken by a few divisions, sat down to negotiate in
all different places. But that is another story.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thus, it seemed impossible that that
country, which despite so much destruction had attained nuclear parity in a short period
of 20 to 25 years and that could not be conquered by Hitler with his millions of soldiers,
could be destroyed by the West without firing a single shot, conquered without firing a
single shot. We could foresee what was going to happen and, unfortunately, it did.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I said that the recipes were the worst. As
a result of those recipes Russia's GDP - not the USSR's any more but Russia's - has been
dropping yearly to 45% of what it produced in 1989, before the USSR's dissolution and the
beginning of the capitalist construction. The Russian Federa-tion produced between 400 and
500 million tons of oil per year, all the gas they wanted to meet their demand and export
a considerable volume to the West, steel, raw materials, which Cuba would have to do
without. They kept the factories of spare parts for trucks, machinery, all kinds of
equipment, which Cuba was left without.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our production, which dropped to 65%, began
to recover despite lacking all those things. Today we are up to around 76%, it is not 45%,
and we are making progress although it will take some time before we can make a comeback.
Ours is a blockaded country, a doubly blockaded country: the old blockade tightened and
the new unexpected blockade which left us with the fuel-wasting equipment but without the
oil tankers coming from the Soviet Union, nor the food that used to arrive, nor the prices
for our sugar, not even the markets for that sugar. We were left without something as
vital as fuel, when over 90% of the country had been electrified. If electrification had
only been 50% it would have been less difficult. All the achievements of more than 30
years became an additional liability in those circumstances. When people get used to
certain services like electricity, considered essential, there is no going back. You can
serve it by quotas, do other things - you have gone through this - blackouts and similar
things which had ceased to exist in our country a long time ago.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A significant merchant fleet had been
created in the country, also a high seas fishing fleet and for transportation. Practically
all manual work had been mechanized. The hard physical work that our workers used to do no
longer existed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How could the country be saved under such
circumstances? Those in the North tightened the screws when they perceived these objective
realities. A building resting on two pillars had lost one. The other pillar, however, was
the people, our people&#146;s consciousness (<i>Applause</i>), its ability to struggle, to
resist, its heroism. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our Revolution was not an imported product.
It was a product created by our people. Ninety percent of the weapons we won the war with
had been seized from the enemy (<i>Applause</i>). Nobody supplied us with weapons, and
only now and then we got a few (<i>From the audience they say, &quot;Cuba, dignity of
America!&quot;</i>) (<i>Applause</i>). It was a genuine revolution, an authentic
revolution, our people's revolution, it wasn't exported to us or waged for us. We did not
even have any relations with the USSR, not because we were prejudiced, rather because we
took into account the international situation with the cold war.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We tried to purchase the first weapons from
a country in Western Europe, Belgium. They were weapons to defend ourselves by using our
experience in guerrilla warfare, since it would not have being possible to resist an
American attack with conventional methods. The first ship arrived and there were no
problems but when the second ship arrived and it was being unloaded by hundreds of workers
and soldiers, there was a terrible explosion. Then, when people surged to rescue the
victims, there was another explosion: more than 100 people died, hundreds were injured.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Those were the first weapons we bought in
the West, in order not to give a pretext to the gentlemen in the North. Some cannons were
bought in Italy with their corresponding ammunition. Pressure began and the cannons
arrived but hardly with any ammunition. As we had gotten only a small amount of
ammunition, the deliveries were cut off while the threat of aggression was over us from
the very moment we enacted the land reform law.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Bay of Pigs invasion was not conceived
in the United States because we had proclaimed the socialist nature of Revolution. It was
conceived immediately after we passed the Land Reform Law in May 1959. Since there were
large American estates comprising tens of thousands of hectares each, and some of them
even up to 200,000 hectares, one single transnational company, the war to the end was
immediately decided. The Revolution had to be destroyed. What is this about letting land
reforms hurt the interests of American companies? Have not these guys learned the
Guatemala lesson?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today we know very well the cost of that
lesson: over 100,000 people vanished, around 150,000 dead, mostly as a result of
repression, especially the vanished and many of the dead. One hundred and fifty thousand
lives was the toll of that expedition against Jacobo Arbenz. We knew that story well. We
were trying to get weapons for the people because we knew the recipe. They were the ones
who could not tell the difference between the situation in Guatemala and in Cuba, where
there had been a victorious revolution against forces organized, supplied and trained by
the United States, 80,000 troops, finally defeated with just 3,000 weapons, 25 months
after the <i>Granma</i> landing.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They did not realize that the people were
in command. There is the historic experience of what the people can do and you know it
because if there has been a country in this hemisphere with a difficult and hazardous
history it is this fraternal Dominican country (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You have even gone through the experience
of fighting against 40,000 American troops landing in your own territory (<i>Applause</i>),
and you were not defeated. They could not defeat the people and the military who took
sides with the people, whose most outstanding figure whom I mentioned in the decoration
ceremony, we will always remember, the figure of Francisco Caamaño (<i>Prolonged applause</i>).
They could not crush you. They had to negotiate, to find a way out, one way or another,
through an inevitable comprise. There were some Latin American countries who even joined
the aggression, some joined that invasion of the Dominican Republic. First, there was the
invasion and then the sanctioning of the invasion by the very famous OAS. It is not
possible to forget that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So aggressions against Cuba began due to a
land reform law. Of course, for every measure the United States took, Cuba responded with
a countermeasure: Suspension of the sugar quota, nationalization of certain companies (<i>Applause</i>);
total suspension, total nationalization (<i>Applause</i>). Many landlords and very rich
Cubans, believed it would be a matter of days, because people have theirs beliefs, right?
(<i>Laughter</i>), and the belief then was that it was impossible: &quot;A revolution
right next to the United States? Oh, forget it!&quot; Many of them practically took a
vacation waiting for our neighbors to do away with us. The big mansions were left empty.
What did we do? Bring one hundred thousand scholarship students into the vacationists'
houses! (<i>Laughter and applause.</i>) We did not take anybody's house, not at all! They
went on vacations, and since their vacations were extended indefinitely... (<i>Applause</i>).
The houses are there, preserved and kept at the service of the nation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now the Helms-Burton Act says that the
owners of those houses are Americans, therefore, the law applies also to those properties
and other vacationists&#146; properties. It is incredible, for the first time in history
they receive the category of citizens and the benefit of the law. Even Clinton himself
once said that it was madness, and he should know about madness (<i>Laughter and
exclamations of &quot;Fidel! Fidel!&quot;</i>). Of course, I do not mean to offend him
because I do not want to side with the far right in that country. I think I have made
myself clear about that when I say how I feel. I do not mean to offend him but that is
what he said.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What the Helms-Burton Act was claiming
before they lift the blockade, would cost Cuba 100 billion dollars. Listen, only if we had
the machine they have in the U.S. treasury to print their green bills! It is preposterous,
a law of an extraterritorial scope to prevent investment in Cuba. Then we look at the US
in amazement and say: Hey, who are the main advocates of socialism in Cuba today? The
United States is (<i>Applause</i>), so much so that it would not want people to invest. As
for us, every time we can we invest something: a piece of socialism.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Where does the irrationality, or the
inconsistency of presenting or doing everything possible to prevent investment in our
country, lead to? How could our country get the resources under such circumstance? I
repeat, how could our country get the resources under such circumstance? Just like the
vast majority of the Third World countries which are not swimming in a sea of oil, which
need technology, and capital. We are not an exception to that rule. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Before the special period, before the USSR
collapsed, we realized that some sectors of the economy could not develop with the only
support of the socialist camp, because they did not have the technology for it. Actually,
eight or nine years before the collapse of the socialist camp we had made the decision to
create joint ventures in some sectors as a complement to the socialist development of our
country. We had been meditating, delving deep into the problem, rationalizing it. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They are trying to suffocate us at all
costs when everything they have tried and all their plans have failed. But they wanted to
take advantage of the special moment. Their other calculations, their other plans had
failed, including the mercenary invasion, which lasted less than 72 hours, because we knew
we could not permit the consolidation of a beachhead. They had a government ready on an
airplane. Using an easy mechanism, they were going to land on an airstrip built by the
Revolution in an inhospitable marshy place. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Revolution had built, in the first
months, three paved roads leading in that direction. They were on marshy land where we had
to dump tons and tons of rock per meter to build a firm foundation. Even a tourist zone
was being developed there, and an airstrip. That was the place they chose, easy to defend,
since to take it back we would have to go through tens of kilometers of mud, along those
paved roads that could be easily blocked.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A big surprise, a new underestimation that
was punished. The American squadron was only three miles away, with aircraft carriers and
all, but they did not have enough time, because attacking all the time, our forces, still
not very experienced in the use of certain weapons, defeated the mercenary expedition in
approximately 68 hours (<i>Applause</i>). The government stayed waiting in Miami. They are
still waiting! (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A dirty war like they waged in Nicaragua.
They managed to organize bandits in every province and mainly in the area of the Escambray
Mountains, which was the zone they were preparing for their projected invasion. But, we
cleaned up the Escambray Mountains and reduced their forces to a minimum. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There was a time when they had around 1,000
counterrevolutionaries there, air supplied. Although some of the weapons fell into our
hands because we had also organized &quot;our bandits&quot; or had infiltrated theirs, or
had formed our own counterrevolutionary organizations. Anyway, the infiltrated
revolutionaries ended up being the heads of the organizations (<i>Laughter and applause</i>).
That was when we had to tell them: &quot;Listen, do not overdo it&quot;. They were
rendering different services and all, they were really outstanding.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The forces which defended the Revolution
learned the ability to fight those bandits. Do you know why? Because they never used
physical violence, I am pleased to say that here today, they never used it. We did not use
it in war times and we have never used it in peace times. We did not use it in the first
years that were the most difficult and we have never used it during the time of the
Revolution, no matter what they say, no matter how much they lie and how much they
slander. Cuba and our people know very well how things are over there and what our ethical
rules are. We will never resort to such procedures. Those who use torture to seek
information never learn anything.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Since our forces followed that rule they
developed that ability, especially to infiltrate the enemy groups. There was a moment when
the CIA and their enthusiastic followers had organized 300 counterrevolutionary
organizations, some of them better-known, more important. Thus, it was a long battle.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">After that, pirate attacks, plans for
direct invasion of Cuba. This is known today thanks to certain documents. What we
denounced then, the plans that the government ordered the Pentagon to elaborate, to
fabricate a pretext for a direct invasion against Cuba. This was after Girón.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All that set the ground for the USSR-Cuba
agreement to deploy strategic missiles in our country. This is a lengthy subject which I
recently talked about with CNN, a major American TV network, in a program where I was
asked many questions and, with the support of documents, I answered them all: What was the
origin of the conflict? What happened? Finally, it was proven; it was true that they were
preparing a direct invasion. That was the origin of the October [Missile] Crisis, an event
I do not want to dwell on right now, it is not my objective.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">After the crisis, again pirate attacks,
sabotages throughout all these years, assassination plans, and now not only those which
were institutionally organized but also those organized by the groups that were trained,
very well trained, and let loose to carry out assassination attempts and personal actions,
covering up U.S. responsibility.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All those groups are made up by the same
people who blew up the plane over Barbados, who participated in the dirty war against
Nicaragua supplying weapons mainly from El Salvador and Honduras, weapons obtained through
the scandalous connection called Iran-Gate which ended up in Central America. It is these
same groups that carry out those apparently independent assassination attempts, but there
is proof that they were tolerated for many years.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is no doubt that the terrorist
actions in our capital aimed at sabotaging tourism and suffocating our country's economy
even more were known and tolerated. It was absolutely impossible to carry them out without
those whose duty it was to prevent them knowing about them, since they were organized from
the United States with Central American mercenaries. It would have been impossible, we
have recent proof of that. A system of terrorism against Cuba was deliberately created in
which everyone was responsible but no one was guilty. In other words, the most devilish
mechanisms of dispersing responsibility were created, pursuing the same policy of
harassment to try to annihilate our Revolution.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have lots of information about this, but
I do not want to talk about this subject now. I did not really intend to. I just wanted to
talk about things in Cuba the way I have been doing. I simply want to emphasize that the
main thing is our people. The question is, how is it possible that in such difficult
conditions, of which I have been giving you some facts, our people has been able to
resist?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is in this context that we appraise
those feelings of support and solidarity that so generously and extraordinarily you have
been showing us in the last few days. And you cannot imagine how much this helps us. The
same way the Caribbean people helped us in Jamaica when they greeted us with mass rallies
where we spoke Spanish to English-speaking crowds. Such awareness they showed and such
knowledge! Such a demonstration of their understanding of Cuba's policy of solidarity with
Africa, and of our struggle against apartheid and against its army, one of the most
sophisticated and technically advanced, which was in possession of seven nuclear weapons
when we were fighting against them, at the Angolans' side, in Cuito Cuanavale and close to
the Namibian border. They could not take up this challenge and were forced to negotiate.
Such these negotiations put an end to colonialism in Namibia and stepped up the demise of
apartheid.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today, many in the West speak of apartheid:
it&#146;s great that it disappeared! They speak of that apartheid of which many of them
were accomplices, the same apartheid they never blockaded, the same apartheid which wrote
some of the most shameful, revolting and humiliating pages in modern history. They speak
about it, but they never mention the Cuban fighters involved in that struggle, the Cuban
fighters who died in those battles. They never mention a Caribbean country which sent up
to 55,000 volunteer fighters at the most decisive and critical moments of that war (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The African people does know and it does
not forget. The people of South Africa and their African leaders do know it, and do not
forget it. Others now go to Africa - to countries we contributed to liberate from the
colonial yoke and defended from apartheid with our blood - to invest millions and
billions. Cuba has not gone there, and will not go there, to invest a single penny (<i>Applause</i>).
We invested what we had to invest, what is worth much more than money, much more than all
the transnationals put together: our sweat, our blood and our lives! (<i>Applause and
exclamations of: &quot;Long live revolutionary Cuba&quot;</i>) Such is the country they
want to destroy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">During the final stage of that battle I'm
talking about, since part of our forces were stationed elsewhere, 40,000 Cuban troops and
30,000 Angolans were involved with all their gear, the tanks, the antiaircraft means -
1,000 antiaircraft pieces - against a country that could have used any of the seven
nuclear weapons it had. In this august center I ask myself, did the Americans know it or
not that South Africa had seven nuclear weapons?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They, who know everything or almost
everything, at least in matters of espionage. They, who invest more than 27 billion
dollars per year just in the Central Intelligence Agency, plus what they invest in the
National Intelligence System that no one knows how much it is. It could be between 30 and
40 billions that they invest in the intelligence system, the same that recently claimed to
know that chemical weapons were being produced in a medicine factory and, one by one, the
whereabouts of each member of the groups which they said were responsible for actions that
are, of course, murderous and damnable, as were those terrorist actions in the capitals of
Tanzania and Kenya. They say they know all that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am using this argument to ask myself if
they really did not know that South Africa had seven nuclear weapons. If they did not
know, how could South Africa obtain those weapons? But, the fact remains that the Cubans
were there fighting. They would have perhaps rejoiced if the racists had used any of those
weapons against the Cuban troops!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, we had taken all measures in
case that happened. Our tactic, was to arrange our forces in groups no larger than 1,000
heavily armed men. Every measure was taken while they advanced in order to reduce to a
minimum the risk of such a weapon being used against them in case the enemy had been able
to break our antiaircraft barriers and managed to obtain an air supremacy which was
already ours, thanks to our pilots who would fly very low, almost 1,000 kilometers an hour
speed at an altitude of 40 or 50 meters.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our combatants managed to gain air
supremacy. They had the necessary weapons to counteract an attack of that nature. But
those who know everything, did not know it. We are absolutely convinced that they did know
it but that did not help them prevent the defeat of the powerful apartheid army.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Not only the African people, other peoples,
the Caribbean peoples, did they not prove it? Yesterday, I spoke about the airport in
Grenada that has proven to be vital for the quick economic development that island is
having. They had excellent conditions for tourism, but they did not have an airport. The
Cuban designers worked it out, it was almost built over the sea. We recently had the
opportunity to see it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It was almost complete when the well known
invasion took place. There, with great fanfare to humiliate us, the gentleman who ordered
the invasion also landed. Not much time had passed, just a few years, and the Grenadians
received us there, recently (<i>Applause</i>). They received our delegation with
extraordinary affection. In that same airport, they have placed a plaque dedicated upon
our arrival, to the memory of the builders who worked at that airport, some of who died
when that unjustifiable, treacherous attack was launched against Grenada.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">One must have faith in history. One must
have faith in the peoples. That encourages us in this fight, and teaches us. Do not think
those are simply signs that can be erased, or simple slogans or words blown away by the
wind. No, they are like hurricanes that can fell the biggest obstacles. They are like
hurricanes in the conscience of the American people. They are like hurricanes of universal
conscience. They are like lie-sweeping hurricanes. Because the peoples who act like that
and the peoples that under a deluge of lies and slanders dare to support a country like
Cuba, they make an impression. This shows in the way international agencies present it
and, curiously enough, in the way certain U.S. television networks have broadcast the
message.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They realize that they are efforts are
pointless, that time passes and their campaigns are weaker instead of stronger; time
passes and the peoples&#146; consciousness grow; time passes and the peoples come closer
together; time passes and the peoples with modest resources available to them are
organizing themselves, to act, to speak up and to make others listen.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What I am saying here is what all Cubans
feel. It is also a proof that we are aware of the great value of your solidarit y, as an
effective means of defense, of protection even - as you yourselves said - against insane
plans. I have not wanted to address the mad plans. I have a lot of information about all
that but I did not want to say a single word that because I did not want that type of
denunciation to affect in any way the mood or the positive atmosphere in the functions and
the international meetings that were going to be held here. We are aware of disdainful
ideas expressed about the Dominican people, the Dominican authorities and the Dominican
security forces by the authors of such plans.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I feel the obligation of expressing here,
very honestly and frankly, as I always do, that the authorities and the security forces
have done an excellent job concerning the measures that made impossible the wild, crazy
plans of those who spent many years learning to kill and to set up bombs (<i>Applause</i>).
It is my duty to also express my acknowledgment to them today.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All these factors combined. The attitude of
the population carries a strong weight, puts a strong pressure. Although the unscrupulous
elements, so common in terrorist groups, do not care much about that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is why the combination of all these
factors: the public opinion, the tremendous moral pressure of the people, the concrete
organizational measures taken, have eliminated the hopes of those who underestimated the
country. I think that in their statements - I have some of them here - and in what they
said, they were really hurting the country's honor, and not only the honor of the
Dominican people but the honor of the authorities, the honor of the forces in charge of
preserving security. Only their underestimation could make them believe that this was the
perfect time and place to do it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Why? Why should they underestimate the
Dominicans' honor, dignity and responsibility? For this became a sort of battle in which
they were intent on proving that it was so, that they could carry out their plans while
the people and the authorities were intent on proving that the Dominican Republic deserved
respect and was capable of preventing such an outrage to its sovereignty and prestige. A
vandalic act of the kind would have brought great harm to the country, to its tourism, to
the nation's international prestige, a very important thing that had to be defended as an
unassailable trench (<i>Applause</i>). All have acted in unison to accomplish that
mission, and all together have succeeded (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">(<i>Someone from the audience yells out
something.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I would have preferred to be born in the
21st Century (<i>Laughter and applause</i>). This one is very interesting; but I'll tell
you a few things later. (<i>Someone from the audience says: &quot;You have helped us a
lot!&quot;</i>) No, you have helped us! (<i>Applause.</i>) I wish we could really have
helped you. This is a people that I really love, that I really admire, to whom I am
grateful. The first thing we read is the history of Cuba and we know about the
participation of this fraternal people in our independence struggle. We know of Marti's
deep affection for this country. We know that the Montecristi Manifesto was written here.
And, we know and cannot forget that Gómez and Maceo set off from here for that epic war
of 1895. And, it is not only what they did but the example they set for us, the ideas they
left us as a legacy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was trying to show yesterday what Marti's
most intimate thought were, his ideas on the world, his ideas on Latin American. And he
expressed them little by little, especially as the beginning of the war got nearer, and he
expressed them more and more clearly.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Although he said that it had had to be done
in silence, he could no longer keep silent. Anyone can follow his writings and see what he
said one day and what he said another, and how he referred to the mighty power that was
emerging without naming it, when he expressed his anguish and his determination to prevent
this hemisphere from being devoured by that power. Until finally, the day before his
death, 24 hours before his death, he writes it, he names that power: &quot;All that I have
done till now, and will continue to do, has been to prevent through Cuba's independence
that the United States expands and falls with that additional force over our American
nations&quot; (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">He was very clear and final the day before
his death when he spoke from his heart on what he felt deep inside, and said this phrase:
&quot;It has had to be done in silence¼&quot; He was so intelligent, he understood that
if he revealed such ideas before the time was ripe, it would be impossible to realize
them. He was organizing the expedition, buying weapons; but at that moment he says it
clearly.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">He knew that it was basic then to organize
the fight for independence, to organize the forces, coordinate them all, provide them with
weapons and begin the struggle for a short war, as bloodyless as possible. That he
proclaimed in the Montecristi Manifesto, although as he wrote it the ships with almost all
of the weapons had already been seized. He set out with his bare chest full of his ideas.
He set out full of faith in his people. He set out full of faith in those heroic warriors,
especially in that extraordinary commander who was Máximo Gómez.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Yesterday, I wanted to expose the ideas
those men fought for, the ideas for which they sacrificed so much, the broad scope of
their cause. And how sad when an amendment was imposed, after dismissing the soldiers of
the Liberation Army and liquidating, in the context of a Constitutive Assembly, the party
created by Martí. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">An amendment, not even a law, something
they usually do. It was something they attached to a law, an appendix which gave them the
right to intervene in Cuba's internal affairs. It was a right they printed in the
Constitution of our alleged sovereign republic, plus a naval base in one of the country's
best harbors. That military base is still there and nothing has been said about when it
will be returned.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Since madness cannot last forever, and
imperialism will not last forever either, not a single drop of blood will be shed for that
base.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It has always been clear to us that blood
need not be shed for a piece of territory that sooner or later will be returned to the
homeland or to mankind (<i>Applause</i>). In any event, if a drop of blood is shed, it
should be shed for the good of mankind and for the planet off which the human family must
live. And, it will live one day under principles which will not be ruthless exploitation
and selfishness, which will not be inequality and injustice; they will be brotherhood,
true brotherhood, fraternity and justice among all human beings on this planet. That is
really worth any sacrifice.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Since we believe in that future, we might
say like Allende: &quot;Rather sooner than later&quot;, that world will come (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That was the intervention. That was the
trick they played on our country. Then they bought everything, they took possession of
everything. By distorting our history, they began by creating an anti-national attitude.
We owed everything to the &quot;generosity&quot; of the United States, they said. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They had showed up after 30 years of heroic
struggle by our people, which had sacrificed the life of hundreds of thousands of its
children. It was only after Spain had been defeated, because Spain could not keep up the
fight, that they intervened and occupied our island. It can be historically and
mathematically demonstrated that Spain could not keep fighting in Cuba. Following the
occupation of our island, they occupied the Philippines, and then, our beloved sister, the
island of Puerto Rico (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are very happy to remember Puerto Rico
here. They have just given the world an impressive lesson. What the Puerto Rican people
have just done, a hundred years later, will have to be recorded with golden letters in the
annals of neo-liberalism.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are talking about commemorations and,
that unanimous movement, that Puerto Rican strike in Spanish... (<i>Applause and
exclamations of: &quot;Independence for Puerto Rico!&quot;</i>) See how, after 100 years
of English, the Puerto Rican people stands up to defend its culture, its language and its
patriotic feelings that cannot be destroyed. There is something behind that attitude and
that is a feeling of national pride. What were they fighting against? Against what is most
fashionable in the world now: the privatization of a telephone company.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Everybody is selling everything everywhere.
We also have had to sell part of our telephone system to keep it from becoming a museum
piece, and to expand communications and modernize them. This is something for which we do
not have any capital. We have had to sell a piece of the enterprise, as part of a
carefully analyzed and well calculated plan, due to our need for technology and capital
that we cannot easily obtain right now. They have organized a national strike. At an
economists meeting, I first heard the news from a Puerto Rican economist about the idea of
a general strike and I was really amazed because a unanimous strike has never occurred in
any Latin American country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Everyday an enterprise is auctioned off
and, they who live there under the dominion of the neoliberal power par excellence, have
opposed the privatization of an enterprise. It is an example, and I would say that it is
the best tribute, or the best reminder, the best warning and message that the Puerto Rican
people could have conveyed a 100 years after the island's occupation by US troops.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They used more subtle methods in our
country. They took hold of all of the economy, the best lands, the factories. They imposed
a Constitution and an amendment to it. It must have been a source of deep suffering for
Máximo Gómez and others!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Martí, Maceo, Agramonte and hundreds of
heroes were already dead. They were spared that anguish, that suffering. They had had
faith in their people and its ability to overcome all the obstacles, all the setbacks.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Those who had fallen before were well aware
of the stumbling blocks that could appear. More than one of those fighters, like Máximo
Gómez, had been through the terrible Zanjón Pact when divisions within the Cuban forces
- as Martí said - caused the demoralization that led the army to surrender before the
full independence of the country had been attained.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Every time something like this happens, it
pleases us to remember those who gave their lives to achieve these objectives.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is why we dislike and oppose the
individualization of merits. We always remember - particularly in my case, for the many
years I have had the privilege of participating in this struggle - many comrades who were
killed since the very first days of the revolutionary struggle. We also cherish the sacred
memory of those who, since last century, have fought and fell so that there might be today
an independent country called Cuba (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I said a long time ago - today, in fact (<i>Laughter</i>)
- that the important question is not what will happen in Cuba but, what will happen in the
world. I cannot give you a categorical, accurate response, but I can make some categorical
affirmations. The so-called new order - every now and then a new order appears -, this
neo-liberal order their trying to impose on the world is not sustainable. To be exact, the
neo-liberal globalization is not sustainable (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This is a major starting point and an
encouraging element to us all in this struggle, because the fight is not pointless, the
fight is not for a single country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today, by force, the struggle of any
country, any people, especially the Third World peoples, becomes a struggle for the whole
world, a universal struggle. Any contribution to the struggle counts, however modest. Some
can do more, some less, depending on certain factors and circumstances.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was saying, and I have said it in Geneva
and in many other places, that something cannot be denied: globalization is inevitable. It
is a product of history, of the development of productive forces, as Marx said in his
times. Those were times, of course, when many of today&#146;s problems were not known and
could not be known. He had great foresight. He perceived a law in the development of human
society and he devoted much of his life to study this law, and to study capitalism which
he knew better than Friedman and better than those in the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund and all others.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The man who best knew capitalism was Carl
Marx (<i>Applause</i>). Listen to what I am going to say, Isa Conde and the others, I hope
you forgive me. Marx knew more about capitalism than he did about socialism, because Marx
conceived socialism as a society that would come afterwards. He did not try to describe
how a socialist system would be, and even less to say how a socialist Constitution should
be. He was well aware it was not his task. His task was to thoroughly study a social
system, a historic law. He was absolutely certain that that society would inevitably have
to be replaced by another, and not because of anybody's whim, nor because of anybody's
wish, but as a real and objective need of human development.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">He criticized the utopian socialists. I
count myself among those he criticized, and rightly so. Because before I read the first
Marxist document, while studying the political economy they taught at the university,
which had a broad scope - I had a very punctilious professor who was not a Marxist but who
explained the different economic theories and concepts, and he spoke to us about the
surplus production crises, the unemployment and all those problems which awakened my
interest in the subject and led me to meditate a lot about it - I by myself reached the
conclusion that that system was chaotic, absolutely chaotic. That is the reason why I
became sort of a utopian communist, an individual who begins to imagine a different, more
just society. Of course, I knew about justice and injustice, although I did not grow up as
a proletarian. I grew up in my house as the son of a landowner.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Fortunately, I did not grow up in an
aristocratic neighborhood. I lived in the countryside, I mean, really in the countryside.
All my friends, all the people I knew were the children of farmhands. They were the ones I
played with, hung around with. I had not the slightest chance of developing bourgeois or
high-class feelings. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I knew nothing about politics, but I could
see all those things, the kind of life led by the workers and poor peasants who lived
there, in a place where the owner of the land was really a generous man, a Spanish
immigrant who had been recruited and taken to fight as a soldier against Cuba's
independence. He was dragged away from the Spanish countryside the way other Spanish
peasants were. It would not be at all strange if my father had been in the Jucaro-Morón
line of fortresses - which I think was one of the places where he was stationed -, on some
of the occasions when Máximo Gómez or other Cuban military leaders crossed it. He was 16
or 17 years old at the time.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Once they were asking all the party members
- something I consider a bad habit - what their class background was, and when it was my
turn to answer I said: &quot;Grandson of poor peasants&quot; (<i>Laughter and applause</i>).
My grandparents did not even have enough to feed their children.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">After the war, when my father was
repatriated to Spain, he emigrated to Cuba and started to work in lands owned by the
United Fruit Company. At that time, those people were cutting the mahogany trees and other
precious wood to use as firewood in the sugar mills they were building there. They
destroyed the forests and everything. That is another debt they have, at least with me,
that they turned my father into a woodcutter of precious wood to use as fuel and to clear
the forest.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That was the story. My parents always lived
in the countryside, they were semi-illiterate. My father and mother learned how to read
and write by themselves, after they were adults. That was one reason my mother, who
suffered for it, was so intent on having her children study. Actually, her efforts were
greater her children&#146;s (<i>Laughter</i>). But, for one reason or another, some of us
became more interested.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They did not live in a bourgeois
neighborhood. They did not live in Vista Alegre, Santiago de Cuba, the neighborhood of the
rich so, I had nowhere to get that mentality. Later, the things I remembered, as I came
into contact with political ideas and especially when I began to come into contact with
socialist ideas, helped me draw my own conclusions. When I finally got to the first
documents, it was almost like pouring oil on the flame. This is how I embraced a political
ideology.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Marx talked about the utopian socialists,
but he basically studied the elements I mentioned. Others had to do that, because he did
not like to play the prophet of socialist construction. This opens up a whole new angle,
another field.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Another very important thing: he did not
conceive socialism in one single country. Until the end of World War I, none of the
Marxist authors and theoreticians conceived the idea of socialism in only one country.
They felt it was really impossible, as they were thinking of the development of England,
Germany and the United States. Even after the famous October Revolution, they did not
conceive socialism in that backward country of Europe, the most backward country of
Europe. It was a country with an 80% rural population and a limited intelligentsia,
although very knowledgeable in theory and brilliant thinkers who were familiar with all
the political ideas of the times.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Socialism emerged after a war that
destroyed the few industries they had, some of them important. They tried to build
socialism with an emerging, though very militant, working class and the 80% of rural
workers. Another option was to surrender but they preferred to attempt to build socialism
in that country, a task undertaken when the hopes for revolutions in Germany and other
industrialized countries had been lost. That is the historical truth.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I remember reading that at one point Lenin
thought of building capitalism under the workers&#146; leadership, a workers government.
He said: We have to build capitalism, we have to develop the productive forces. But
harassment, aggressions, isolation and the critical situation were such that he had no
other choice but to accept the challenge. Marx would have held his head in despair,
really.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am not saying they were wrong. I honestly
say that if I had found myself in such a predicament, I would have done just that. It was
really more irrational to believe in the possibility that our Revolution would stand after
the socialist camp collapsed, the unipolar world emerged and the sworn enemy of our
country had become more powerful and stronger than ever, when we could not even count on
any help from abroad. Nevertheless, we said: Let's go ahead. This was eight years ago, or
so, because the problems began to show before 1990.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is not that we are building socialism.
Right now, we are basically defending the sovereignty and independence of our country and
the achievements of socialism. If we can build a little bit of socialism we do it, but
mainly we want to improve what we have done, to achieve excellence. That the over 60,000
medical doctors we have are better doctors.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Just think that under the special period,
we have been able to continue reducing infant mortality rate to 7.2, under the special
period (<i>Applause</i>). Our doctors are certainly better.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our 250,000 to 300,000 teachers are gaining
knowledge everyday. We continue to graduate teachers because some of them retire and we
have a reserve of them so the rest can study. Thousands of teachers have the opportunity
to study full time receiving their salary, which is modest, given our present economic
difficulties. But they are paid their salaries and they can dedicate full time to studying
and upgrading. We are improving our teachers excellence. A better selection is made for
admission to teachers&#146; schools and colleges and we are training them better. The same
we are doing with all of our professionals.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Revolution has graduated 600,000
university professionals, and we find jobs for all of them. If they want to do a different
work, they do some retraining.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">After our development lost its momentum and
the economy declined, we could not ensure the best possible job to every graduate. But,
still the universities were not closed down. A considerable number of students enroll in
the universities every year, now more rigorously selected according to their school
records, vocation and abilities. However, we are not using all the capacity available in
our universities. There are more than 20,000 university professors. Their number has not
declined. They are still there, studying and upgrading themselves.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are using some of the available capacity
in our universities for students of certain countries, not in the amount we would really
wish. There was a moment when our country, as I said yesterday, had 22,000 scholarship
students. It reached that figure unsurpassed by any country, a very high per capita of
scholarship students per citizens of the country. Now, for example, we have some plans for
students of CARICOM countries who have difficulties to study in their countries. These are
very small, geographically isolated countries that cannot have university faculties, and
we have offered them all the scholarships they want. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That will not ruin us. They will have the
same professors who are already there, so there will not be additional costs on that
account. They will use the facilities that already exist, so there will not be any
additional costs on that account, either. There will be costs, however, for their
accommodation. We do this free of charge but we do recommend the countries to send their
students some aid, for their personal expenses, to compensate for the scarcities that even
our students suffer in this period we are living through.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So we are improving our quality. Our
researchers, who are very young, have more experience and increasingly ambitious programs.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have downsized the administration as
much as possible, and we are trying to achieve efficiency with better controls. Since we
have opened our country to entrance and exit by of hundreds of thousands and millions of
people, we are running all sorts of risks: security risks when terrorist plans are
organized abroad to conspire, scheme, introduce explosives. All this becomes easier, but
it is not only that. It is not only things related to security, it is habits and a way of
life. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Tipping had ceased to exist in our country.
Now, based on the habit established in tourist services in the world and the need of an
incentive for the people who work in this sector, additional to their good will, we have
accepted it. It would also be impossible not to, it is a habit, everybody tips - more or
less generously - upon receiving a service. That is inevitable.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have had to accept the free circulation
of hard currency. It came from abroad through different channels and we could not spend
time chasing people who had hard currency. So, we made it legal to have and use hard
currency. It helps in a given situation. We never did this before the special period. Of
course, those that receive it spend it, they buy certain products, and part of the value
is like a sort of aggregated value to help meet the needs for food, medicine, etc., of
those who do not have the privilege of a remittance from abroad.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have had to do many things taking risks
we never had before. We have to be a lot more careful, and we have a lot of trained dogs
that have to learn two things - our dogs, in the special case of our country, need to have
two trades. They have to be experts in detecting drugs and explosives (<i>Applause</i>).
Your do not need dogs to detect explosives, only a small group for a situation like this
of an international meeting. You do not have groups running around, very well stimulated
and trained, desperate because the Revolution has not collapsed, unsatisfied with a
tightened blockade plus an additional blockade when, as I have said more than once, those
who were the pillars of our trade collapsed. Desperate with the Revolution's resistance,
they intensify their plans. You do not have that problem, practically no other country has
it. They want to hurt tourism, they want hurt and discourage foreign investment not to
give the country the slightest chance.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is the reason for all the efforts we
need to make, for all the measures that must be taken, since it is not only with dogs that
their plans are discovered. If there is anything we have learned, it is how to discover
plans. Dogs help, of course. Tourism brings all of these dangers, and foreign investment
too, by creating differences. It undoubtedly promotes corruption. There is the habit of a
commission of such and such an amount so that a company is given preference over another,
all of that. All that forces us to strive for a more efficient organization, for more
efficient audits, and auditors to audit the auditors (<i>Laughter and applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You cannot imagine what this struggle is
like. It is the struggle against all that comes along with the historical social system
that has prevailed in the last few centuries. I should avoid generalities because there
are many strictly honorable, strictly honest investors who do not get involved in such
activities, but some do. You can find all sorts of things.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The country has opened up. It is no longer
a country in a glass case. We have put forward the thesis that virtue should be cultivated
in contact with vice; if not, virtue is in a pure glass case, totally aseptic, without any
pathogenic germs, with a thousand filters that prevent the contaminated air from entering.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This is what I said: Virtue is cultivated
in the struggle against vice. If you are pure in the glass case, when the germs appear,
you might not have enough antibodies.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our people have a lot of moral antibodies
and a consciousness. But there is always a number of persons who are prone to become ill,
ideologically ill. The enemy encourages them, offering its super consumers' society - the
US society is not only a consumers' society but a super consumers' society - as a model,
as a dream, and advertising it through the media. They themselves proclaim this. They
compare incomes in the richest country in the world with those in Third World countries
that still need to develop and are not allowed to. They compare their consumption patterns
and living standards to those of a country like Cuba which has been rigorously blockaded
for almost 40 years, a country that is not even allowed to buy an aspirin.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You have probably heard talk that some
measures, recently mentioned, are allegedly going to liberalize the sales of medicines.
But to buy medicines - they still have not regulated it and are in no rush to do it - the
transactions and the red tape make it almost impossible to buy an aspirin. They have made
it look like they are going to liberalize some aspects, but the truth is that until now
nothing practical has come of it. Then, they tell the blockaded country: Look at
socialism, the people is suffering, that is what the Revolution has led to and they
compare it with what the consumers have in the empire.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is as if they tied somebody's hands and
feet and threw him into the water and said: Look at that guy, he cannot swim! Well, we
have been able to swim, even with our hands and feet tied, and to say: We have things that
you do not have, because there is not a single elderly person sleeping under a bridge and
covered with newspapers (<i>Prolonged applause</i>). We do not have a single illiterate (<i>Applause</i>).
They do not have many illiterates but they do have mostly functional illiterates. Another
type of illiteracy can be terrible, and that is, political illiteracy (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">One often marvels, really, because it is an
intelligent people, no doubt, a working people. But, how can a system keep its people
ignorant of essential values and issues?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Infant mortality rate in Cuba is lower than
in the United States capital (<i>Applause</i>) and survival rates are the same for the
city and the countryside, for blacks, mulattos, dark-skinned and white (<i>Applause</i>).
The United States has a different infant mortality rate for the rich and the poor, for the
white and the black. It depends on the color, the wealth and all of that. Infant mortality
in our country is the same for all (<i>Applause</i>), and the very few maternal deaths are
the same in the city and the rural areas. It is the same for everybody, irrespective of
income, wealth and the rest.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In our country, 85% of the population own
their houses. There is another percentage who lives in houses owned by their work centers.
The family doctor lives in a house that is not his or her own, so if he is transferred he
leaves it to the doctor taking his or her place. There are also the houses belonging to
factories in out of the way places. But, a very high percentage of the population own
their houses so they do not pay rent, nor even taxes.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In the United States you have to pay a lot
more in taxes than what was paid in Cuba as a rent under capitalism. We have many things
in our poor and blockaded country that they do not have, even material things.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our athletes win a lot of gold medals (<i>Applause</i>)
and we do not need to buy athletes from other countries (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Look at the difficult conditions our
peoples have to fight if they have an amateur team. Athletes receive great support in our
country, the opportunity to study in sports schools, to obtain a university degree and a
modest income. All of a sudden one of these athletes is offered 5 million or 10 million
dollars. It is really abusive, immoral that a country should train its athletes for the
enjoyment of its people and that a rich foreign country comes along and buys them. Since
sport has become increasingly professional and the athletes have become a commodity, you
cannot imagine how hard it is for a country to keep up the morale and the patriotic spirit
of its athletes so that they do not sell out for millions of dollars (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are proud to have athletes who have been
offered contracts of up to 40 million dollars to play for five years and they have
refused. All those athletes have is a modest apartment, and they might get to have a
modest automobile as an incentive, as a prize for his or her effort. One marvels at people
who turn down a 40 million dollars offer in a world so alienated by money.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They usually have athletes from all the
countries of the world, but when they manage to bribe a Cuban athlete they proclaim it all
through the world as a humiliation for Cuba.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">More than 800 participated in the latest
competitions. When our athletes went to Puerto Rico for the latest Central American Games,
they tried to take away our athletes by offering lots of money. They even managed to have
tens of them desert, I do not remember the exact number. This time, however, they only
managed three and none of them in the best category. Our boxers, who were there, had won
almost every gold medal so they want to buy them. They always want to buy our athletes.
This is another type of harassment and plunder.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They are opening schools in Latin America
to promote sports prospects, especially for the baseball major leagues. They have
calculated that it costs them more to train an athlete in the United States than in Latin
America. Well, some go over there, and I know you cannot help being pleased. You are
happy, and rightly so, when there is a good pitcher or when a first-class batter hits a
home run over there in the major leagues.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">For us, sport is a show that almost the
whole year round; people want to see their athletes. Some sport competitions last less;
for the volley-ball players, for example, the sport show is shorter. But there is a great
effort to take them away.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They use every means they can to try to
introduce the ideological virus, to divide, to demoralize. And we need to face all these
problems with our openness. But I think we are learning to face everything and also to be
more efficient in everything. The day when we again have relatively abundant resources, we
will possibly be two or three times more efficient than what we were during times of
bonanza, and we will make a better use of our resources. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our excellence is growing in this struggle.
Step by step, despite all the evil laws against us, we are growing. It may be 5%, 3%, 2%,
1.5%, and if some day a very severe drought, a hurricane or any other phenomenon makes us
fall back a point, we will not dismay, we will continue striving. I was telling you that
we have 76% of what we previously had; someday we will climbed back to 100%.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our battle is not only a battle for
survival, it is not just surviving for the sake of surviving, no. It is a battle to take
part in the struggle for a better world (<i>Applause</i>), to participate in that struggle
along with the world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It would be quite an accomplishment for
them to defeat the Cuban Revolution, because in every UN forum, in the UN headquarters and
everywhere else, there is a country present which has been able to resist, a country that
has demonstrated that much can be done with few resources, and its voice is always there.
What would they not do to shut off Cuba's voice in any forum, in WTO or in WHO! </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Cuba is always there calculating how much
they squander in this or that, the cost of a medicine against AIDS, the 10,000 dollars per
year that must be paid for that cocktail that can save the life of an AIDS patient, and
asking them where the Africans are going to get the 300 billion dollars they would need
every year to give that same treatment to over 30 million AIDS patients in Africa.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are many questions to ask them
everywhere and in every forum and many things to denounce to help build the awareness we
need and that the world needs, to find solutions that, I repeat, will not come because
anyone so wishes but because of humanity&#146;s need to survive. Because, what is actually
under discussion is the survival of a species. It is no longer the survival of a
revolution, or an island or a small country. What is being discussed is the survival of
the human species.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I think that the idea of that future world
is the most important and more noble idea that a revolutionary can harbor.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Revolutionaries have always fought for the
future. Máximo Gómez and Martí fought for the future. When Martí died at Dos Ríos he
knew he was dying for the future. He was not concerned with seeing the results of all
that. It would have been extraordinarily useful to have him longer. It can be said that he
died in the prime of youth, when his talent was at its best. They were fighting for the
future.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">To fight for the future does not mean not
to avoid doing everyday what must be done for the present. These two ideas must not be
confused.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is possible for our country, in its
capacity as a revolutionary state, to devote a great part of its efforts to that struggle
for the future, to that struggle against the neo-liberal globalization that is crushing us
all. It is not the struggle against globalization as an inevitable phenomenon, but the
struggle for a more humane and fair globalization.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If they asked the Pope, he would answer:
for the globalization of solidarity. If they asked me, I would say what I most deeply
believe: the only globalization that can save humanity and preserve the human specie, is a
socialist globalization (<i>Applause and exclamations of: &quot;Long live revolutionary
Cuba!&quot;</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Do I say this out of dogmatism? Do I say it
out of ideological fundamentalism? No!, not at all. I say it based on a very deep
conviction. The world cannot be saved if it persists on the course it is following. In my
opinion, there would not be the slightest possibility for the specie to survive; neither
would there be a possibility for that globalization and that new order that they are
establishing to survive. Because the masses explode, because the peoples explode, because
humanity explodes.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Humanity will not put its neck under the
executioner's ax; its preservation instinct, its condition of thinking human beings make
it impossible.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We, therefore, think that in the field of
ideas a big, difficult battle is being waged because when everything is global, solutions
will also have to be global. I say again: it is a sacred duty to do all that can be done
within each person's reach. Now, the great strategic task or the true solutions are global
solutions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The system is not only unsustainable for
reasons of survival; it is not only unsustainable because it is unbearable for the masses.
The fact is that it is inescapably moving toward inevitable crises, and the big changes in
history - as we all know - are always the result of big crises. This does not mean that we
have to wait for the big crisis to start fighting, to do whatever is possible in every
corner of the world. We also have to build an awareness about these problems.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are going to hold a very important
meeting. We are going to gather eminent economists of Latin America and the world in
January, to discuss the issue of globalization and neo-liberalism. We want to clarify
concepts and to have people from the Friedman school, from neo-liberalism and all other
schools to speak there. A real debate, that has not taken place anywhere, to clarify and
pinpoint concepts.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That meeting will be held in Cuba on the
initiative of an organization of Latin American economists. The idea emerged in a meeting
we had there to analyze economic issues. We proposed what, in our view, is the most
important issue today: neo-liberal globalization, or globalization and neo-liberalism, and
let the results be the fruit of discussion, not of one speech after another. A
presentation by the scholars and a questions and answers section for all those who want to
ask them. A debate. We are planning to have many scholars. There should be at least 40
presentations on the subject and I imagine that hundreds of questions, and a debate.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When we were dealing with the foreign debt,
thousands of people took part in discussions at the Convention Center or in a big theater
and it was an endless chain of speeches. On this occasion, it will have to be a limited
number of presentations, some time for discussions and clarifications, with no more than
600 participants. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are many schools and many criteria.
The only thing I have found all these economists to have in common, again, the only thing
I have found all these economists to have in common, including the pundits who advocate
neo-liberalism and the neo-liberal globalization, is their uncertainty. Take good note of
this word: uncertainty (<i>Laughter and applause</i>). Do not forget that word. There is
not a single one of them without uncertainty.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Let me tell you that, without any need for
espionage, just by talking with many people in the world who talk with many others, by
talking with individuals who have relations, by reading and analyzing every single word
they say; by reading and analyzing what brilliant, eminent analysts write, on one side and
the other, those in favor of neo-liberal globalization and those against it, the only
thing one finds is that terrible thing called uncertainty.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I do not remember it right this minute but
I am sure many of you do, What was the sign that according to Dante was written at the
entrance of hell? How is it possible that no one here knows it! Someone must know it. (<i>Someone
from the audience says something.</i>) Oh! yes: &quot;Abandon all hope!&quot; At the
entrance of this world order that they are trying to impose on us, of this globalization
they have designed, you can put up these two signs: &quot;Total uncertainty&quot;,
&quot;Abandon all hope&quot; (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They are scared. They know that the system
is a twin or inseparable sibling of the crises. They have really invented a lot of things,
but it is easier to find the cure for cancer or AIDS. We are certain that a cure will be
found for these diseases but, for this chaotic, absurd, wild system, or rather, for the
consequences of the system, there will be no cure.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The things they make up are incredible. We
have seen them these days when the crises began, from the Mexican to the Russian crisis -
which is the next to next to last of the next to next to last of the next to next to last.
The crisis that began in Mexico and affected some countries of Southeast Asia and then
others, and that has Japan in terrible conditions, that has put Russia in a catastrophic
situation, and that is tremendously threatening, like a big sword of Damocles pending from
a fragile thread, the economies of Brazil, Argentina and the other countries of Latin
America and the Third World, including the place where it began, which is Mexico.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The great theoreticians and designers of
this world order are afraid of that spreading fire that keeps spreading.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was saying that there is doubt,
uncertainty. The chairman of the International Monetary Fund - I was going to tell you
before - has great doubts. The chairman of the United States Federal Reserve, Greenspan...
I think you can probably pronounce it better than I, my English gets increasingly worse (<i>Applause</i>),
although I understand that we have no other choice but to confiscate it as a communication
instrument, since due to man's ambition, according to the Bible, we were condemned to wake
up one day each speaking a different language. We will have no other choice, also for
historical reasons, than to confiscate that language, without, of course, ever renouncing
each of our own languages. Such is life! They want only one language, the rest are a
nuisance that jeopardize trade. They have to make translations, and when they do it is
terrible.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They say that during Clinton's visit to
China, while they were saying that they were speaking to 1.2 billion Chinese, many Chinese
were irritated because they could not understand the American translators. They were so
conceited that when Clinton spoke in his debate and in his speech at the university, they
used translators <b>made in USA</b> (<i>Laughter</i>), and it happens that that is a
country where if you speak in the language of Beijing, they do not understand it in
Shanghai nor in Canton and other places. The written language is understood in the whole
country, but not the spoken language. Just imagine, an American translator translating
Clinton's speech into Pekinese and they do not seem to have done a good job! Then,
translation is a headache for them. It is better if everybody else speaks English and no
other language exists. It is a bother, for the movies, for TV serials, for everything. It
costs them more, they earn less. Perhaps Bill Gates is now even inventing a computer that
automatically translates from English into hundreds of other languages simultaneously.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As I was saying, they are shaping a world
of which they themselves are scared.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was saying when I tried to pronounce a
name, the name of the chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, how is it pronounced? (<i>From
the audience, they say Greenspan.</i>) That guy, he is intelligent, he cannot be
underestimated.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Greenspan has the same uncertainty, and the
fellow from the World Bank has the same uncertainty; Clinton has the same uncertainty and
does Rubin, the secretary of the Treasury and all the presidents of regional banks have
the same uncertainty, they are full of uncertainty. And many of the analyses - that those
who are very well informed convey to us, even what they discuss; because eight or ten
people discuss, they have friends that inform the press or other friends and even some of
the people concerned want it informed - always end with a phrase: &quot;No one knows what
is going to happen.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, they know that something is
bound to happen. They were happy a while back. When the first crisis, the Mexican crisis,
breaks out they start running all over the places to try to prevent it. They talk about
making 50,000 billion dollars available for Mexico. It is a close neighbor, with almost
100 million population. They are building there a wall one hundred times bigger than the
Berlin Wall, where more people die each year trying to cross, from thirst, accidents and
drowning, than those who died at the Berlin Wall for as long as it lasted. This wall is
3,000 kilometers long... Oh! so that people cannot pass. This is the philosophy of
neo-liberal globalization: free transit for capitals and goods but zero transit for
workers, zero transit for human beings.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Yes, let the doors be opened to human
beings. Some day the doors of the world will have to be opened. When feudalism is gone,
when we cease to be exploited serfs of the modern glebe, the roads of the world will have
to be opened.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I do not want to scare anybody with this, I
am just saying it: Why do they want only capitals and goods to cross and not human beings?
I am saying it to pose a moral dilemma. If our countries were developed and they had not
been colonies for so long and they had not been so exploited, this transit from one place
to another would not be necessary. Because, when you come to think of it, any such transit
involves an uprooting.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Nowadays, and for some time, the fear of a
massive Mexican migration due to a super crisis, encourages those of the North to find
solutions. We feel happy if the Mexicans do not suffer a super crisis. But their proximity
and all those other elements are pushing in that direction.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then the crises in Southeast Asia began.
Until then - what a great hypocrisy - the Asian tigers were <i>the</i> model. You could
find it in all the books, in all the literature: the Asian tigers, that grow steadily,
year after year, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years; it was the end of economic crises; it was
possible to grow indefinitely. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But, one day the tigers started losing
their claws, hair, skin, everything, and all of this overnight, while they were still the
model advised in universities, in economic conferences. They did not tell anyone what was
happening there, and they knew it, which is worse. Camdessus, chairman of the
International Monetary Fund, tries to justify it now: &quot;Yes, we knew it and we were
warning about it.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They knew that the money, the big loans,
were distributed among families, that they were distributed among the political clientele,
that they were invested in anything, without any concern. Money was pouring into those
countries, they invested it in real estate. Hong Kong was full of thousands and thousands
of buildings whose value increased. South Korea was full of conglomerates and all sorts of
industries in which anyone could invest with all the money they wanted. And the same thing
occurred in Thailand, in the Philippines, in Indonesia, and in all of those places.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The International Monetary Fund said: No,
we cannot say anything, because if we do we accelerate the crisis. And they keep silent,
until one day it becomes evident that the conditions of a high budget deficit, with high
deficits in the current account and overvalued currencies, were created. These were ideal
conditions for the speculation wolves, who have billions and billions of dollars and who,
like the wolves in the arctic forests, fall upon the reindeer lagging behind, they fall
upon any country with the proper conditions. Thus came the catastrophe.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then came the crisis of Japan, the model of
models, which developed by saving more than anybody. Because Japan received money from no
one. The Japanese save over 35% of their incomes. Americans nowadays save less than 10%.
The Americans&#146; specialty and privilege is in investing other people's money. The
Japanese invested their own money, they did not want American factories, nor American
banks, nor American insurance companies. The Americans kept demanding that they open up. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The crisis of Southeast Asia begins to
affect Japan. They manufacture many articles similar to those of other countries in the
region and the United States itself, and they begin to devalue the yen. The Americans
said: This is our chance, let's demand from the Japanese that they open up to investment
in banks, factories and in everything, to increase consumption. The more confusing things
appeared, the less the Japanese increased consumption. There came a moment when the yen
was quoted at 147 dollars and Washington ran into a panic, because beyond that, the danger
was very serious.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Before that, the crisis in Southeast Asia
strikes again. The Indonesian government collapses, there is a social explosion,
instability sets in creating a situation that is not very secure at the moment. A new
stage begins there. The situation in the other countries of Southeast Asia is increasingly
acute, the crisis makes a comeback. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At the same time, 11 nuclear tests in India
and Pakistan create, for the first time in the history of the nuclear age, the risk of a
regional nuclear war. That same month a deep crisis takes place in Russia. All of this in
one month. The truth is that Greenspan, Camdessus and Rubin could barely manage to run
from one place to another putting out economic and political fires; but above all, the
economic fires that threaten to bring about great political cataclysms. All of this takes
place in one month.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then, when the yen plummets to 147 to a
dollar, they, who did not want to do anything, prudently undertake intense discussions in
Washington. Because it is in Washington where orders are given not only to the US treasury
but also to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. They are simply orders.
The United States has the power of veto. They hold over 15% of the stocks, and with less
than 85% no agreement can be reached. Therefore, they had to make decisions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The United States government, advised by
all of those brains - because there is no doubt that it has advisors with great experience
who have managed great enterprises from the stock exchange, banks, finances, all of them
intelligent people, I concede that to the government advisors who want to perform miracles
- decides to spend some billion dollars buying yens. They rushed to buy yens to increase
the yen's value, and raised it to 136 per dollar. They knew that if it was further
devalued, it would bring about a catastrophe, because this would inevitably lead to the
devaluation of the Chinese yuan, which would add to the Southeast Asian catastrophe, and
then, to a greater devaluation of the yen.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They knew that the first immediate impact
would be felt by Brazil and then by Argentina, Mexico and Latin America. So, they waited
to see when the crisis would strike their own stockmarkets. It is a matter of great
importance. Horrified at what was going on in Russia, they said: No, this is too much.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At the moment, they have not solved any
problem, none of those problems. The crisis is increasingly more serious in Russia. Here,
in this university, I will say this which I have not had the opportunity to express at any
other place: the greatest catastrophe in history regarding the construction of a
socioeconomic regime is the attempt to build capitalism in Russia. It is the greatest
catastrophe that has ever happened in socioeconomic experimenting.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They criticize socialism. They speak about
the failure of socialism and try to build a new type of socioeconomic regime. But, if you
analyze the history of the countries that have attempted it, whatever their difficulties
before, you will find that even the USSR, that immense country with an 80% rural
population, they ended up being the first in outer space. They produced 630 million tons
of oil per year, 700 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year, with steel production
around 140 million tons, tens of millions of tons of fertilizer, around 200 million tons
of grains, despite being destroyed twice by war, and despite all of their mistakes. China
advanced, and other countries advanced, but they were blockaded. But, still conceding the
mistakes made in the economic construction of socialism - let alone the political mistakes
-, it had a hundred times better results than what they have achieved trying to build
capitalism in Russia.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Such disastrous results! Such an untenable
situation! A rich country, whose GDP is today 45% of what it was nine years ago, in spite
of the immense aid and all the credits it has been granted. I ask myself: What could Cuba
not accomplish with only a small part of Russia&#146;s oil? What could Cuba not accomplish
with only a small part of Russia&#146;s natural gas, its steel-production capacity, its
immense lumber forests in Siberia, its factories that manufacture the parts that our
tractors, trucks and equipment need today?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There has never been a similar failure in
history. They received the recipes of capitalism, and what is happening today? The Russian
population is decreasing, it decreases in about one million people a year. Infant
mortality in Russia must be around four or five times higher than in Cuba. Life expectancy
drops astonishingly. Fifty percent of the Gross Domestic Product is controlled by the
mafia. From 200 to 500 billion dollars have fled Russia. Much of it has been invested in
residences, in houses, 60,000 houses in Spain and countless houses in southern France, in
Austria, in Italy, in Cyprus, everywhere, from 200 to 500 billion. Only 50% of taxes are
collected. The national budget of what used to be a great power is now less than the
budget of Spain, for example.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Millions of people have not been paid their
wages for months. But, according to what has been published, the worst part of it is that
the strategic missiles operators in Central Siberia have not been paid for five months.
The situation is so serious that a recently elected governor of the region wrote to the
Prime Minister asking for jurisdiction over those nuclear missiles bases, since he might
provide them clothing and food to and meet the needs of those strategic missiles
operators.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Has anything similar to this ever occurred
in history? Has anything so potentially dangerous ever occurred like keeping unpaid those
operating the strategic nuclear missiles? This is it, the rest you can imagine. It is a
great risk, an indication of the danger of disintegration, really.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Can you imagine what the <i>Yugoslavization</i>
of a country that has more than 20,000 nuclear weapons might mean? These are real dangers.
And what have they been doing? They have been applying the recipes of the International
Monetary Fund and the neo-liberal policies to that country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Not long ago I met a representative of a
rich and powerful western country, and I said: What are you going to do about this? Are
you people crazy, are you so crazy that you will do nothing to avoid a catastrophe in that
country? Look what a real danger, as a result of a crisis, which is the result of the
implementation of neoliberal recipes, in an attempt to build capitalism in Russia.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This problem is a source of great concern
to all. We want this to be avoided one way or another. The disintegration of that country
would be a world catastrophe of unforeseeable consequences.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">First, it was a great multi-national State
they disintegrated with those same recipes. Let's have everybody invest mainly in the
Caspian sea oil - there go the American capitals - and in Russia's natural gas, anywhere.
But they have created a very difficult situation, a very serious situation which is part
of the ingredients contained in these problems.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It must be said that the crisis in
Southeast Asia by itself and the almost 100 billion dollars they had to spend in Korea, or
promise from different sources, plus the commitments in Indonesia, Thailand, the
Philippines, Malaysia, left the International Monetary Fund out of funds, desperately
asking the US Congress for an 18-billion-dollar contribution that the US Congress does not
want to approve. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now the Russians are desperately asking for
funds. What are 10 or 15 billion dollars for a bottomless barrel of needs? How can they be
urged to bring down their budgets? How long, then, will the millions of workers and
nuclear missiles operators remain unpaid? What will be left to pay for health care,
education, a minimum of utilities, public order. It is a budget that cannot be further
reduced a single cent, and to reduce it would invite an outburst. And 15 billion is no
money to that country. It is like a drop of water in the desert. A hundred billion are
required. Perhaps much more. If Korea needed 100 billion according to estimates, how much
would Russia need, whose population, although decreasing, is at least three and a half
times that of Korea.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Japanese economy does not take off
regardless what measures are taken. The Chinese yuan is being forcibly sustained as the
expression of China's will to cooperate in some way to avoid the international
catastrophe. But not devaluating the yuan is already costing China tens of millions of
dollars. How much longer will the Chinese economy be able to stand that? Particularly when
it is accompanied by other phenomena like unusual floods resulting from climatic changes
and from the deforestation and erosion brought about by the need to produce food. If the
Chinese were forced to devalue the yuan, the economy of Southeast Asia would be more
seriously affected in the third or fourth comeback of the crisis. The yen would inevitably
plunge further and the wave would spread through the rest of the Third World.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Nobody's money is safe in any of those
countries, you should know that. If the depositors' money is in the national currency and
they sense that a devaluation is coming, it happens like in Moscow: endless queues of
people at the bank changing rubles for dollars. But, they do not have a lot of dollars
there so they have to stop and declare a payments default that is considered a disaster
within that scheme.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The other countries with a free exchange,
the established design they have imposed on the world, have no way of protecting their
reserves. It is absolutely forbidden by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
to set exchange controls. That is the worst sin described in the theology of
neo-liberalism. At the slightest risk everybody runs to the banks to take away what little
hard currency the country has left.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">And what happens with the hard currency
that they take away when there is a crisis? They invest it in US bonds, or European bonds.
Thus, hundreds of billions that have fled have ended up in those places because money
seeks security.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then, due also to historical factors, the
only refuge they have left is the U.S. Treasury bonds. I say for historical reasons
because after the Civil War that ended around 1864 - if my memory does not fail me - in
the days when you were again establishing your independence over here, the United States
took part in World War I some decades later. It possessed enormous natural, mineral, oil
and agricultural resources. It participated in that war toward the end of it, it did not
lose a single factory, it collected a lot of money and ended up with a powerful economy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then comes the World War II. The United
States entered the war at a moment when Roosevelt's policy gained ground against an
isolationist policy. Roosevelt was undoubtedly a great capitalist statesman. At a time of
serious recession he began lifting the economy, fought the isolationist trend and set out
in the struggle against fascism. It is a historic merit. But in that war, the already
powerful US industry did not lose a single screw, either. They collected all the gold in
the world: the gold of Europe, the gold of England, the gold of almost everybody on the
whole planet. The war over, its intact industry quickly crossed over to civil production
without any competition. The rest of the world was in ruins. It was then that the United
Nations emerged, the Security Council with its five countries with a veto power and the
Bretton Woods Treaty. That treaty gave the United States an exceptional privilege.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Yesterday, in Bani, I explained that we
would donate to a school an award that we had been granted. But, I said, we have to
prevent it from being devalued and someone from the audience cried: &quot;Change it for
gold&quot;. I remembered Bretton Woods right away. Gold, I said, is also devalued now. It
is in the same situation with copper, aluminum, nickel, because all those crises are
already influencing the commodity prices. Again the prices of copper, nickel, aluminum,
all those products are depressed - some of them very depressed - and a global crisis still
has not set in.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The fact is that in Bretton Woods they had
all the gold accumulated and the gold standard was adopted. That institution worked on the
basis of the gold standard. For every US dollar that was issued, there had to be a
definite amount of gold in the treasury reserves. If you had 35 dollars you had the right
to claim an ounce of gold, which was then maintained at 35 dollars, the troy ounce, as the
bankers call it. Money had a gold backing and its price was stable. If the supply
increased, the Americans bought enough to maintain it, understand? Well, that was done to
prevent the price of gold from dropping below 35 dollars. When there was the threat of a
price increase, they began selling gold from their reserve to keep it at 35. Since after
the war when that institution was created, until 1971, the American dollar was convertible
into gold.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But many things happened during that
period. The Vietnam war cost 500 billion dollars without taxes. Wars, which are not
popular, are less so if they come with taxes. Pearl Harbor, a big attack that filled the
whole population with indignation, was one thing but a war 10,000 miles away, on the other
side of the world, begun and carried out in an irresponsible way, was different. It cost
500 billion.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The United States gold reserve began to
dwindle. When there were approximately 10 billion left, they implemented the great
swindle: they suspended the dollar's convertibility into gold, unilaterally and consulting
no one. After that the American bill was nothing but a piece of paper, faith its only
support, and the fact that there was no other currency. De Gaulle always opposed that,
because he realized the privileges that gave the United States. The right to issue money
without any gold support.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then Reagan comes along and carries forward
the United States military build-up, including the Stars War program which was just
beginning. The United States public debt when Reagan assumed office: 700 billion. Eight
years later, at the end of Reagan&#146;s term, the U.S. public debt was more than 2
trillion dollars. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How did they solve their budget deficits?
Sometimes these were in the order of 150 or 200 billion dollars. They sold treasury bonds
at a certain interest. Those who bought the bonds kept them in the reserve or in safe
banks. Since the dollar was the only currency, although at a point in time it faced some
competition from the Dutch mark, the Japanese yen and a few others, when these had
difficulties, again, it was left as the only reserve currency and the treasury bonds as
the safest securities.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The countries exported goods and collected
dollars. But, they did not spend the dollars in US goods or services, they deposited those
in their reserves. Because every country needs reserves as every central bank does too.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Most of the world reserves of all central
banks and of many commercial banks are in American bills, values that did not cost more
than the paper and the ink to print them. The result is that the United States is the
owner of the world currency. So, if there is the need to buy yens, it buys yens. It prints
the money. An important part of that money is not spent, it is put away. If you are given
a million dollars in exchange for goods and the right to buy from the person who gave it
to you all that he can sell, but you take the million dollars, keep it in your house and
do not spend it, then it does not cost the person who gave it to you a single penny.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then the United States enjoys a privileged
position today, a very privileged position, which no other country in the world enjoys. In
times of panic, the first thing that all those who have money in the currency of any
country do, whether they are in Mexico, Brazil, anywhere in fear of a devaluation, is to
change it into dollars and deposit it mainly in American banks. It is one of the things
they do, according to the interest rates in the banks. If the interest is too low, they
might invest it in bonds or other securities.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now comes the other problem. When the stock
values in the stockmarket drops or people perceive they might drop - and this is where the
greatest danger lies -, all of those whose money is invested in the stock exchange, if
they get scared, they quickly sell those stocks and they do not necessarily invest it in
other stocks considered less risky. They generally invest in United States treasure bonds.
In other words, they put away their money in the form of bonds to try to guarantee its
value.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So, under certain circumstances, they do
one of two things: they either have stocks or they have national currency. They change the
national currency into dollars because they know it is going to be devalued. The central
banks spend up to their last penny in hard currency and that money is transferred to the
American banks or used to buy stocks in the stockmarkets of that or another country if
there is no fear of investing there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When the stock values start to drop, they
do exactly the same thing. They sell them, they collect them and as the stocks are unsafe,
they resort to the safest of all the securities, until now, historically, the treasury
bonds. That is how they are defending themselves and all the maneuvers to prevent a
depression.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The real problem will come when the
inevitable happens: a global crisis, as global as the global things they are doing.
Because, there is no longer an isolated phenomenon in a country's economy that does not
have an impact on the rest.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Asian crises are already causing the
American exports to decrease in the United States now because everybody goes to buy the
goods in Southeast Asia or in Japan where they can buy a lot cheaper. That is an immediate
result, and they fear that that might affect their excellent situation with employment
right now. In other words, they too are suffering the consequences.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The fear lies in what might occur in the
event of a global financial crisis affecting all of those countries and a situation of
panic, because all that edifice I have tried to describe is supported by a pillar known as
trust, something a bit more unstable than love (<i>Laughter</i>). Because love might last
a long time, even a whole lifetime, but not trust, trust is ephemeral and depends on many
factors. There is an antidote for that thing called trust and that antidote is panic. All
you need is panic and the whole edifice collapses. That is why the bosses of the world
economy are going to such great length to avoid panic.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When there is news that such and such
stockmarket fell so many points in Hong Kong, here or there, the IMF immediately comes out
with: &quot;No, no, no, everything is fine, great, excellent.&quot; Clinton immediately
begins working the phone: &quot;Everything is great. Our unemployment rate is the lowest
we have had in such and such a time, our economy is growing at such and such a rate,
inflation is at its lowest, there is no fear, there is security, everything is going
excellently.&quot; </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That is what you call a sedative - librium,
I think is the name of that tranquilizer people take when they are nervous, there are many
different brands -, calm down to avoid panic. Then Rubin, from the Treasury, comes out and
says: &quot;Everything is absolutely fine, in so many years we have not had such a high
level of employment, nor has the economy grown as it is growing, nor are our potentials so
splendid.&quot; The World Bank comes out and repeats the same thing. They have repeated it
so much these days that it sounds like a scratched record. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Federal Reserve says the same thing to
calm everybody. Because, all you need is panic and the same thing that happened in 1929
may happen again. Everybody rushing off to sell their stocks and there is no stopping
them. That is the moment of doom.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All that the theoreticians and experts of
developed capitalism, the followers of this model and this economic order, have done is
try to devise ways so that a depression such as the 1929 does not take place. In this case
it would be more serious and global, really global, as global as the world they are
designing, and it is all based on something so vulnerable and fragile as trust.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This without mentioning other factors that
are influencing, and will continue to influence, the economy. Billions, hundreds of
billions have been invested in many countries of Southeast Asia and elsewhere to produce
the same things: refrigerators, TV sets, radios, computer chips. All of them producing the
same thing. They are creating an enormous production capacity.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Large investments are made in China, and
there are 1.2 billion Chinese. It can prove very difficult to surpass that country in
manufacturing goods, and they are already producing them and with good quality.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Let us see what happens when the
neo-liberal theories, with the enthusiastic effort of the WTO, do away with all the
customs barriers. There will not even be the possibility of manufacturing jeans to sell in
the United States, Canada and other places. The African might very well need jeans but
they do not have a penny to buy it with; neither do the Indians, who are 900 million
people; nor the people of Bangladesh, who are many millions; nor the hundreds of millions
of poor people in Latin America. That is a trick, a consolation. They say, manufacture
some garments and the countries are in such a difficult situation that they have no other
choice but to find some hope in manufacturing at least those products: shoes, jeans.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Once, chatting with the prime minister of
Canada, who was telling me about their billion dollar trade with the United States, and
their relations with Latin America and other countries - Mexico, among them -, really
interested in developing relations with Latin America, I told him: &quot;Do you export to
the United States shoes and all of those things that are produced with cheap labor?&quot;
He answered: &quot;No, we export state-of-the-art technology products obtained with
intensive capital investment.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, they even sell water, electricity,
natural gas, oil, some of these products. I asked him then if the Mexicans could export
the same thing to the United States and Canada? The Mexicans, with their assembly plants,
export items produced at very low cost with salaries which are one tenth of the salary of
an American worker. Even the Americans oppose such an agreement for fear that the
factories are taken away to set them up beyond the US borders.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I ask, then if we destined to export jeans,
shoes and items requiring only cheap labor? When I start adding up all the Chinese who can
produce that and other things, and all the Indians, and all the Bangladeshis and all the
Indonesians, and all the Latin Americans, and all the Haitians and people from all over, I
cannot find the customers anywhere. These are nothing but tricks.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They say: &quot;Meanwhile, remove the
tariff barriers and let foreign capital pour in.&quot; Very well, but the foreign capitals
know we need them, like thirsty men lost in the desert, and they increasingly demand the
lion's share in order to invest, presently not only free-trade zones that establish
industries, provide jobs.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, in a country with unemployment
problems and all sorts of needs, it is better to have a man working, even if it is for a
modest salary. These countries have no other alternative. It would be more just to receive
a transfer of technology and a transfer of capital through soft loans on lenient terms, to
be repaid in 20, 25, or 30 years, to set up a private or state owned national industry.
But, I will not go into that topic.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Recently, in the Caribbean I met with a
group of businessmen who manufacture different types of goods, in small factories, and who
are logically seeking to expand their markets. They expressed certain commercial
interests. I told them: &quot;When some of those products you are making are manufactured
massively in certain countries, what are your possibilities to compete?&quot; They really
had to admit that they did not stand a chance.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The fact is that this world order I am
talking about affects every country, especially the Third World countries, not Europe,
which is quickly uniting in order to have a currency that can compete with the dollar and
a market of 400 million customers. It does not hurt us, anyway. From our point of view, to
avoid the existence of one single economic power, it is preferable to have two or three.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today everything depends on one currency,
that of the United States. Privilege distributed among three or four is better than
privilege in one single hand, because it then gains uncontrollable power. Let that power
be distributed, at least in the economic sector, in the military sector it is unthinkable,
let it be distributed among different poles.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Europeans are quickly uniting beyond
borders. They really have human transit over there. In united Europe, there is transit of
capital, transit of goods and transit of people, they have no walls. To defend from the
colossus, to defend themselves from the consequences, to have a place in this
globalization, they have to unite even though they spent centuries warring against one
another and they speak many different languages.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Our countries are the ones without any
security, there is nothing there for us. We put this forward in the World Trade
Organization, because we see the straight jacket they want to impose on us. Patents rights
for a 50 years term, that is just great! The United States has taken the best talents from
all parts of the world and also has the best research centers and all the necessary
resources. Now they want to charge patent rights, like the gabelle in the low of the
Middle Ages, for any product coming out of their research centers, no matter how badly
needed those products are.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The day must come when intelligence is
rewarded. The day must come when works like the <i>Iliad</i>, the <i>Odyssey</i>, <i>Don
Quixote, </i>Shakespeare and all the others, become universal property. The day must come
when there are other ways to reward talent, to stimulate it, to further it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Right now, if there are two Central
American transnational companies that are jealous of the bananas exported by the small
Caribbean islands, subjected to droughts, hurricanes, two phenomena that are enemies of
bananas, and if they are paid a preferential price in Europe, despite the fact that those
island only partake of 1% of the banana trade, the interests of two American companies
prevail over the interests of the islands, some of which live exclusively from the banana
trade. The WTO rules in favor of the United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now they are cooking up the Multilateral
Agreement on Investments in the OECD, a club of the rich, so that the others subscribe it
and they can impose on all the countries whatever they agree there. In other words, we
already have the IMF, but the WTO is gradually becoming another risky instrument of the
appalling new order, because there is not enough awareness among our own allegedly
developing countries which are the vast majority there.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We need to make the political leaders see
the consequences of all of this. Sweep away the custom tariffs, they say. And what are we
going to export? Who are we going to compete with? If there are no custom revenues, and
besides there are no taxes, and there are no taxes because the investors are in a
free-trade zone or because they demand from the country receiving the investment more and
more years of tax exemption even when they are not in a free trade zone.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I asked the Grenadians how many years of
tax exemption they grant to those who are building hotels there. Hotels, too, are a source
of jobs for them. They originate other economic activities, give life to the island. It is
better than having nothing, since they have no other alternative. Their answer: They have
ten years of tax exemption.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We ourselves have to grant tax exemptions,
although not that long. Sometimes, while the investment is recovered. As a rule, it takes
five, six or even seven years. We have to do it, because we need that capital, although we
dedicate part of the country's resources to build hotels which are the nation's property.
Sometimes we let foreign companies manage them for us. They have the expertise and the
markets. We then tell them to manage them for a given percentage.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are told about Sweden and the social
conditions there which are now also declining, just like development aid but, if I
remember well, the enterprises contribute with up to 60% of their net profits to make
possible the social programs, social welfare, social development of countries. We are
threatened with being left without taxes and incomes from custom tariffs. How are we going
to meet our needs in education, health care, housing, drinking water, social development,
development, employment? They leave us nothing. That new order simply wants to impose on
us the condition of universal wage earners, and it cannot guarantee even that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If they had been able to conceive something
that under their philosophical conception is impossible, that is, a model that would give
employment to the 6 billion inhabitants of the planet, I mean employment for the active
labor force of a community that already reaches 6 billion, you might say: Well they are
promising something. They have not conceived it and they cannot conceive it, because their
irrational system makes it impossible.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Oftentimes the working hours cannot be
reduced, as the French want to do, because then they compete with the other countries
which have not reduced the working hours. And that is absurd in a humanity that has
created machines that can reduce physical work from 60 hours in the last century to 20
hours per week; sometimes they were more, 70 and 80 hours even. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It may be said today that, with the
existing technology the production of all of those things that are going to be in excess
and are not going to have any market might serve to meet the real demands, the real needs
of the world population working 20 hours a week. The rest of the time they could use for
culture, recreation, studying and a thousand ways that human beings can spend their time.
There need not be unemployment.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Cuba is an example. It has more than 60,000
doctors and none of them are unemployed, because they not only work in hospitals and
polyclinics, there is a doctor in every ship, every work center, every day-care center,
every school, every community. There are almost 30,000 community doctors in the urban
areas and the mountains. Of course, we cannot pay them a very high salary for, where are
we going to get it from now? But that person is doing a useful job for society. That
person is not a useless, unemployed illiterate, but a professional who gains more and more
knowledge daily, who saves lives and promotes health. If there are too many of them, they
can be sent to the universities to receive courses like the teachers do, to upgrade
themselves during their sabbatical, by studying, and have other doctors substitute them.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have 63,000 doctors and around 2,000
medical students still enroll in the university every year. A doctor is a professional who
never wants to retire, the older he is the more experienced he considers himself. We have
21 medical faculties and we are cooperating with some countries in the training of
doctors.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">And who do we have studying at the
universities now? The nurses. They must graduate from the university. Also health
technicians must be university graduates. In other words, we use those capacities to raise
our quality standards. Why should there be a surplus of people if they can be trained and
used in a rational manner?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Do not let them come around telling us that
the market, that wild and crazy beast, that cannot be called any other way, is going to
organize human society, nor that the law of supply and demand can be above the
organizational capacity of human beings or above the million and trillion neurons in the
human brain. The market is a chaotic and uncontrollable wild beast (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Let me tell you that I am saying this at a
time when the market is fashionable everywhere. They are even talking about a socialist
market economy. They will have to describe well the meaning of a socialist market economy.
Well, if they say that it is a necessary type of distribution, a mechanism for that, we
listen but it cannot be the market that plans and determines humanity's future, the market
preserving the environment, the market preserving nature and life.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Who are they going to make believe that
story about the market watching over the purity of the air, the good quality of the
waters, fruitful seas where the fish necessary for the growing number of inhabitants of
this planet can grow, to prevent what occurred when the market filled them with fishing
fleets and trawlers that have diminished their ability to produce food, apart from the
pollution of that food with mercury and other chemicals harmful to human health that have
been dumped into the sea? The Mediterranean alone receives waste from 140,000 European
factories.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The time will come when it will not be
possible to eat even a sardine without having a jar of antihistamines and antitoxins by
one's side, because they are really increasingly poisonous.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">And what is that? That is the market. What
has destroyed nature? That system has. What has provoked the warming of the atmosphere,
the possibility of the polar icecaps melting, the increase of floods on the one hand and
of hurricanes on the other, even if dozens of islands and parts of the coastal areas will
be under water when the sea level rises? What good will all our docks, ports and current
maritime facilities, including recreation centers, do us then? These are real dangers not
fantasy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They have lately fell in the habit of
referring to people who make this sort of criticism as catastrophists. Since my name is
Castro, it is all the same if they call me catastrophist or whatever they like (<i>Applause</i>).
I know that my rational, mathematical and physical calculations are accurate. Besides,
they are the real catastrophists because they are the ones who cause the catastrophe. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In any event, we are warning them not to
cause it, and telling them that we are hopeful that the world can survive, that the human
specie has advanced so much in technological, scientific and intellectual development, as
well as in the means to support man's intelligence and strength, as to find solutions not
even dreamed of before, to produce food and goods for the human population, to preserve
nature, which is a decisive issue, and preserve it soon.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Millions of tons of chlorofluorocarbon
advancing toward the ozone layer, more and more millions of carbon dioxide, millions,
hundreds of million, billions of tons of this gas go to the atmosphere every year.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When they meet for discussion, the United
States is last to accept the slightest reduction or the slightest commitment. They have
created the market of the air pollution quotas, I can not call it otherwise. If a country
has a quota of pollution to send up into the atmosphere and saves it, it can sell it to
another so the other one can send it. That is a very humane, very rational, very
understanding market. It is really incredible! It is not worthy of a civilized society, of
a developed humanity!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is about these matters - and I know you
have been too kind already (<i>Applause</i>) - that I invite you to think.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Another terrible problem that we are
suffering - perhaps the last one I will touch upon - is that of the aggression to our
national identities, the ruthless aggression to our cultures, as never before in history,
the trend towards a universal monoculture. How can anyone conceive such world? It is not a
world order that combines the wealth and culture of many countries, but a world order
that, by definition, destroys culture, a globalization that inevitably destroys culture.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What is one's homeland, if not one's own
culture? What is national identity if not the country's own culture? Can there be a
greater spiritual wealth than one's own culture, created during eons by mankind? Can our
customs be simply swept away, ruthlessly swept away? We have to be aware of that, because
the battles of ideas and concepts will be a great battle.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If we are to speak about ideology, let us
speak about the ideology of saving the world; not later, but as soon as possible. Let's
try to save it and improve it as of now. After we have saved it, we will be able to
improve it even more.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was saying that this battle for survival
is not a class struggle, even though the classes may be involved in the conflict. This
battle for the survival of the Third World countries include us all: those who have large
resources and those who have very little.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I think that both, the rich and the poor,
if they are sailing on the same ship, would not want the ship to sink. There might be a
minimum of collaboration to try to save the ship. We are really sailing in a <i>Titanic</i>
with a lot of sea beneath and many icebergs in the way. That dramatic story, has now
served to invest 300 million dollars in a movie with more than a billion dollars in
profits. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The great films are no longer simply films,
but a combination of film and commercial operation, and when they have drawn hundreds of
millions from the film, they have obtained thousands of millions from the products
connected with the picture that are sold, from lion kings, dolls, toys and myriads of
objects that absorb the families' money. It is all a combination, the merging of
commercial and recreation enterprises whose objectives have nothing to do with culture.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A question: Who are the only ones in the
world who have 300 million dollars for a film? There is only one answer: the growing,
uncontrollable monopolies of the mass media in the hands of the American transnationals.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Suffice it to cite a few examples, if you
allow me I will recall some facts: 50% of all the films made and shown in the world today
belong to American companies, 75% to 80% of the TV serials, 70% of videos, 50% of
satellites through which any place can be reached, 60% of the world's networks and 75% of
Internet. All of this is in their hands, and all of this is at the service of the
neo-liberal globalization concepts and the ideas it is putting forward. These are very
powerful sources of ideology, information, beliefs, customs that can transform many
things.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In the Spanish speaking America, an average
of 245 films are premiered per country yearly, of which 70% are American, 10% correspond
to the local film industry, 14% are European and only 3% are Spanish American.
Seventy-nine percent of the TV programs imported by the Spanish America come from the
United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Actually, I was amazed when I read not long
ago that hamburgers were already in India. The Indians, whose culture is so special, who
do not even eat beef, already have the Mc Donald produced with buffalo meat. Well, you
have had it for a long time now (<i>Laughter</i>). They are here, they are everywhere, but
I am talking of India. I can imagine those who are capable of mixing even the meat of a
dead oxen killed by accident on a highway with the buffalo meat. Well, the Indians with Mc
Donald, and chains of Mc Donald stores, that is the culture of globalization that is
imposed. The Indians have other consumption habits, and they have a lot better and more
refined dishes than hamburgers.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Chinese consuming Mc Donald, the
Africans consuming Mc Donald, wherever there is the possibility for that product. The
Chinese consuming Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. The Latin Americans have had the habit for a
long time now, but the Chinese did not have it, they drank tea and other things. The
Chinese and the Indians are consuming Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. The Europeans are also
learning very quick to consume hot dogs and hamburgers. They gradually acquire the Western
customs and habits, they even smoke the cigarettes targeted for critical campaigns in the
United States to reduce death by cancer but which are advertised and exported to the whole
world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The culture of reading, which was a
privilege of our ancestors, when over 80% of the population was illiterate which is
amazing, is considerably losing ground. Reading habits? No. TV serials? Serials, yes, one
after the other, unstoppable superficiality of all sorts, escapism.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How much time do children have for
studying? The average TV time of children with electricity in their homes is three hours
of their after-school time. The reading habit is gradually disappearing.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Books? What books are available to the
Third World? In Finland, for example where they have a lot of paper and big forests they
now prefer to exploit the least bit possible, they buy trees from the Russians, they
preserve theirs and go to Siberia. The number of books published in Finland between 1991
and 1994 was 246 per 100,000 people, while in India and Madagascar it was barely one per
100,000. The average number of books published in the developed countries is 54 per
100,000 people, while in the countries still to develop it is 7 books. That is their
possibility of reading, of knowing at least the history of the country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is very sad to hear - and it is true -
that if a survey is made among Latin American children, if you ask many Mexican children
who were Hidalgo and Morelos, or if you ask Central American children who was Morazán, or
in Latin America who was Bolivar, they don not know who Bolivar was, and yet, a great
majority of those children know who Mickey Mouse is. That is their cultural legacy to us,
they are destroying the most cherished values of our lives, our peoples, our nations, our
communities.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Three transnational news agencies
circulated 80% of the news disseminated in the world by cables. And that is nothing
compared to digital television, the increasing number of channels, fiber optics and the
possibilities that keep emerging.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Something as sacred as culture is
threatened with extinction, because those media are mainly used for commercial and not for
educational purposes. Very few Africans have a TV channel, a radio station, and when they
do have a TV channel, then all that is shown comes from abroad, comes from the developed,
consumers societies, comes particularly from the United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Are they going to leave us any freedom?
They are not even going to leave us the freedom of choosing our food, nor cooking it as
our ancestors historically did. All at the service of that unsustainable order.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I expressed that idea clearly: What will
happen when the inevitable depression comes as it will in a global fashion? Nothing has
been devised, nor can anything be devised to prevent it in a world increasingly governed
by the market laws. But this time it will be different! It will not be like in 1929. The
stocks are more inflated, a lot more inflated than in 1929, five times, six times
inflated, the stocks in the United States. Something which has nothing to do with the
creation of new riches, but with what I referred to as trust, the hope that they will
continue gaining value: earning money by betting, buying stocks, buying currencies,
anything. People invest their money based on that hope.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I already explained in the CARICOM meeting
that currently, everyday, every 24 hours, speculative operations are carried out for 1.5
trillion dollars. This figure equals eighteen times - I used a smaller figure in the
Caribbean meeting, I always prefer to use a lower figure, I said: around 15 times - the
GDP of the whole world in 15 days. In the calculations I made, it came to around 17 or 18
days. This amount is bet in the world everyday. There has never been anything like this.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As I explained, it is money going for
money; not money invested in a factory, in an enterprise, in industry or services, but
money invested in bonds, currencies, in stocks, anything, even coffee; but not in real
coffee, rather coffee quoted in the stockmarkets, which is quoted at two dollars and a
buyer thinks that it is going to go up to 2.30, so he buys it to sell it later when it is
at 2.30. He has not produced a single coffee bean, he has not grown it; but he invented a
game, a lottery with coffee, with sugar and with any other product, and, above all, with
stocks.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Before, it was only the rich, the
millionaires, the Rockefellers who had stocks in the stockmarkets. Today, in the United
States, tens and tens of millions of people have their savings invested in stocks, and the
insurance mutual funds are invested in stocks.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A crisis like that of 1929 would be a huge
catastrophe. Let us ask Greenspan, Rubin, Camdessus and the director of the World Bank if
they think that speculative balloon can be sustained. Exactly the same thing in 1929. We
must tell them: Gentlemen, you have created a World Bank that keeps running around, a
monetary fund that has no funds, or not enough, and the crises spread. Are you sure that
balloon is not going to deflate?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At the WTO, at the end of their different
agendas, I proposed an issue. I humorously proposed to add an issue: Global economic
crisis, what can be done? That is what I want to ask those gentlemen, what can be done?
Have they invented the philosopher's stone? What have they invented so that these
phenomena don not bring about the feared depression?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I personally do not have the slightest
doubt. It does not seem like we will have to wait long, bearing in mind some of the things
we have listed here and many more. Events are happening very fast. These are times in
which events follow one another at great speed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This is a very new problem. The concepts of
globalization are very recent. They have developed with a great force in the last 15 or 20
years, but mainly in the last 10 years. Environmental awareness is also new. Thirty or
thirty-five years ago, very few people spoke about the environment; today everybody talks
about it and there is awareness. Events are moving very fast.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I ask myself if this is the last or next to
last crisis. We are very interested in, and try to inform ourselves as much as possible
about, how events might unfold this year and the next. What will happen in Russia, Japan
and Southeast Asia? If the crisis reaches the other regions how will they solve the
problem, plus the pressing political issues, which are very serious. A very serious
political problem can be an outburst in Russia, which is not the same as an outburst in
Yugoslavia or in the Kosovo province, it would be a political catastrophe.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All this means that we are facing the risk
of problems that are called to affect the whole world, because the crisis that is already
here is affecting many countries. Sugar producers see the price of sugar at eight cents.
Those who produce copper see the price cut in half and the same occurs with nickel,
aluminum, rubber. Everybody is seeing the prices of their commodities cut almost in half
right now.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The economy of every country is exposed to
Stock Exchange moves and speculation and to losing in a moment of panic all the monetary
reserves of a country's central bank, any country. We are not included, because since we
were thrown out of all those agencies, we do not have to abide by any IMF recipe or
anybody else's (<i>Laughter and applause</i>). The others have to comply with them, and
they are liable to wake up one day without a penny in their reserves.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">These are very tough problems. The climatic
changes. The great influence that can have on the food prices or the people purchasing
power. But this should be no reason for us to do like the IMF, the World Bank, the Federal
Reserve Bank and the US Treasury and say: Be calm, be calm, everything is doing very well.
This is a passing phenomenon.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Some of you have young nephews and nieces,
or children, or grandchildren five, six or seven years old. In 50 years they will be a lot
younger than what I am now, a lot younger. After 50 years have passes they do so quickly -
and I certainly know it, I sometimes think I am still in school, or it seems only like
yesterday. How quickly have 50 years gone by for me! The Cubans who have lived through
almost 40 years of revolution and blockade, we know. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Forty years can go to quickly! Sometimes it
seems like a second but, when those 50 years have passed, the population of this planet
will be 10 billion. That will determine the need for more rice, more hamburgers, more
wheat, more corn, more milk, more clothes and shoes, more medicines, more housing, more
transportation, more drinking water, more recreation, more culture, more spiritual goods
that can be produced in infinite quantities, or rather that a rational humanity might
produce, not a few thousand transnationals guided by the market laws.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is so much spiritual wealth that
humanity might create! And man does not live on bread alone, as the Bible says. Spiritual
goods or riches, spiritual values are missed a lot more when material needs are satisfied,
and for those 4 billion additional population, humanity will have to train doctors,
teachers, build hospitals, develop new medicines, which should also prolong life, and
defeat cancer, AIDS and other new and old diseases.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The number of those who will have to be fed
and aided by a smaller percentage of the people will grow every year. That is why in the
United States, England and other places they are beginning to worry and want to raise the
retirement age to 65 or more. The life of human beings will be prolonged, it can be
prolonged. New medicines and the WHO programs have cut in half the number of children who
died 30 or 40 years ago. Productivity must grow. Humanity must be fed!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Does that humanity exist or not? Must it
not be fed, educated and given the maximum well-being which does not only lie with
material goods? There comes a time when material goods are more than enough. Right now,
there are those who have three or four more automobiles than they need. The consumption
patterns would also need to be analyzed. All those food chains I talked about, all those
media monopolies are wholly devoted to advertising the consumption habits of the developed
capitalist societies. It is awful.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">How can we imagine every Chinese and every
Indian with an automobile at the doorstep! What would be left of the 10 million hectares
that the Chinese have today to produce grains, rice, food for 1.5 billion people that they
will be in a few decades and at the same time build roads, highways, garages, houses?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Can they continue spreading in the world
and imposing a desire for those consumption patterns? Could we not instill a greater
desire for culture and spiritual wealth? When humans discover it, oftentimes they prefer
that rather than any other thing (<i>Applause</i>). Things for edification not alienation,
and television not only for recreation but for education, training, nurturing man's
spirit, making him better, more generous, not for turning him into a wild animal, into a
killer.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Other statistical data show that in many
countries there is an average of 5 to 10 acts of aggression per hour of television, and
that in the period 1996-97 the programs showing violence were 61% of the total. Violence
and more violence, sex and more sex, which differs from reality, for man is not violent by
nature, even if the Bible tells us that Cain killed Abel, although television did not
exist then (<i>Laughter</i>). </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As for sex, man needs to be educated,
because it is instinctively, naturally awaken, there is no need to go around proclaiming
it either, isn't that right, young university students? (<i>Laughter.</i>) It is exploited
and exacerbated for grossly commercial purposes. This also brings about many phenomena of
our society, linked to today&#146;s world such as: irresponsibility, emotional
instability, disappointments, separations, divorces.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Believe me, this is not a priest speaking
from his pulpit (<i>Laughter</i>). I am not and cannot be against the right to divorce,
but as leaders of a country, we wish that there were more stability in the family, so the
less divorces the better.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is because stability really helps the
children who are the ones most affected and it helps man, for instance, to control his
instincts. Nothing is gained by exacerbating them.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Violence and sex are two things much
resorted to by these media with a commercial orientation. Everything turns out to be
commercial. There is nothing human, nothing that seeks human betterment, but anything that
can bring profit even if it destroys mankind, even if it makes social life more
complicated.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We must nurture values. There is no
alternative, if within a maximum of freedom, because authentic values are those practiced
in the greatest freedom (<i>Applause</i>).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is neither a dream nor something
impossible that all those fabulous resources that could serve to educate, train and
improve mankind, can one day be used for these humane purposes.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I say that time goes by very quickly, not
only the time I have used up on this rostrum (<i>Laughter</i>), but the other - and I say
it because I am afraid I might miss the plane (<i>Laughter</i>) -, time flies! I said 50
years. You already have an idea that, no matter how many we are, there will be less space.
Let us ask ourselves what should be our life patterns, our consumption patterns; what
patterns befit us, as an immense, growing humanity.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I think these problems are a source of
concern to many people today, one way or another, regardless of social classes or
religious beliefs. The great challenge is how to bring all the talents, all the values and
all the ethical systems in conjunction to achieve those objectives.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have taken up a few hours of your time,
but I did not want to come here to simply say: &quot;Good afternoon. How are you all? We
are very happy for the way you have welcome us!&quot; (<i>Applause.</i>) Of course, all
this is true, but I do not have to say what you know so well.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I wanted to share some of our ideas, our
thoughts. I was not planning to speak too much about Cuba. I was a bit lengthy on that
topic to explain some of our experiences. I wanted, rather, to address these issues here,
brother to brother, heart to heart, with a frankness equal to the hospitality, the
generosity and the affection you have shown our delegation. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You, who have so much contributed to the
success of this visit in every respect, you who have been so brotherly, you who have
upheld our souls with so much spirit, so much enthusiasm and so much encouragement.
Because that trust has not been forged under a clear sky, it has been forged under a
deluge of lies, misinformation, slanders; it has been forged under a storm of lightening
bolts during these years that we have not even had the opportunity of seeing each other
this way, of meeting people to people, in representation, along with other comrades, of
the Cuban people. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Let us rejoice for this great progress, let
us rejoice that our peoples can come closer, exchange, talk. But your courage is great - I
was saying - because your trust has developed under almost impossible conditions. What
does this teach us? That one must have confidence in man, one must have confidence in the
peoples, their talent, their intelligence.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If in many parts of the world the
representatives of that blockaded Cuba, slandered through the most sophisticated media,
have friends and find so many ordinary men and women who understand their struggle, who
understand their cause and express their solidarity with it, is it not that perhaps a lot
more difficult than to dream of a better future, of a more just world and of a global,
universal society which is truly humane? (<i>Applause.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What I have described, born from the
experience of our fighting, militant people, from the experiences we have lived through in
matters of this kind, from sleepless eyes that try to see and guess the evolution of
events, are my convictions, and the convictions of our comrades. We want to leave them
here for you, Dominican brothers and sisters, as curators of these ideas which I do not
ask you to agree with, but I do ask you to think about. We ourselves have to delve deeper
and learn a lot more.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You have listened with patience and
respect. I thank you and once again express my admiration, because in this meeting with
you, and I know very well who I am meeting with, I can once again appreciate how many
deep-thinking men and women and how many noble men and women we have had the privilege of
seeing and meeting on this trip.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I will say it now: I am leaving your
country a happy man. We will all try, and all Cubans will try, to be worthy of that
solidarity, that trust and that extraordinary love you have shown us.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thank you very much (<i>Applause and
exclamations of: &quot;Fidel, Fidel, Fidel!&quot;</i>). (<i>Ovation.</i>)</font></p>
