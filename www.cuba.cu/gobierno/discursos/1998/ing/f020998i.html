FIDEL CASTRO TO THE 12th SUMMIT OF THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT. Durban, South Africa.
September 2, 1998</strong></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Honorable Nelson Mandela, President of
South Africa,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Heads of State and Government,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Distinguished delegates and guests,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It was hard enough to withstand the
worldwide feud between two superpowers but to live under the total hegemony of only one is
still worse.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Let&#146;s be clear: it&#146;s impossible
to accept a world order which is the full embodiment of the principles and objectives of a
system that for centuries colonized, enslaved and looted our peoples. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Non-Aligned Movement - the
people&#146;s organization that has put up the strongest fight, provided most support and
resolutely defended the interests, the just causes and the struggles for national
liberation in the Third World, all along the cold war - has not yet seen the last of
itself; it will never do.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There is no need for the Movement to
apologize or ask for anyone&#146;s permission to exist and to go on fighting. Even the
United States earnestly requested to attend this meeting as a guest, so be it. It&#146;s
better that way, so that the great empire may learn how its modest subjects feel.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The United Nations organization must be
reformed and democratized. The Security Council&#146;s dictatorship must cease. The
General Assembly&#146;s rights should be acknowledged as it represents every state in the
world. The Council should be expanded according to the UN present membership and the
permanent members should be twice, and if necessary thrice, the present number.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Why is it that some talk of limiting
membership to one from Latin America and the Caribbean, one from Africa and one from Asia?
Whose idea is it? Who has agreed to that? Why not two or even three to represent the
emerging countries from every one of those regions as they constitute the overwhelming
majority of the UN membership? If Western Europe has two representatives, why is it that
over 4 billion Third World people have only one?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The right to veto must be removed. But, if
that were not possible now, it is still unacceptable to have first and second class
permanent members. Rotation is not an option; it would only serve deceit and confusion, it
would divide and curtail the authority of the new permanent members. They should all enjoy
equal rights.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Likewise, the International Monetary Fund
must be transformed and democratized. It should no longer be a worldwide political
destabilizing factor and a financial policeman for the United States interests. No one
should have the right to veto its decisions. Such principle should also be applied to the
World Bank.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The World Trade Organization, where we are
a majority cannot become, through division and deceit, an instrument of the cruel
neo-liberal globalization imposed on the world. On the other hand, a final and binding
supranational Agreement on Investments as designed by the OECD - an exclusive rich people
club where none of our countries takes part &#151; is unacceptable in as much as it forces
the countries in, or leaves them out, regardless of consequences.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The acclaimed free movement of capital and
commodities must also apply to that which must stand above all else: the human being. No
more bloody walls like that under construction along the American-Mexican border which is
taking a high toll in human lives, hundreds of them, every year. The persecution of
immigrants must cease. Xenophobia must end, not solidarity.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We&#146;ve had enough of the hypocritical
protests of those who strongly complain when others want to produce nuclear weapons: the
mightiest power in the privileged group of those who have it, the one turning its own into
increasingly powerful, accurate and deadly weapons. That encourages the fearful
proliferation and it will never be conducive to a really comprehensive nuclear
disarmament.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The arms race does not stop for a second.
It doesn&#146;t grow quantitatively but it does qualitatively. It only serves as a
guarantee for the privileges of the new order and as the basis of a lucrative and
dishonest business. Weapons are increasingly expensive; they ruin the emerging peoples
that use them to kill each other. Trafficking with weapons is worse than trafficking with
drugs.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Neo-liberal globalization is rapidly
destroying nature, poisoning the air and the waters, killing the forests, causing soil
desertification and erosion, depleting and wasting the natural resources, changing the
climate. How will the 10 billion people we will soon be make a living? What kind of life
will that be?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Development assistance is constantly
reduced. It never reached the projected 0.7 percent of the Gross Domestic Product and, as
an average, it has decreased to 0.25 percent; 0.2 percent in the richest country. They
want to turn us into an immense free zone with cheap labor force and not even taxes to
pay. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">No hopes for the children, the elders and
the sick. And if the population of Africa perishes of AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy
and tens of old and new diseases that is of no concern to the trans-national corporations
and the blind market laws; what counts is the extraction of oil, gold, diamonds, platinum,
copper, chrome, uranium and other valuable resources.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The unipolar world and its global order are
smashing the states sovereignty and independence. Interventions are on the rise. The
always repulsive terrorism that kills or maims innocent people is used as a pretext by the
power that has exercised the most reprehensible forms of terrorism in tens of countries of
Africa, Asia and Latin America - including Cuba - to begin launching missiles in any
direction, regardless of the innocent people who might get killed, heedless of laws,
judges or evidence and doing its own absolute will; that is, the world as a Western film
in the old Hollywood style. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Such reprisals cannot be legally nor
morally justified. That is not the way to fight terrorism; such brutal actions encourage
that which only a universal awareness and a common struggle by the peoples can eradicate.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The economic blockades against the
countries must cease. Depriving millions of people including women, children and elders of
food, medicine and the means to make a living is an extremely cruel act of terrorism, a
real genocide. They should be considered war crimes and punished by the international
courts of law.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The abuses and displacement of the
downtrodden Palestinian people must cease. Peace should be given a chance. The concerted
agreements should be observed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The occupied Arab territories should be
returned. The double standard and the double morale in international affairs must cease.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Hunger and poverty must be completely
eradicated. The lack of teachers and schools, doctors and hospitals must cease.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The endless plundering caused by the
foreign debt, which grows more with every payment thus preventing our development, should
also cease. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Unequal exchange, as practiced by the
conquerors with the natives purchasing gold with mirrors, marbles and European trinkets,
must cease.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The debt accumulated by those who exploited
us for so many centuries must be paid back.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The policy of luring our peoples to pursue
the unsustainable life style of the consumer societies must cease.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The destruction of our national identities
and our cultures must cease.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Many things must cease to exist but first
disunity amongst ourselves must end as well as the ethnic wars and conflicts between our
peoples which should rather struggle for their development and their right to survive and
to take the place they deserve in tomorrow&#146;s world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">One day we will not be separated by our
ethnic origins, nor by national chauvinism or borders, rivers or seas, oceans and
distances. We shall be, above all else, peoples that will unavoidably live in a globalized
world, but a truly just, fraternal and peaceful world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That day we must earn by struggling.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thank you.</font></p>
