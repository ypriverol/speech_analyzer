<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>INTERVIEW GIVEN BY
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF FIDEL CASTRO TO THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PRESS . Assembly Hall of
the University of Havana. <i>23 June 1998</i></strong></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Journalist:</b> <i>How did you like the
lecture [by Rosario Green, Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Mexico]?</font></p>
</i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Fidel Castro:</b> It was a good historical
review, a clear explanation of Mexican policy, always based on specific principles of
respect for the law, following Juarez&#146;s principle whereby respect for the rights of
others is peace. And she explained those principles, with which Mexico has always been
consistent, because it shouldn't be forgotten that Mexico&#146;s was the first social
revolution of this century, even before the Russian Revolution.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It had a remarkable influence in the whole
hemisphere; it had an influence in Cuba. All Latin American revolutionaries perceived
Mexico as a common heritage. We ourselves looked at it that way. When we needed a place to
reorganize ourselves, we chose Mexico. It was practically the only choice.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">After the triumph of the Cuban Revolution,
Mexico set a unique example in the hemisphere: the only country that didn't break off with
Cuba, that firmly maintained relations opposite the pressure of the United States, that
has pursued a firm, consistent international policy at the United Nations.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It shouldn't be forgotten that an important
agreement on states' economic rights and duties, not only Mexico&#146;s dream but the
whole world&#146;s was adopted by the United Nations following a Mexican initiative,
although it was never implemented.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Mexico has opposed the blockade. Mexico has
adopted very firm stands with regard to Cuba opposite all the pressures, whether over in
the Santiago summit or in the last OAS meeting.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This lady, the Mexican foreign minister,
expressed very firm, clear and categorical views at the OAS meeting and they have been
really friendly positions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It's a country that has had to operate
under very difficult geopolitical conditions, as they often say nowadays-a neighbor to the
north, a border of 3,000 kilometers, a wall one hundred times bigger than the Berlin wall,
and a whole series of measures that have been taken against that country, which was the
target of attacks in the last century. A sister nation of this hemisphere, which had half
of its territory snatched by the United States in an unjust war; in other words, a country
that has suffered, that has a strong sense of patriotism, a country where they wanted to
establish an empire, which not only had to fight for its independence but also after,
because they tried to reconquer it from Europe and it had to liberate itself with a heroic
struggle.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So it has had to struggle very hard to
defend its independence and it values all that highly. It values sovereignty highly and
has to defend it in complicated conditions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Look how she recalled, she used a phrase
that I listened to with great interest: &quot;It's the northern border of Latin
America.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I think I should add to that that she was
very careful, as you might have noticed. I am more at liberty to recalling all these
things, but she was very careful and managed to avoid any phrase that might have been of a
confrontational nature toward her neighbor. She was very calm in what she said and careful
in her explanation. That speaks highly of her. She didn't talk about these issues that I'm
referring to here but, at the OAS, she protested very strongly Cuba's exclusion and
defended Cuba.</font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was asking you, Commander, if those
conditions- that attachment to independence, to sovereignty and to international
principles-are precisely what make Cuba and Mexico have so much in common in the
international arena.</font></p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">She explained that when she addressed the
history, when she recalled that Cuba-although it was not yet independent, but where there
was already a national spirit-was the place where Juárez stayed when his country was
going through difficult times.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">At that time, many Mexicans came to Cuba.
Many outstanding Mexicans came to Cuba. They were exiled in Cuba. Well, it's a great honor
for us that Juárez has been here, because Juárez is one of the most illustrious
personalities in Mexico's history, and we're also linked by what she recalled-the presence
of Martí and his activities in Mexico, which we Cubans appreciate so much.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Ours have been two countries that have
helped each other, whose relations have been reciprocal, and I didn't mention before one
of the greatest proofs of Mexico&#146;s merits and its love for independence: it was a
country that recognized the Spanish Republic, that welcomed thousands and thousands of
exiles after the war, that maintained relations with the Spanish Republic when that
republic no longer existed. It was, let's say, an example, a symbol of loyalty to certain
ideals and to certain principles.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">For us, Mexico is very special, because it
was the only country-take good note of this-the only country among the independent
countries from the Rio Grande del Sur [on the U.S-Mexico border] up to here, the only
Latin American country that maintained relations with our country. And it was there right
next door, the nearest to the northern neighbor. No more than two countries in Latin
America have borders with the United States: Mexico and Cuba.</font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Commander, what do you think about the
pressures that the United States is putting on Mexico in matters like drug trafficking and
Chiapas?</font></p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Or in matters like money laundering or
matters of every kind. A lecture could be given on those topics.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They're proof of the empire's growing
arrogance, of its interference in other countries' internal affairs, despite the fact that
Mexico-I have my own theory on this-is a country that scares the United States, because
it's a relatively big country, with resources-above all, a large population. And they've
always been very much afraid of any explosion, crisis, problems in Mexico. They can't
forget the experience of the Mexican Revolution, an event of great historical importance,
which even led to cases of intervention, to more than one case of United States
intervention.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Mexico was the first country to take such
measure as the nationalization of oil, a product of the Mexican Revolution implemented by
Lázaro Cardenas one of its most distinguished men. That was the source of many conflicts.
But, there they have the Mexican oil, which they've defended awesomely against the plans,
the interests and the wishes of the northern neighbors to also gain control of that sector
of the Mexican economy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The United States, as I said, has
intervened several times in Mexico throughout the years of the revolution and also in the
last century. It's an old story. And now they've just carried out a very dirty action
against Mexico, this so-called Operation Casablanca, in which, for three years, their
agents carried out an illegal investigation in that country, without consulting the
government, without any coordination with its authorities.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I would say that this was an act of
tremendous disloyalty, which has hurt us all a lot, not only the Mexicans. What they did
is like the work of gangsters: sending agents, investigating, organizing a party over in
Las Vegas-I think the exact place is called Casagrande. They invited a number of Mexican
bank officials to a big party there and arrested them along with several Venezuelans. And
I'm not judging the matters related to the offenses or illegal actions they might have
committed. I mean the methods used: conducting an investigation for three years and then
tricking those people in order to capture them in the United States and setting up a huge
scandal over that, for the miserable results that they got; investigating money-laundering
operations, if they can be called money-laundering operations for the meager sum of 30, 40
or 50 million, when the American banks have laundered the most dollars in this world.
They've laundered hundreds of billions of dollars, and almost all of the drug money has
been laundered by the United States banks themselves.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">All that operation, all that offense, to
simply discover what happened with a few tens of millions of dollars and setting up a huge
scandal with which to discredit Mexico, to offend it, humiliate it and Venezuela, too.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I read a cable that said that their hope
was the information that the detainees might be able to give on many other bankers. One is
amazed that actions of that nature can be committed against such a cautious, such a
respectful neighbor as Mexico is. It's something really outrageous and I believe that the
Mexicans are rightly outraged.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">She didn't want to tackle that kind of
topic, for the reasons that I mentioned. She was cautious. She gave an academic lecture.
But they're firm in their policies and they know their subject very well.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You have to bear in mind the difficult and
complex conditions in which the Mexicans have to struggle, and they resist the pressures
as much as they can, in a situation in which they have be in incessant contact every day.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Look at how things are-every day of the
year, one million Mexicans cross the border to and from the U.S. In other words, more than
350 million arrivals and departures of Mexicans. I'm not speaking about the few that go
there to work with a legal permit. I'm referring to those who usually cross because they
live in Mexico and they go to places near the border but in United States territory, to do
a lot of jobs that the North Americans are no longer willing to do. If they want a garden,
it's a Mexican that cares for it. If tomatoes or something need picked, it's a Mexican
that picks tomatoes. If there's any hard, low-paid job, it's the Mexican that does it. But
what happens? Despite all that, the wages on the other side of the border are higher than
on this side of the border and many Mexicans who have their families, their houses on
Mexican territory cross over and go back.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">One of the other things causing huge
pressure is the gigantic wall that they've put up there-a high number of Mexicans die
trying to cross that wall to go establish themselves there for economic reasons, as part
of the migratory movements worldwide generated by the economic situation in the Third
World countries, in the poorest countries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So, it's a war the United States is waging
against the immigrants. They've taken a host of measures resulting in the death of a large
number of Mexicans. I don't know the exact figure of those who might have died trying to
cross over, but I have the impression that those who now die every year crossing that wall
are more than those who died during the whole time that the Berlin Wall existed, because,
to cross over, they go through deserts, they go through dangerous places.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They've even told me that they sometimes
have to cross the expressways, where the cars go at fantastic speeds; they sometimes walk
in the middle, along the median strip of the expressways, trying to escape. They die in
accidents, while being chased, or they die of thirst or of asphyxia or from police shots.
That is, they have to endure all that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There's an anti-Latin American,
anti-immigration spirit within the United States, which is growing like in Europe, and
that's the result of underdevelopment, of the existence of a world that has remained
under-developed as a consequence of plunder and exploitation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, these rich countries are scared and
they're taking more and more extreme action. They even adopt racist xenophobic positions,
very similar to some policies implemented by the fascists in their time.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That phenomenon of immigrants persecution
is growing. In other words, it's not only the pressures that you mentioned-there are many
other ways in which they put on pressure.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Mexicans have to fight every day even
for the implementation of the agreement, because the others invent non-tariff measures. If
they find a little spot on a piece of fruit, they say: &quot;No, there's a pest. Those
products can't come in.&quot; They cause obstructions; they impose very restrictive
measures with transport. There could be a truck with fruit, with avocados, with
vegetables, and then the difficulties in crossing to the other side are tremendous. It's
costfull. They place obstacles, using different pretexts, against trucks traveling through
United States territory, while United States trucks travel through the whole of Mexico,
which has many highways and has been building more and more highways.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Mexican trucks don't have the same
facilities for transporting products for export and then, just imagine, they keep them
there for hours on end, in unending queues, while they search them, looking for drugs or
immigrants-every kind of demand thus hindering exports.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, they do that with other countries,
too. Non-tariff measures will come into vogue as customs tariffs disappear.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They apply formulas to the Chileans, for
example, and they don't want to let their salmon in, or they set very high tariffs on them
simply because they compete with the salmon that the Americans produce in California. They
put pressure on them there and then they say that the salmon in Chile is subsidized and
they increase the tariffs on it and apply every kind of measure. Sometimes, they' are
sanitary regulations. They find a bunch of grapes that has a problem or something and they
say that there's this or that pest and they stop the import of Chilean grapes and other
products.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In fact, they're having to fight a strong,
powerful, domineering, arrogant neighbor, used to giving orders.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That's why the idea that I mentioned from
the lecture caught my attention. I thought it over a little and I bore in mind the true
situation, whereby they're there opposite those neighbors.</font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Commander, the foreign minister spoke about
the free-trade agreement with countries of the region, Latin American countries. Does Cuba
hope to sign a free-trade agreement with Mexico? Is this an aspiration?</font></p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">She didn't say a single word about that,
seemingly out of fear of the United States. But we hold Mexico in high esteem and we're
very careful in our relations with that sister nation. Relations develop, trade develops
and there are other important things. We have certain agreements on investment, on other
things. We're starting to do things; we're starting to move forward. It seems to me that
this isn't an issue that we should address during this visit-agreements of that sort that
could be relatively important now and, on the other hand, be a reason for great irritation
on the part of the United States. We shouldn't raise or tackle issues or request measures
that, although very legitimate, could, under the present circumstances, cause problems,
conflict or antagonism between the United States and Mexico. I'd say that it would be a
sensitive subject.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I listened one by one to each country that
she mentioned. They themselves told me what they're doing. I believe, really, that Mexico
should develop its relations as much as possible with the rest of the world -with Europe,
with the Asian countries, with the rest of Latin America-because the more relations it
develops with the rest of the world, the more possibilities it will have to maintain an
independent policy, given that more than 80 per cent of its exports -I don't know if it's
already 82 per cent to 84 per cent-go to the United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There's a true fact: They say that what the
[North American] Free-Trade Agreement did was to provide a judicial framework to a de
facto situation that already existed. Due to the circumstances of their geographical
proximity, there were already some economic relations based on exports to the United
States, which were very high-around 70 percent-and unregulated. They feel the treaty
regulates a de facto situation that already existed while it gives them more possibilities
to defend their interests than they had without the treaty. That's how they feel about it.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, the treaty presents its problems
and its consequences, isn&#146;t it so? The treaty should be analyzed now and with a view
to the future as the years go by. The Yankees draw up their strategies for the long term
and, as time passes, they'll have more possibilities to penetrate the Mexican economy, to
take control of important branches and to export their goods to Mexico. There are many
problems still to be discussed, including many agreements that will enter into force
within 10 years, 15 years. But the day will come when there will be almost no obstacle
whatsoever to any kind of good or service and, naturally, the partner is a very powerful
partner, very ambitious, very rich and that poses a certain risk, don&#146;t you think?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So, I see the Mexican strategy as one
concerned over developing as much as possible and securing as much investment as possible
from everywhere.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The assumption was-and I thought it would
be that way-that the treaty could attract lots of capital not only from the United States
but also from other countries, because there are many businessmen who want to penetrate
the United States market and, if their industries are there in Mexico, then their products
can be exported to the United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In Mexico, there have not only been
economic problems but difficult political problems as well-in other words, a complicated
situation in politics, too. And then there was a huge crisis as a result of the large
amount of short-term capital invested there. The speculative operations, in my opinion,
reduced the possibilities for greater investment from other countries in Mexico.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Certain things one should not ask, right?
Because we're not going to go around questioning the Mexicans about their strategies or
about what they might be thinking. You have make your own inferences and it seemed to me
that a lot of capital was going to flow from other regions into Mexico. Nevertheless,
invest-ment has increased a lot.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I think I could infer that the Mexicans
were trying to gain time, to strengthen their economy, strengthen their industry in order
to be in a better position to live together and coexist as neighbors and as partners with
an economic, technological, cultural, political and military monster such as the United
States is. In other words, it's a hard struggle to defend their identity and to defend
their sovereignty under difficult conditions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But all these phenomena must be looked at
in an even longer term, because two trends are emerging in the world: regional economic
agreements or, let's just say, to shorten it, regional agreements and multilateral
agreements. There are two parallel trends. I could observe that in Geneva, at the WTO.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Yankees have always been more inclined
toward the multilateral. They're even accusing Clinton of having abandoned the traditional
policy of looking for multilateral agreements, because they want everything to be global.
But, now, with their characteristic pragmatism and their immense ambitions, they're like a
fisherman with two hooks or, if you like, with two long lines-they're fishing with the
hook of regional agreements and with the hook of multilateral agreements, looking for a
North American Free-Trade Agreement here and a Free-Trade Agreement of the Americas there
in Latin America. They aren't very, very, very fond-not at all, you could say-of Mercosur
or the Latin American Integration Association or of any form of Latin American economic
unity. They don't want any of that. They want discussions one by one, with every country
in the region if possible. They don't want to see unity because in unity lies strength.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If I were to dream, I would have wished for
Latin Americans to have united first and then later discussed altogether with the powerful
northern neighbor.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Unfortunately, the Latin Americans have
been unable to overcome the obstacles, to overcome the intrigues that imperialism has used
to prevent them from uniting.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Right now, they've devised things, such as
a possible arms race in the region, the unrestricted sale of sophisticated weapons. And
that gives rise to the situation whereby, if Argentina buys weapons, the Chileans buy; if
the Chileans buy, the Peruvians buy; if the Peruvians buy, the Ecuadoreans buy; and if
they buy, the Brazilians buy too.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Why, at this precise moment, are they
removing all restrictions on the sale of sophisticated weapons? Why do they proclaim
certain countries to be their strategic allies? It's something very strange, a very
strange little trick.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Then it turns out that, now, the
Argentinean military government is the strategic ally of the United States. The
Argentinean military played a significant role in Central America. They sent special
intelligence and training groups to work with the counter-revolutionaries in the dirty war
in Nicaragua and to repress the revolutionary movement in El Salvador.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Argentinean military were so excited
that they felt encouraged, believing that they already had a strategic ally, to invade the
Malvinas [Falklands], in an ill-prepared operation, making loads of military mistakes. A
lot could be said about that but it would take a long time because they were even buying
weaponry in Europe-the famous Exocet missiles, which could be launched from 300 kilometers
and fly, undetected, right on the sea surface ; and, at that time, the warships lacked the
technology for repelling them. They'd bought around 80 in France. Imagine-they were so
excited that they didn't even wait for those missiles to arrive.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Among the Argentinean military, those who
acted with the most daring and bravery were the pilots. I met and talked with a group of
them when I was there in [San Carlos de] Bariloche. I had to make a stopover at a base
that was the base from where those planes used to leave that attacked and sank some
British ships. They sent ill-prepared soldiers who could not even operate the missiles.
They'd only received a few missiles from the batch they'd bought. Had they waited six or
seven months, the Argentinean pilots could have sunk the squadron of Her British Majesty.
Yes, that's what I say, objectively.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I've read quite a lot about that war. I
know all those details and I analyze the mistakes that were made. They got excited because
they were rendering important services in Central America. Now, they're being declared
strategic allies. That's not very clear, not at all. If there's a war in the Gulf, they
send a ship to the Gulf. That's far away-the Malvinas are much closer. And it's not that
I'm advising that any ships be sent to the Malvinas but, if a ship can't be sent to the
Malvinas, there's no reason to send it so far in order to see a war on CNN.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In that type of war, with intelligent
weapons, Cruise missiles and invisible bombers that escape radar surveillance, the
cooperation they can give is very, very modest.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Yankees would certainly like, for
example, to create a Pan-American intervention force, so as not to send their troops if
any situation were to arise.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A high-ranking United States official said
a few weeks ago that, for example, a fire in the Amazon, which could affect the atmosphere
and thus the United States, would justify military intervention in Brazil. Come on!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There's also talk, comments, discussions
about possible intervention in Colombia, under one pretext or other.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They'd like a Pan-American peace force that
would go to war in those places and not them, just like they also want one in Africa after
the experience of Somalia -interventionist forces.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They'd also like to have them in Latin
America but I think that, currently, despite the respect that many Latin American
governments still have for the United States, despite their habits of submission and
deference, today's world is different. There are different interests, and people are more
aware. It would be hard for the United States to succeed in creating a contingent of
Pan-American troops, but they'd love to do it. However, I don't think that the Latin
Americans will be caught with that little hook or that big hook.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That's what I think, but their strategy can
be clearly seen: create economic divisions, invent all sorts of things, turn everything
into a bone of contention- weapons sales, the category of strategic allies-faced with a
potential seat on the Security Council, to try to have several candidates come forward and
then divide them with Machiavellian tactics.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Who was it who said &quot;Divide and
rule&quot;? I think that's from the epoch of the Roman Empire. The tactic of divide and
rule. Look how old it is, from the time of the biggest empire that ever existed before
this one. No, the British empire came after. But the first great empire already had the
motto of divide and rule, just like how, in some countries' domestic policy, their
politics is to divide: divide and weaken, divide and destroy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Part of their great rage against Cuba is
that they haven't been able to divide or destroy, despite the enormous efforts they've
made.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But, well, there are all these factors,
from the political and economic point of view.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That's why we are decidedly in favor of
European integration. The Yankees don't like it much. We're in favor of the euro. The
Yankees don't much like the euro and they dream. They say: &quot;Oh, very good! That will
be successful.&quot; But what they want, desire and dream about is for the euro to fail so
that the dollar continues being the only reserve currency in the world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It would suit the world to have a strong
currency that could, at some time, compete with the dollar, and if another was to arise
too. But they're not interested in that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I'm telling you, they're fishing with two
hooks. And I'm repeating this because there are two important movements at this time: one,
aimed at removing all barriers at world level, a world free-trade agreement, and trying to
use the WTO for that, with the drawback in the WTO that there are many Third World
countries in it. That's what I stated in Geneva: we must be united. Let the Chinese join;
let Russia and the other countries of the former USSR join. Let them all join. They put
obstacles and conditions in their way because they control that. They're in control
because, well, it's known that they have enough power for that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They print the world's currency. They've
turned paper into gold. Before, it had a gold value but not now. Since Nixon abolished
that, the dollar is no longer convertible into gold. But the world has no other currency.
They print the paper and the others keep it. They don't save and yet they're the ones who
invest the most in the world using other peoples&#146; money.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They'd like to see an accelerated process
of multilateral agreements leading to the complete removal of all obstacles to investment
by their transnationals, to American investments, technology and trade.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You see, this question is so complicated
that even many Americans don't understand it. In the final analysis, it suits their
imperial interests but they've laid obstacles for their government.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In that sense, Clinton was applying an
intelligent strategy for the empire's economic interests. And Clinton cares a lot about
the transnationals' interests, because he's one of those who makes a phone call to
whatever country, whatever government whenever their companies are trying to compete to
get some concession or some deal. He's got telephones for that. He works very much in line
with the companies. But, in the United States itself and inside his party, he has
opponents because they have certain fears.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Some have links with the trade unions and
they're afraid that some factory might be pulled out of there and taken to the other side
of the border with Mexico because wages are much lower there; or that they might be taken
to the Dominican Republic, where there are 80 free-trade zones; or that they might be
taken to Central America, where the wages are 20 or 30 times lower than in the United
States. And some workers are afraid that the companies might take those factories away. A
certain number of legislators are associated with those trade unions and, so, in certain
ways, they hinder the policy of the empire and they've denied Clinton the fast-track
procedure. They obstruct his plans, the voracious plans of the empire, his hopes of
gulping down and swallowing up Latin America's economy-turning Latin America into a region
of assembly plants and nobody knowing where on earth their products would end up, because
there aren't enough markets.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Canada-United States relationship is
something different. The Canadians export energy-they even export water, because the
United States is running out of drinking water- electricity from hydroelectric plants and
high-technology products.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In Canada, nobody produces shoes or jeans
to export to the United States. Their trade amounts to one billion a day, but they export
other things.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Mexicans do export oil, gas, other raw
materials, many products for the assembly-plant industries, which produce items on very
low wages. The trade between Canada and the United States, two developed countries, is
different from the trade that Mexico and other countries, Central America and other
countries, have with the United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">To wrap up this idea, I'd like to say that,
after the empire has been fishing with two hooks, working intensively, they now want to
speed up the Free-Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) and they've run into obstacles
because that could take years. And the American representatives suggested there, in South
America, that there was no need to wait all that time and that, instead of a final
agreement, they could start making partial agreements. A little trick to first start
agreeing on those things that interest them most and leaving to the end the most
complicated things , those of interest to Latin Americans. If they accepted those
proposals-well, they'd have to be idiots-the result would be that, when they seat to
discuss what interests them they would have nothing to bargain with. And they've at least
had the common sense to tell them No.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This whole policy is very clear. I'm trying
to explain to you that there's an economic and political strategy: to weaken, to divide,
in different ways. Using every possible way, they're attacking, defending their economic
interests, those of their transnationals.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, since there are two ways, the two have
started advancing somewhat. It seems more logical, it would perhaps be more interesting
for the Third World, to have regional unity first so as to command enough power for
discussion. Otherwise, it's a fight between an ant and an elephant.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Europe itself has had to unite, while being
a group of very developed countries, in order to be able to put up a fight and compete, so
that it is not left out of the game. And, what's more, if it acted carelessly, it might be
left out. At the moment, they're strongly defending there matters related to the
entertainment industry. They don't want to hand over their television channels and movies
to American companies. They want to defend their culture. There are certain things that
they're struggling to defend.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They have to unite. If they don't do, Soros
will come along. He already did it with their currencies. One day, he did away with the
Spanish peseta; the next day, it was the franc; the day after, the lira; after that, the
pound sterling. All that was European. Unity is not happening as a result of philosophical
reasoning but of a vital need to achieve stability and economic independence.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I want you to know that unity means a
substantial relinquishment, which has already started taking place, of the sovereignty of
the European national states. Now, when the euro begins, there will be an absolutely
independent European central bank. Governments will no longer be able to operate with
their currency or make monetary policies: increasing interest rates to prevent inflation,
lowering interest rates etc. Those prerogatives, which are among the most important for a
developed country will exist no more. They're being handed over to a bank.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The neoliberalization policies are also
part of an offensive against the popular forces; they do away with the trade unions, and
practically with everything, in order to do away with the advances extracted by the
workers in many of those countries after the World War II, more than in the United States,
since there they were faced with the presence of the socialist bloc and the USSR and they
feared communism. Neoliberalization policies are now trying to put all those advances
behind.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They haven't been able to solve the problem
of unemployment. They've got a lot of problems. But Europe has to unite in order to be
sufficiently strong.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, China doesn't have to unite with
anybody, because China is a force by itself. Those in south-east Asia will have to unite
and Russia will have no choice but to rise on its feet. It would be a tragedy otherwise.
It's an extremely complicated situation. Even in the field of economics, the symptoms can
be seen.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Right now, that country is in a very deep
crisis. They are making great effort but nobody has the answer. Again, it all depends on
the Monetary Fund lending it 10 or 15 billion. Some say that there's no need; others have
said that there's an urgent need for 10 to 15 billion. But the Monetary Fund has no more
funds. They virtually ran out of funds in south-east Asia because of what it had to use
there and in South Korea. The Monetary Fund is left with between 10 and 15 billion in
reserve. And now the Russians are asking for 10 to 15 billion. Those from south-east Asia,
when the relapse comes, will need more money. Japan needs money to strengthen the yen,
another clever maneuver of the northern neighbors: buy yen because, if the yen continues
falling, it could end up making the south-east Asian economy collapse. And we're living at
a time of great risks and possibly a time of a relatively imminent global economic crisis.
It doesn't mean that it would be the last or that it would be the end of capitalism. It
may be that more than one will be needed. But there are risks and they're on the run.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What weapons do they use? Well, lies. Since
panic is an ingredient of financial crises in the stock markets and, in turn, the stock
markets are in grave danger because in the United States stocks are grossly overrated,
there is the risk of a crisis; they are in a panic that everybody may start selling their
stocks, that the value of these stocks might fall drastically and that the millions of
middle-class people that Clinton talks about might be ruined, and still that there might
be a crisis like that of 1929.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They're devising things to avoid that, but
there's still no device. There's no way to square the circle. And now they're coming up
with all these things. The Fund can't do it any more, it doesn't have enough funds.
Clinton has asked for 18 billion for the IMF but the right wing in the United States has
said &quot;No way&quot; and they have opposed giving the 18 billion to strengthen the Fund
a bit.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What did it do then, when the yen was
loosing value threatening to drag down other economies and create a disaster that could
spread to Latin America? Because there are some countries where the conditions exist, and
some very important countries. In Brazil, let's say, the conditions exist for the actions
of speculators, due to the well-known fact that there is an overvalued currency, a large
budget deficit and a significant current-account deficit, plus the risks that, in terms of
exports, derive from the fact that, as products from south-east Asia get cheaper with the
crisis, their exports may be affected. In other words, there are vulnerable countries,
very vulnerable, and if that crisis reaches a country like Brazil, it will immediately
drag in Argentina and others and it could relapse and even reach Mexico. That's the real
situation that exists.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It was when the yen started to fall
dangerously for the world economy that the fright came. The Yankees, who impose every sort
of condition on the Japanese, are telling them: &quot;Open your doors and windows&quot;,
while the Japanese always said: &quot;Development, yes, but with the savings of the
Japanese&quot;-who are the ones who save the most in the world-&quot;the Japanese banks,
the Japanese insurance companies, the Japanese industry.&quot; On this occasion, they've
had to rush to slow down the fall of the yen.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Did they do it out of philanthropy? No, but
rather because of the consequences that fall could have beyond certain limits. They rushed
and invested eight billion. They raised the value of the yen a little, from 146 to 138 to
a dollar. But you never know, because they're faced with uncontrollable phenomena.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They defended themselves with lies. They
said: &quot;No, everything's fine. The economy's wonderful. The United States is in no
danger. It has lower unemploy-ment than ever before. There's no inflation and there's a
budget surplus and all that.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">That's the tactic of the International
Monetary Fund and the dominant power. Every time there's a crisis somewhere that threatens
the system's interests, Clinton immediately comes out and says: &quot;Everything's great.
The measures that they've taken are brilliant.&quot; And the man from the Federal Reserve
comes out: &quot;No problem.. The measures they've taken are wonderful. The economy's
doing great; everything's great.&quot; And the man from the World Bank comes out:
&quot;Everything's great.&quot; And the Chairman of the Fund at the head of them all, so
as to avoid panic.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now, with the latest Russian financial
crisis, the Russians devised I don't know how many things to bring in some money, because
one of the Russians&#146; problems is tax collection. There's no way those people who
became multimillionaires overnight and took between 200 and 300 billion dollars abroad
would pay taxes. So, if there's no money from tax, the teachers can't be paid, neither can
the employees- absolutely no-one.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What is the Monetary Fund doing? While
they've postponed delivering 670 million from a previous credit that they had granted,
which they are handing over in bits and pieces, they are asking the Russians to privatize
gas, oil, whatever is left out there. They're imposing conditions, such as that they
collect the taxes. They're not hurrying, no. When the others are desperate, that's the
time to make demands. That's the tactic. On the other hand, they praise to the skies the
measures proposed by the new government, to build up confidence and win time.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">They're now talking about things that
happened in south-east Asia that they didn't talk about before, when they spoke about the
development of the countries of south-east Asia and said: &quot;These are the models. This
is the model for the world.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">When the disaster came about, they started
relating everything that was happening with the banks: banking policy, the way in which
credit was distributed, privileges, corruption etc. But they had not said a single word
about that before. They have deceived the world, they resort to lies as much as they can
and they use the Monetary Fund to support an imperial and dominant policy. This time, they
rushed to buy yens with the United States' own money. They'll have to sell them later and
they're imposing tough conditions: &quot;Change. Open your doors wide to United States
investment. Go down on your knees.&quot; This is what they're saying to the Japanese
government and the Japanese seem to find it difficult to go down on their knees. They've
resisted as much as possible.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was saying that there were two ways:
regional agreements and multilateral agreements. In the end, they come together in this
unstoppable globalization process-the transnationals are already the ones that really rule
the world. There's no program or common sense, nor can there be-just the market, which
solves each and every thing; the market, which decides everything.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The market-as I put it the other day-is a
mad, ferocious beast running wild and creating chaos everywhere. That's the world economic
situation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Since we started talking about Mexico,
which is now in that agreement, when it is multilateralism that prevails, Mexico will be
in the same conditions as the rest. In other words, they're now in partnership with the
northern neighbor and, afterward, they'll have to be in partnership with the world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The question that must be asked is what's
going to happen next, if that world is sustainable from the economic point of view,
because the globalized world that we can see coming is a world that was conceived more
than 150 years ago.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">This was going to happen as a result of the
development of the productive forces and technology- Marx talked about that 150 years
ago-but it's only now that it can be seen in full strength.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It's growing, its movement irrepressible.
There is no going back. Nobody can stop it. The United States, of course, doesn't want to.
But, even if it wanted to, it can't, because there are many forces at play within itself:
the attorney-general does one thing, Congress does another and the President does
something else. Well, the domestic situation is rather chaotic for making decisions. They
can't implement a coherent strategy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Clinton has quite a clear economic
strategy, in favor of the economic interests of his transnationals. But he can't even
implement it fully. Those who have tens of billions don't ask anybody where they're going
to invest, what currency they're going to buy, what sort of speculation they're going to
carry out.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Do you know who makes the decisions? The
computers. They give them a series of parameters, just like those they taught to play
chess, and they tell them what to do after the opposing player&#146;s every move. And then
they tell them: &quot;If the opponent moves this pawn, move this one.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It's now practically the computers that are
giving the orders to the agents of finance capital: &quot;Sell this currency right now,
quickly. Buy this other one. Sell such and such stocks from such and such a country. Buy
this other one. Move so many million over here; move so much over there.&quot; The money
is not even American money anymore; it's the transnationals' money. That's the situation.
They're the ones that decide what is most essential in today's world, the movement of
capital. Who can stop the world's finances in a globalized world? Nobody can.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It's been a while since the transnationals
were internationalized. We could say, in this regard, that the transnationals are
internationalists. (<i>Laughter.</i>) They no longer have a homeland. They turn to the
government so that they defend them-nothing more. If there's a little problem, some
conflict-&quot;Hey, look, somebody's breaking off a piece of me.&quot; Then the United
States government starts to take measures. The transnationals are running wild around the
world. They're the ones that rule it. It's chaotic!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The environment-what do the transnationals
care about the environment?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are things that can be seen clearly
and this is very important for today's young people because they're going to live through
all that. They are going to live through the whole globalization process, with the
transnationals running wild throughout the world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">So, what about the environment? Among other
things, the situation with nature is a very serious problem, very serious indeed, very
serious. Well, it isn't just Rubiera [from the Havana Weather Bureau] talking about that
now. It's not just a theoretician talking about that. (<i>Laughter.</i>) It's the
neighbors who suddenly go through a tremendous heat wave; or it's a country where it
suddenly rains 80 times in 110 days of the sugar harvest, like in Matanzas, and then it
doesn't rain when the sugar cane should be sown-a disaster; hurricanes that don't come
from the east and then come from the west.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What kind of winds were those of over a 100
kilometers speed that tore down banana trees? They were hurricanes from the west and not
one, but several. The sea hasn't penetrated there, but the damage that these winds do to
the banana plantations, fruit trees and other crops is considerable.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There was a hurricane in Moscow. Can you
imagine a hurricane in Moscow? A hurricane went from north to south-more than 1,000
injured, nobody knows how much destruction, winds of more than 100 kilometers in Moscow.
Heat of I don't know how many degrees -almost more than in Havana. So, the damage against
the environment is a fact. It's not speculation from theoreticians. The task of the future
generation in this coming century, among others, is to save the environment.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It's a chaotic world. That world that
capitalist globalization is leading to can't survive. It can't be sustained. It inevitably
brings about crises. That's why I was explaining that the methods of the last century were
no longer the most advisable, nor those of the first half of this century, nor even those
from after the triumph of the revolution, because there was a time of world equilibrium.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Revolutions like Cuba&#146;s could have
happened in Latin America, because all the objective conditions were there. It was the
subjective factors that weren't there. But, today things are different. They are global.
It's the strength of the people, their education and awareness. The masses, with their
growing power, will be the ones to solve these problems.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Today, it's not really a case of a country
having to do this or that. A revolution triumphs, for example, in an isolated country in
Central America today; what would happen to it in this world I have described? How long
would it last? How long would it last when the Inter-American Bank comes and cancels all
its credit and another one comes and cancels all its credit and another one comes and
closes its markets? They won't need to fire a single shot.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It would almost be advisable to say:
&quot;Revolutionaries, be patient.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If they win the elections-this is something
I said in the women's meeting; that hasn't been published yet, because I want to
double-check that material, but I haven't had time-, they'll first have to start making a
whole load of concessions so that some are not frightened. Otherwise, they tell them:
&quot;This guy's going to scare away capital because the things he's saying are too
radical.&quot; They have to tone down their language, even their programs. When they enter
the government there's not much that they can do from there, not even a left-wing party.
The others already have all the mass media in their hands, all the resources, capital,
technology. They have everything.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Of course, we mustn't discourage anyone
from fighting. On the contrary, we have to tell everybody to struggle wherever they might
be: if it's in a factory, then in a factory; in a trade union, wherever; women, students,
small farmers.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are, for example, very interesting
movements, like the Landless Movement in Brazil, something new -land lying idle while they
wait till doomsday for a land reform so they can occupy it. There are also homeless
movements, where there are loads of empty houses and they go and move into the houses.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Mass movements are emerging that are being
built up with tremendous force and I believe that those movements will play a fundamental
role in future struggles.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There will be other tactics. It will no
longer be Bolshevik-style tactics or even tactics like ours, because those tactics
belonged to a different world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In today's world, the one that I've been
trying to define, new tactics have to emerge, but this doesn't mean discouraging anybody,
anywhere, from doing things as they see fit. But we try to see and analyze, with the
greatest possible objectivity, the current situation and the development of the struggle,
under the unipolar domain of one superpower-the United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There will be other ways and other roads
along which the conditions will start being created so that that global world is
transformed into another world. I can't conceive of any other globalization that isn't a
socialist globalization. There can be no other. And also-and I understand this
perfectly-the world is moving toward forms of international government, of world
govern-ment. There's a definite plan. The United Nations is the first embryo, although, of
course, now quite limited by the United States.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There's currently discussion of the idea of
an international criminal court. What do the Americans want? That it be under the aegis of
the Security Council, where they impose their policies. What do the representatives of
many governments and hundreds of organizations represented there want? That it be truly
independent so that it can judge, without one country coming along and exercising the
veto.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What if somebody's committing war crimes?
The United States will veto the trial if it's a friend or an ally. The United States is
the country that has most used that prerogative.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">And what are war crimes? We have stated
that the economic blockade must counted among the most serious war crimes against the
people. Yes, let there be an international criminal court. Excellent! But let it be
independent and not under the aegis of the Security Council-if they want, under the
control of the General Assembly. That would be acceptable.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Mexican minister said that her country
was struggling for more powers for the General Assembly. In fact, the General Assembly has
been made worthless. It's almost a talking shop, an institution to shape world opinion and
express points of view where one with the right to veto can nullify any agreement adopted
by that body. We have to struggle to gain authority for the United Nations General
Assembly.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The United States has established a
dictatorship in the Security Council, with the right to veto even an agreement adopted by
a majority of the Security Council. There could be 10 that agree on something but there's
no agreement if the United States says No. There could be nine and it says no; there could
be eight and it says no. There could be 14 and there's no agreement because they veto it.
They veto any agreement, from eight to 14, because, with only seven, there can be no
agreement. Having from eight to 14 in favor of something, they can veto it and that's
that. That's clear. They control the Security Council thanks to their economic power,
their pressures, and their control of the mechanisms. But they can't control the Assembly,
that's more difficult.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We're always urging the countries there
too: Unite! To all the Third World countries: Unite! Imperialism deceives. It leads one
country along a certain wrong course. It raises expectations for one country while it
promises another something else. And, as I said before, it tries to divide the Latin
American countries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The world will need a government; the 21st
century will need a government. Who's going to stop them from destroying what's left of
nature, of the seas or the air? If the world is globalized and if all the economies become
totally intertwined, who's going to govern? The transnationals can't govern. They're at
war among themselves-competition, mergers, everything.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The world needs an order. There is need for
a universal, global, just and democratic order. There's an order coming, one that can be
seen coming at full speed, unstoppable: it's the neoliberalization going global. We have
to start thinking about an order of a different kind and, in the meantime, denounce and
struggle.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I have great confidence in the peoples and
in the masses and that confidence has been strengthened through my experience on
international trips, in the United Nations, in meetings like the one in Rio de Janeiro,
wherever. The power of the truth can be great and when you get there and speak the truth,
then you're saying what the vast majority is thinking but can't say. That's why I say that
they have given us now the almost exclusive privilege of being able to speak the truth.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We have a monopoly over the freedom to
speak the truth. Many others know the truth but they can't speak out.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I really feel very free to speak. And not
only free because I don't just devote myself to speaking the truth it is all part of a
strategy. We need more than truth, we need a strategy. Saying what you have to say when
you have to say it-not before, not after. Not to divide forces but to bring them together,
aware that the main problem is uniting as many as possible around that objective. Not
opening up 10 different fronts at a time -the minimum of fronts, preferably one. And
there's already one really important front that's enough to concentrate many
causes-imperialism, the hegemonic power and its policy of world domination. Well, it's the
one that gives orders or wants to tell everybody what they have to do. And many do it;
others rebel, others put up resistance. That's how it is.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Mexico's problems, regarding its economic
partnership with the United States through the Free-Trade Agreement that you were
interested in before are, in my opinion, of a temporary nature, because developments and
the unfolding of circumstances will dissolve that kind of agreement into multilateralism,
and economic interrelations between countries will prevail. Cuba, which is not on planet
Mars, will have to be admitted into all the international institutions, because even the
people in the United States are putting up more and more resistance to the whole madness
of the blockade against our country. They feel increasingly ashamed. And the world's
condemnation of the blockade is unanimous.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We mustn't lose patience-no concessions,
not the slightest concession. This country won't make the slightest concession to the
blockade. It won't make the slightest concession to the pressures. We'll do what's good
for the country, what's good for the revolution, what's good for the people, and under the
same principle of unity and consensus.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We'll also have to fulfill our duty to
educate our people, because we're faced with these new situations and it's essential that
the many people who learned how to read and write understand them. That's why I've talked
at great length more than once these days, because what I'm trying to do is get our people
to learn and understand more and more.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I remember the first years of the
revolution, when we had to convince a lot of people and we sometimes convinced them with
revolutionary laws but also by explaining, explaining and explaining.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are a number of people who don't
understand. In the first place, there are people who don't read newspapers, who don't
listen to the news, who don't know anything-who go around absent-mindedly. That's why I
said recently that there are adults who also need special education. (<i>Laughter.</i>)
But the number of those who understand is high and, if they don't understand more, it's
our fault, really. We shouldn't blame anyone else.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">You wanted to ask a small question? Well,
since I've kept you waiting, even if it's only a couple of words, because I have to do
other things. I was going to be here for five minutes and you've all kept me much longer.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Very good. We're delighted to welcome the
president of Colombia. He's the chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. His
government has maintained a friendly attitude toward us and, as such, we'll welcome him
with full honors and all due consideration.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">He's coming for a meeting of public-health
ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement. It's an important meeting and he wants to open that
meeting. Of course, he's been invited to visit us. After the meeting ends, there will be a
brief official visit to our country.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It will be very interesting talking with
him, because we're very interested in listening to different points of view. We're very
interested in what's happening in Colombia. You have to learn and you learn by listening,
not by talking. By talking, you can exercise your mind a little but, by listening, you
gather information, ideas, points of view and you learn. What you listen to is the raw
material of what you can work on later in your brain.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We've had a lot of very interesting visits
in these past days: the foreign minister of Italy; the president of the Socialist
International, [Pierre] Mauroy, a man with great experience. He was prime minister of
France. Can you imagine what that visitor knows about Europe, the world and many things,
what he thinks, what his views are on these same topics that we're talking about
here-Europe, integration, the euro? What is his vision, his points of view, which I try to
and need to know?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Zyuganov came recently-a very intelligent
man, very well informed. As a representative of an important and influential political
force, it's of great interest knowing his points of view on the situation in Russia, a
country that really interests us and which we fervently wish can emerge from the crisis
and avoid disintegration. That would be terrible.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are menacing evils and sometimes such
evils come quickly. For example, in 30 days, four things occurred: the relapse of the
economic crisis in south-east Asia; the political and social crisis in Indonesia; 11
nuclear tests in southern Asia, with the risk of seeing, for the first time, the emergence
of the possibility of regional nuclear wars-that danger wasn't there till now; a deep and
acute economic crisis in Russia. Four things in 30 days! Well, and these problems are
emerging when many other serious problems haven't been resolved yet.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We're very interested in gathering
information, opinions. Recently we also had the visit of France's minister of transport.
He's a Party member, a communist in a coalition with the Socialists.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Spanish minister of industries, who
also delivered a lecture today in the Assembly Hall, is unquestionably a very able man,
very intelligent. It's a delight talking with him. He knows a lot and he is a very serious
person.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We've had the privilege of receiving a
number of visitors and, of course, we learn from all of them. We don't talk much about
Cuba. We say: Look, Cuba's a small island, which is in this hemisphere, not on another
planet. And there's no solution for any country in isolation from what happens in the rest
of the world. No such solution exists. But we're working hard.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We're very pleased with Samper's visit.
He's been very decent toward our country-respectful, friendly- and he'll be welcomed with
all honors, as I said. I think that it will be useful for us to know his opinions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are familiar with many points of view of
Colombians from different political trends. Different personalities visit us. You should
not think that the only ones we talk to are those reported by the newspapers. I devote
quite a lot of time to talking to many people who don't appear in the press. I'm not in
the papers very often and, when I am, it's your fault for always keeping watch on me,
chasing after me, forcing me to speak. (<i>Laughter.</i>)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What will I do with myself and the
appointments I have today?</font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A short question, Commander. I know it's
completely out of place, but it's to ask you your personal opinion about a mutual friend,
a friend that you and I have in common-Silvio Rodríguez.What do you think of Silvio?</font></p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">I think that question is very badly put,
because that's not something you should ask. I consider Silvio to be one of our most
distinguished and upright intellectuals and artists. I'm his friend and I'm
extraordinarily fond of him. I feel proud that our country has men like Silvio.</font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thank you very much. (Applause and
exclamations of &quot;Long live the Commander-in-Chief!&quot; and &quot;Long live the
revolution!&quot;)</font></p>
