<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>SPEECH BY COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF FIDEL
CASTRO AT THE SPECIAL SESSION COMMEMORATING THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF THE WORLD HEALTH
ORGANIZATION. Palais des Nations, Geneva, Switzerland. May 14, 1998</strong></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Excellencies,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">World Health Organization officials,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Distinguished delegates,</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The World Health Organization deserves
honor because together with UNICEF it has assisted in saving the lives of hundreds of
million children and millions of mothers, and it has relieved the suffering of, and saved
from death, many more million human beings! These two agencies together with FAO, UNDP,
UNCTAD, the WFP, the World Population Fund, UNESCO and others - so resisted by those who
would like to obliterate from Earth the noble ideas that inspired the establishment of the
United Nations - have decidedly contributed to the creation of a universal awareness on
the grave problems affecting the world today and the great challenges still ahead.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">If the world economy has grown six times,
according to estimates by prestigious analysts, and the production of goods and services
has climbed from less than 5 trillion dollars to over 29 trillion between 1950 and 1997,
why do 12 million children under 5 years of age still die every year, that is, 33 thousand
a day when the overwhelming majority could be saved? Nowhere in the world, neither in
genocide nor war are so many people killed by the minute, by the hour, by the day as are
killed by hunger and poverty in our planet, 53 years after the United Nations was founded.
</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Almost a hundred percent of the dying
children whose lives could be saved are poor and among those who survive, why are 500
thousand blinded every year for lack of a simple vitamin whose cost, in a year, is lower
than a packet of cigarettes? Why are 200 million children under 5 years of age
undernourished? Why do 250 million children and adolescents work? Why is it that 110
million do not attend grammar school and 275 million fail to attend junior high school?
Why are 2 million girls dragged to prostitution every year?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Why is it that in a world producing almost
30 trillion dollars a year in goods and services, 1.3 billion human beings live in
absolute poverty? Why are they receiving less than a dollar a day per capita when others
receive over a million dollars daily? Why is it that 800 million people cannot have access
to the most basic health services? Why is it that of the 50 million people, children and
adults, who die in the world every year 17 million - that is, about 50 thousand a day -
are the victims of mostly curable infectious diseases, many of them preventable, at a cost
sometimes lower than a dollar?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">What is the price of a human life? This
unfair and unbearable economic order that prevails in the world, how much is it costing
mankind?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Five hundred and eighty five thousand women
died in 1996 during pregnancy or delivery, over 99 percent of them in the Third World; 70
thousand died of abortions performed in unsuitable conditions, 69 thousand of them in
Latin America, Africa and Asia.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Aside from the vast difference in the
quality of life, people in the rich countries live, as an average, 12 more years than in
the poor countries and in certain nations the difference between the richest and the
poorest is 20 to 35 years.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It's really sad to see that despite efforts
by the WHO and UNICEF in the last 50 years, only in the mother-child segment of the
population over 600 million children and 25 million mothers who could have survived were
dead for lack of medical care. But, that would have required a more rational world with
more justice. In that same post-war period over 30 trillion dollars were invested in the
military field. According to United Nations estimates, the cost of universal access to
basic health care services would be 25 billion dollars a year, that is, 3 percent of the
800 billion dollars presently destined for military expenses. And the cold war is over.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The arms trade - arms for killing - goes on
while medicines, that should be made to save lives, are sold at increasingly higher
prices. In 1995, the market of pharma-ceuticals involved 280 billion dollars. The
developed countries with 824 million people, 14.6 percent of the world population, consume
82 percent of the medicines while consumption in the rest of the world with a 4,815
million population is only 18 percent. The prices are actually prohibitive for the Third
World where consumption is limited to the privileged sectors. The control of patents and
markets by the big transnational companies allows them to raise prices over ten times
above production costs. The market price of some advanced antibiotics is 50 times higher
than their cost.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">But mankind continues to grow. We are
already close to 6 billion. We are growing at a pace of 80 millions annually. It took 2
million years to grow to the first billion people; 100 years to the second billion; 11
years to the last few billions. In 50 more years there will be 4 billion new people on the
planet.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Old diseases are reemerging and new ones
are coming up: AIDS, ebola, hantavirus, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, over 30 of them
according to experts. Either we defeat AIDS or AIDS will ruin many Third World countries.
No poor patient can afford the 10,000 dollars cost, per person per year, of the existing
treatments that prolong life but do not cure the disease.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The climate is changing, the oceans and the
atmosphere are warmer, the air and waters are contaminated, the soils keep eroding, the
desserts are expanding, the forests are dying, water is in short supply. Who will save our
species? Perhaps the blind and uncontrollable market laws, the neo-liberalization going
global, an economy growing by itself and for itself as a cancer devouring man and
destroying nature? That cannot be the way, or it will only be for a very short period of
history.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">It is against such realities that the World
Health Organization is heroically fighting and it is, indeed, its duty to be optimistic. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">As a Cuban and a revolutionary I share that
optimism. Cuba, with an infant mortality rate of 7.2 per one thousand live-births in the
first year of life, a physician to 176 people - the highest ratio in the world - and a
life expectancy beyond 75 years, reached in 1983 the goals set by the Health for All
Program in the Year 2000, despite the cruel blockade it has been enduring for over 40
years and its condition as a poor Third World country. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The attempt to carry out a genocide against
our people has led to the multiplication of our strengths and our will to survive. The
world can also fight and win!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Thank you very much.</font></p>
