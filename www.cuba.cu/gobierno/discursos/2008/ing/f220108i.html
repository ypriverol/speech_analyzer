a militant leftist Sandinista and, today, an adversary of Daniel. The two

that I perceived in Father Ernesto <span class=SpellE>Cardenal</span>, unlike

with Lula?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>A lot.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was never a left-wing extremist, nor did
he become a revolutionary through philosophical studies but rather he came from
very humble working class roots and Christian beliefs, and he worked hard
creating surplus value for others.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Karl
Marx saw the workers as the ones who would bury the capitalist system:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Workers of the world unite,” he
proclaimed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He presents us with reasons
and demonstrates this with irrefutable logic; he takes pleasure and makes fun
of the cynical lies used to accuse Communists.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If the ideas of Marx were just at that time, when everything seemed to
depend on the class struggle and the growth of the productive forces, science
and technology, that supported the creation of essential goods to satisfy human
necessities, there are absolutely new factors which say that he was right and
which at the same time clash with his noble aims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB

exploiters nor exploited. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Among these
new necessities we have that of human survival.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>No one had even heard about climate change in Marx’s day and age.<span

surely knew that one day the sun would be extinguished as it consumed all of
its energy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few years after the Manifesto
was written, other men were born who made inroads in science and knowledge
about the laws of chemistry, physics and biology ruling the Universe and
unknown then.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Into whose hands would
this knowledge fall?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although it
continues in its development and even improves, and again partially denies and
contradicts its own theories, new knowledge is not in the hands of the poor
nations who today make up three-quarters of the world’s population.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is in the hands of a privileged group of
wealthy and developed capitalist powers, associated with the most powerful
empire ever to exist, built on the bases of a globalized economy, governed by
the very laws of capitalism described by Marx and thoroughly studied by
him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

historical dates on the days corresponding to anniversaries that commemorate
years ending in a five or a zero.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
is fair, but we must be careful, in the sum-total of so many occurrences
described in each newspaper or article, according to their criteria, lest we
lose sight of them in the context of the historical development of our
