<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Distinguished
participants in the International Conference for World Balance, held in honor
of the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the birth of José <span class=SpellE>Martí</span>;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Esteemed guests;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Fellow Cubans:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>What does <span
class=SpellE>Martí</span> mean to Cubans?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>When he was
barely 18 years old, <span class=SpellE>Martí</span> wrote a document entitled
&quot;Political Prison in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>&quot;,
after his own experience of being cruelly imprisoned, with his feet shackled,
at the age of 16. In it, he declares, &quot;God exists, however, in the idea of
good, which watches over the birth of every being, and leaves in the soul that
embodies it a pure tear. The good is God. The tear is the source of eternal
feeling.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>For us Cubans, <span
class=SpellE>Martí</span> is the idea of good that he described.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Those of us who
resumed the fight for independence first initiated on October 10, 1868 on July
26, 1953, precisely 100 years after the birth of <span class=SpellE>Martí</span>,
had learned from him, above all else, the ethical principles without which a
revolution cannot even be conceived. From him we also learned his inspirational
patriotism and a higher concept of honor and human dignity than anyone in
history could have ever taught us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>He was a truly
extraordinary and exceptional individual. The son of a military man, born into
the home of a Spanish father and mother, he grew into a prophet and forger of
the independence of the land of his birth; an intellectual and poet, still an
adolescent when the first great battle broke out, he was later able to conquer
the hearts, the following, the support and the respect of old and experienced
military leaders who had covered themselves in glory in that first war. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>A fervent lover
of peace, unity and harmony among men, he did not waver in organizing and
initiating the just and necessary war against colonialism, slavery and
injustice. His blood was the first to be spilled and his life was the first to
be offered up as an indelible symbol of altruism and self-sacrifice. For many
years, he remained forgotten and unknown to a large part of the people for
whose independence he had fought. But his immortal ideas rose up from his
ashes, like the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Phoenix</st1:place></st1:City>,
so that almost half a century after his death, an entire people took up a
colossal battle, confronting the most powerful enemy any large or small country
had ever faced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Today, a few
hours after the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of his birth, hundreds of
brilliant thinkers and intellectuals from throughout the world have rendered
him an emotional tribute with the profound recognition deserved by his life and
work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Beyond <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>, what did
he give to the world? <span class=GramE>An exceptional example of a creator and
humanist worthy of being remembered throughout the centuries.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Why, and whom to?
To those who are struggling today, and those who will struggle tomorrow, for
the same dreams and hopes of saving the world; and because as fate would have
it, humanity today has awoken to the dangers that he foresaw and warned of
through his profound vision and inspired genius. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The day on which
he fell, May 19, 1895, <span class=SpellE>Martí</span> was sacrificing his own
life for the right to life of all the inhabitants of the planet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>In his now famous
unfinished letter to his close friend Manuel Mercado, which <span class=SpellE>Martí</span>
interrupted to march off to an unexpected battle, a battle that no one could
keep him from, <span class=SpellE>Martí</span> left recorded for history his
innermost thoughts. And although they are so often repeated and thus so well
known, I will nevertheless repeat them once again: &quot;I am in daily danger
of giving my life for my country and duty, for I understand that duty and have
the courage to carry it out – the duty of preventing the United States from
spreading through the Antilles as Cuba gains its independence, and from
overpowering with that additional strength our lands of America. All I have
done so far, and all I will do, is for this purpose.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Weeks earlier, in
Santo Domingo, <span class=SpellE>Martí</span> had signed the <span
class=SpellE>Montecristi</span> Manifesto alongside that exemplary Latin
American patriot <span class=SpellE>Máximo</span> <span class=SpellE>Gómez</span>,
a native of the Dominican Republic chosen by <span class=SpellE>Martí</span> to
serve as military leader of the Cuban forces. At that moment, shortly before
setting off for Cuba, <span class=SpellE>Martí</span> expressed, among many
other brilliant revolutionary ideas, something so admirable that I feel the
need to repeat it, at the risk of becoming tedious: &quot;The Cuban
independence war (...) is an event of great human significance and timely
service which the judicious heroism of the Antilles lends to stability and fair
treatment among the American nations and to the still uncertain balance in the
world.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>What foresight is
reflected in this last phrase, which has become the central theme of this <span
class=GramE>conference.</span> There is nothing more necessary and vital today
than that distant and seemingly utopian balance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>One hundred and
six years, four months and two days after José <span class=SpellE>Martí’s</span>
letter to Manuel Mercado, and 106 years, five months and 26 days after <span
class=SpellE>Martí</span> and <span class=SpellE>Gómez</span> signed the <span
class=SpellE>Montecristi</span> Manifesto, the president of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
in a speech to that country’s Congress on September 20, 2001, made the
following statement:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;We will
[use] every necessary weapon of war.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;Americans
should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have
ever seen.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;Every
nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or
you are with the terrorists.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;I’ve called
the Armed Forces to alert, and there is a reason. The hour is coming when <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> will
act, and you will make us proud.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;This is
civilization’s fight.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;The great
achievement of our time, and the great hope of every time – now depends on
us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;The course
of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. [...] And we know
that God is not neutral.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>In a speech made
on June 1, 2002, on the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">West
 Point</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Military</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Academy</st1:PlaceType>, the president of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
among other things, declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;In the
world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of action. And this
nation will act.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;Our
security will require transforming the military you will lead – a military that
must be ready to strike at a moment’s notice in any dark corner of the world
[...] ready for preemptive action when necessary to defend our liberty and to
defend our lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;We must
uncover terror cells in 60 or more countries.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;We will
send diplomats where they are needed, and we will send you, our soldiers where
you’re needed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;We are in a
conflict between good and evil... we do not create a problem, we reveal a
problem. And we will lead the world in opposing it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>I wonder what
thoughts would have flashed, at the speed of light, through the brilliant mind
of a man like <span class=SpellE>Martí</span>, wounding him deep in his soul,
had he been around to hear these words in a world now inhabited by over 6.4
billion human beings, all of whom, for one reason or another, from the
super-rich to the super-poor, are facing a grave threat to their very survival.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>It was not a
madman who spoke these words from the dark corner of an insane asylum. They are
backed by tens of thousands of nuclear weapons; millions of bombs and warheads;
tens of thousands of precision guided missiles; thousands of bombers and
fighter planes, manned and unmanned; dozens of naval squadrons and detachments
with aircraft carriers and nuclear and conventionally powered submarines;
military bases, held with and without consent, in every corner of the world;
military satellites that spy over every square kilometer of the planet; secure
and instant communications systems, capable of wiping out the communications of
any other country and simultaneously intercepting billions of conversations;
fabulous arsenals of chemical and biological weapons; and a military spending
budget of close to 400 billion dollars, which could be used to confront and
resolve many of the world’s most pressing problems. It was the man who controls
and can order the use of all these means who made the threats contained in the
statements quoted above. <span class=GramE>The justification?</span> <span
class=GramE>The brutal terrorist attack of September 11, which cost the lives
of thousands of people in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</span> The entire world joined in
solidarity with the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
people and indignantly condemned the attack. With the unanimous support of
world opinion, the scourge of terrorism could be confronted from every angle
and all political and religious currents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The battle, as <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>
maintained, had to be fundamentally political and ethical, in the interests and
with the support of all of the peoples of the world. Nobody could conceive of
the idea of confronting absurd, discredited and unpopular terrorist strategies
that hurt innocent people, implemented by individuals, groups, organizations,
and even some states or governments, by fighting back with brutal state
terrorism on a global scale, with one superpower claiming the right to the
possible extermination of entire nations, and perhaps even resorting to the use
of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>At this very
moment, as we commemorate the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the birth of José
<span class=SpellE>Martí</span>, quite possibly the first person in history to
put forward the concept of world balance, a war is about to break out as a
consequence of the most colossal imbalance in military power ever seen on this
Earth. Yesterday marked the deadline issued by the most formidable power in the
world for the use of its unilateral right to unleash its arsenal of the most
sophisticated weapons in existence against another nation. And it would do so
with or without the authorization of the United Nations Security Council, an
institution that is in itself questioned owing to the existence of veto power,
the exclusive prerogative of five countries that are permanent members, and the
resulting negation of the most basic democratic principles for the remaining
almost 200 states represented in the United Nations General Assembly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>It is precisely
the government that today proclaims its right to go over the head of this
Council that has most often exercised the privilege of veto power. Seldom used
by the other five, the radical changes in the balance of military power among
its members over the last 12 years will make it almost impossible for this
prerogative to be used against the wishes of one so powerful not only because
of its overwhelming military force, but its economic, political and
technological might as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The vast majority
of world opinion is opposed to this announced war. But what is most important
is that according to recent surveys, up to 65% of Americans oppose an attack
without the approval of the Security Council. This does not, however,
constitute an insurmountable obstacle: now that the troops have been sent and
are ready for action, and the most sophisticated weapons need to be tested, it
is highly unlikely that war will not break out, if the authorities of the
country threatened with extermination do not comply with all of the demands of
those threatening them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>No one can know
or predict what will happen in any war or similar situation. The only thing one
can say for certain is that the threat of a war in Iraq has weighed down
considerably on the world economy, currently facing a grave and profound crisis
which, combined with the fascist coup against the Bolivarian government of
Venezuela, one of the world’s largest oil exporters, has raised the prices of
this vital commodity to intolerable levels for the vast majority of the other
countries, especially the poorest, before a single shot has even been fired in
Iraq. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>It is already
generally accepted that the purpose of the war in Iraq is to take possession of
the world’s third largest reserve of oil and gas, something that greatly
concerns almost all of the other developed countries, such as those of Europe,
which import 80% of their energy, as opposed to the United States, which
currently imports barely 20% to 25% of the energy it consumes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Yesterday,
January 28, at 9:00 p.m., the president of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> declared to the U.S.
Congress:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;The <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> will ask the UN Security Council
to convene on February 5 to consider the facts of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s ongoing defiance of the
world.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;We will
consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully
disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the <span
class=GramE>world,</span> we will lead a coalition to disarm him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&quot;And if war
is forced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
military.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>He does not say a
word about prior approval by the Security Council. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>If we move away
for the moment from the terrible consequences of a war in that region, which
the world’s sole superpower could impose at its will, the imbalance suffered by
the world today in economic terms is an equally enormous tragedy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Differences
related to the rich and poor countries, both between them and within them, have
grown and deepened; in other words, there is an ever wider gap in the
distribution of wealth, the greatest scourge of our era, resulting in poverty,
hunger, ignorance, disease and unbearable pain and suffering for countless
human beings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Why do we not
dare to declare that there can be no democracy, free choice or real freedom in
the midst of such horrific inequalities, ignorance, total or functional
illiteracy, poor education and overwhelming lack of political, economic,
scientific and artistic knowledge, accessible only for a tiny minority, even in
developed countries, while the world is inundated with a trillion dollars worth
of commercial advertising, pushing consumption and poisoning the masses with
frustrated desires of unattainable dreams and aspirations, creating waste,
alienation, and the implacable destruction of the natural conditions essential
for human life? In barely a century and a half from now we will have used up
all of the available energy resources and the known and potential reserves that
it took nature 300 million years to create, without a viable substitute
anywhere in sight. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>What do the
masses know about the complex economic problems facing the world today? Who has
taught them what the International Monetary Fund is, or the World Bank, the
WTO, and other similar institutions? Who has explained to them the economic
crises, their causes and consequences? Who has told them that capitalism, free
enterprise and free competition barely even exist anymore, and that 500 big
transnational companies control 80% of world production and trade? Who has
taught them about the stock market, the growing speculation with the
commodities that the <st1:place w:st="on">Third World</st1:place> countries
depend on and the buying and selling of currencies, totaling trillions of
dollars daily? Who has informed them that the Third World currencies are pieces
of paper that constantly decrease in value, while their reserves of real or
almost real money flee inexorably to the wealthiest countries, like Newton’s
law of gravitation, and who has told them of the terrible material and social
consequences of this reality? Or why we owe trillions of dollars that can never
be paid or collected, while tens of millions of people, including children between
the ages of 0 and 5, die of hunger and curable diseases every year? How many
know that the sovereignty of states hardly even exists anymore, thanks to
treaties that are drafted without absolutely <span class=GramE>no</span>
participation by the <st1:place w:st="on">Third World</st1:place> countries,
and yet are used to keep us ever more exploited and subjugated? How many are
aware that our national cultures are being increasingly destroyed?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The list of
questions would be endless. I will pose just one more to those who live off of
hypocrisy and lies about the most sacred rights of all human beings, all of the
world’s peoples, and humanity itself as a whole: Why not erect a living
monument to the beautiful and profound truth contained in <span class=SpellE>Martí’s</span>
maxim, &quot;To be educated is the only way to be free&quot;?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>I say this on behalf
of a people that has unwaveringly resisted for more than four decades under a
rigorous blockade and relentless economic war, compounded by the loss of almost
all its foreign markets, trade and supplies after the collapse of the socialist
bloc and the USSR, and which stands today as one of the most united, socially
developed peoples in the world, with one of the highest degrees of basic
knowledge, political awareness, and artistic culture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>If we have
succeeded in some way in honoring the hero whose fruitful birth we are
commemorating today, it is by having demonstrated that a small and poor
country, despite inevitable errors committed in its learning process, can do
much with very little.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The Cuban
people’s greatest monument to his memory is having built and defended this
trench, so that no one could overpower with that additional strength our lands
of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Americas</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>From him, we
learned the infinite value and power of ideas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The economic
order imposed on humanity by our powerful neighbor to the north is
unsustainable and unendurable. The most sophisticated weapons can do nothing to
impede the course of history.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Those who for
centuries have supplied and continue to supply surplus value and cheap labor
now number in the billions. They cannot be exterminated like flies. They are
becoming increasingly aware of the injustices inflicted on them, through the
hunger, suffering and humiliation they endure as human beings, rather than
through the schools and education denied to them, and despite the worn-out lies
with which the monopolistic use and abuse of the mass media attempts to
maintain them in eternal and impossible submission. They have been given
eloquent lessons in rather recent times, such as those of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Iran</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Ecuador</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Argentina</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Without
firing a single shot, without even having a weapon to fire, the masses can wipe
out governments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>There are ever
fewer soldiers of national armies willing to shoot and massacre their own
compatriots. The world cannot be governed with a foreign soldier carrying a
rifle, helmet and bayonet in every factory, every school, every park, <span
class=GramE>every</span> community, large or small.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>A growing number
of intellectuals, educated workers, professionals and members of the middle
classes of the developed countries are joining the struggle to save humanity
from the relentless wars against the peoples and against nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Throughout
history, it has been demonstrated that great crises give rise to great
solutions, and that great leaders have arisen in and from these crises. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Let no one
believe that individuals make history. Subjective factors have an influence,
and historical processes can be speeded up when individuals have the right
ideas, or set back when they are wrong, but they do not determine the final
outcome. Not even a man as brilliant as <span class=SpellE>Martí</span> –or we
could also mention <span class=SpellE>Bolívar</span>, <st1:City w:st="on">Sucre</st1:City>,
<span class=SpellE>Juárez</span>, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:place></st1:City>,
and many other admirable men like them– would be remembered by history if he
had been born, for example, 30 years earlier or later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>In the case of
Cuba, if our national hero had been born in 1823 and turned 30 in 1853, in the
midst of a slavery-based and annexationist society owning large plantations and
enormous masses of slaves, and without the existence yet of the powerful
national and patriotic sentiments forged by the glorious precursors who
initiated our first war of independence in 1868, then he would not have been
able to play a major role in the history of our country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>That is why I
firmly believe that the great battle will be fought on the battleground of
ideas, not of weapons, but without renouncing their use in cases like that of
our country or others in similar circumstances if a war is forced upon us,
because every force, every weapon, every strategy and every tactic has its
antithesis borne of the inexhaustible intelligence and awareness of those who
fight for a just cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>In the people of
the United States themselves, whom we have never viewed as our enemy, or blamed
for the threats and aggression we have suffered for more than 40 years, we can
see a friend and potential ally of the just causes of humanity, based on their
ethical roots. We saw this already during the war in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Viet Nam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. We saw it in something
that touched us as closely as the kidnapping of little <span class=SpellE>Elián</span>
<span class=SpellE>González</span>. We saw it in their support for the struggle
of Reverend Martin Luther King. We saw it in Seattle and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Quebec City</st1:place></st1:City>, where they fought alongside
Canadians, Latin Americans and Europeans against <span class=SpellE>neoliberal</span>
globalization. We have begun to see it again in their opposition to an
unnecessary war, without at least the approval of the Security Council. We will
see it tomorrow, as they join with the other peoples of the world to defend the
only path that can save the human species from the insanity of human beings
themselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>If I were to dare
to make a suggestion to the illustrious visitors gathered here, it would be
something that I can see you are already doing. Nevertheless, at the risk of
tiring you, I will allow myself to repeat and reiterate: in the face of the
sophisticated and destructive weapons with which they seek to intimidate and
subject us to an unjust , irrational and unsustainable social and economic
world order: Sow ideas! Sow ideas! And sow ideas! Build awareness! Build
awareness! And build awareness! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Thank you very
much. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
