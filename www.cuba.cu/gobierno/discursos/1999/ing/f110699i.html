<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Esteemed ministers and culture leaders in
the countries of Latin America or</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ibero-America,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Distinguished guests,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dear delegates to the first International
Congress on Culture and Development,</font>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">During four days those of you who took part
in the Congress have worked hard. Happily, your efforts coincided with
the ministers’ and culture leaders’ two-days meeting --on the 10<sup>th</sup>
and 11<sup>th</sup>-- preceding the Ibero-American Summit conference to
be held in the month of November. We have tried to be informed of what
you have discussed and what the debates have been like.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It seems to me that the organizers are
satisfied with the results of both meetings.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Among the subjects discussed --and undoubtedly
there were many and of great value-- some caught my particular attention.
I find they are among the subjects related to culture and politics that
I mostly appreciate. For example, the need for states to promote a correct
policy of environmental education; the importance of history to convey
values and defend the peoples’ identity; the need to reject colonialist
or hegemonic models; the advisability of avoiding damages to the national
identity from tourism; the necessity to meditate on the current world,
to build a public awareness and to transmit ideas which I consider of basic
importance; the urgent need to foster a true revolution of man’s ethic
through his education and the implementation of the right cultural policies.
This is really the first time that I see this last subject so clearly formulated.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, there is an item 12, which I do
not know if absolutely everybody will agree with but at least I do, and
it reads: "The capitalist economy cannot guarantee the prospective development
of humanity because it does not take into account the cultural and human
losses that result from its own expansion". I would go a little bit further
and say that not only does it not guarantee the prospective development
of humanity but that, as a system, it puts at risk its very existence.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">You urged me to say a few words the day
that the Congress opened and I touched on an essential point related to
the transfer of ideas.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not know how much discussion there
has been on the ways to implement that principle. I do know, however, that
as a fundamental part of the integration policy that is up for debate you
have raised the need for culture to be given a priority over the other
objectives of that integration.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We feel that, united we would be worth
the sum of many and very rich cultures. In this token, when we think about
Our Americas, as [Jos&eacute;] Mart&iacute; called it, the Americas down
from the R&iacute;o Bravo [R&iacute;o Grande] --although it should have
been from the Canadian border because that portion also belonged to our
Americas until an insatiable expansionist neighbor seized the whole territory
of the west of what is today the United States of America-- it is that
integration which I have in mind, but including the Caribbean nations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Caribbean nations are still not present
in these Ibero-American Summit conferences. Fortunately, all Latin American
and Caribbean countries will, for the first time, meet with the European
Union in R&iacute;o de Janeiro on the 28th and 29th of this month. So,
the family is already growing although, in general, the Caribbean nations
have been the last of the forgotten as we, Latin Americans, also were and
still are forgotten.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The sum of all our cultures would make
up one enormous culture and be a multiplication of our cultures. Integration
should not adversely affect, but rather enrich, the culture of everyone
of our countries.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In this context, when we talk about unity
we still do so in a narrow framework. But I like to go beyond that. I believe
in the unity of all the countries in the world, in the unity of all the
peoples in the world and in a free unity, a truly free unity. I am not
thinking of a fusion but of a free unity of all cultures in a truly just
world, in a truly democratic world, in a world where it would be possible
to apply the kind of globalization that Karl Marx talked about in his time
and that [Pope] John Paul II talks about today when he speaks of the globalization
of solidarity.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We still need a good definition of what
the globalization of solidarity means. If we take this thought to its final
consequences we will realize that item 12 is a reality because I wonder
if the capitalist system can guarantee the globalization of solidarity.
No one speaks about the "globalization of charity", which would be very
good in the meantime, but let us hope the day will come when charity is
unnecessary. That will be the day when the sentiments of solidarity become
universal and the spirit of solidarity goes global.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I say this to make it clear that I am in
no way a narrow nationalist or a chauvinist. I hold man in a higher concept
and cherish more ambitious dreams for the future of the human species,
which has gone through so much hardship to end up being what it is today,
and accumulated such knowledge as it has today, while still not deserving
the description of a truly human species. What we presently have is still
very far from that but, perhaps, the further it seems, the closer it actually
is, since this humanity is going through a colossal crisis and it is only
from colossal crises that great solutions may come.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is what history has been teaching
us so far, up to this very moment when the real globalization, which was
not even mentioned a few years ago, has been made possible and inevitable
by the enormous advances in science, technology and communications. People
communicate with one another in a matter of seconds, wherever they are.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Suffice it to say that it is more difficult
for me to communicate with our minister of Foreign Affairs here than with
our ambassador in the United Nations. The ambassador there has a cellular
phone and even if he is in the meeting room beside his colleague, the U.S.
ambassador --with an empty seat between them-- he can talk over the phone.
Just today, when the phone connection was made and I asked where he was
--whether in the mission, at home or in the United Nations-- he said: "I
am in the car." I said: "In the car! But I hear you so well!" He said:
"Yes, we have stopped at the traffic light now." And we continued talking
for several more minutes. It is incredible, really.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Technological advances explain the accuracy
of the famous satellites guiding the missiles and the smart weapons which
are not so smart that they do not fail disturbingly often, that is, if
they actually fail unintentionally.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The incident with the Chinese embassy [in
Belgrade] seemed so strange, so bizarre; then in trying to explain it they
said the problem was that they had been bombing guided by some old outdated
maps. So, due to some outdated maps a bomb could have fallen here too,
in this meeting room.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Money moves rapidly, too, and speculative
operations with currencies are carried out at great speed for a trillion
dollars every day; and they are not the only speculative operations taking
place, nor is it only with currencies they speculate.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the time of Maghellan, it took I do
not know how many months to go round the world and now it can be done in
barely 24 hours.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Me too, I went round the world not long
ago, stopping off in Denmark, China, Vietnam, Japan, Canada and back to
Havana. I then began playing with the numbers and doing some calculations
and I realized that flying East, on a faster plane than mine, it is possible
to leave China early on Monday morning and arrive in Havana on Sunday afternoon.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have seen the world change in a few
decades.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you do not mind I will introduce an
issue, just like you have introduced many others, and I would call it <i>Culture
and Sovereignty</i>.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will rely on concrete facts and I am
not talking theory or philosophy but things that we can all see, that even
a near-sighted person can see: namely, that there can be no culture without
sovereignty. [Minister of Culture] Abel [Prieto] outlined how a handful
of brilliant personalities succeeded in saving the national culture from
American neocolonialism and hegemonism in Cuba.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another country has more merit than we
do: Puerto Rico, which has been a Yankee colony for 100 years now but where
neither their language nor culture have been destroyed. It is admirable!
(Applause)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Of course, imperialism has today much more
powerful means to destroy cultures, to impose other cultures and homogenize
cultures --much more powerful means. Perhaps, at this moment, it can be
more influential in 10 years than it was in the past 100 years. However,
the example I gave you sheds some light on the peoples’ capacity to resist
and on the value of culture. The Puerto Ricans were deprived of all sovereignty
and, despite everything, they have resisted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although it is possible to find examples
to show that there can be culture, or that a certain degree of culture
can be preserved without sovereignty, what is inconceivable or unimaginable
in today’s world and toward the future is the existence of sovereignty
without culture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">While you, Congress delegates, ministers
and government leaders of culture in Ibero-America were here yesterday
involved in your debates, a great battle was being fought at the United
Nations for sovereignty and we would say a major battle for culture, too.
Yes, because I say that, today, the means in the hands of those who dominate
the world economically and almost politically are much more powerful than
they ever were.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That great battle had to do with the Security
Council meeting which discussed a draft resolution on the war unleashed
against Yugoslavia, basically against Serbia. In my view, it was a historic
battle because imperialism and its allies --or better still, imperialism
and those who support it against their own best interests-- are waging
a massive struggle against the principle of sovereignty, an awesome offensive
against sovereignty.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We could see this coming. After the collapse
of the socialist camp, the USSR disintegrated and a single superpower remained
in the world. It was noticeable that that superpower --of well known origins
whose diabolical methods and principles are also very well known-- could
not refrain from trying to use all its vast power to impose its standards
and its interests on the world, carefully at first and then by increasingly
stark means.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are already looking at an imperialism
that is using all its might and force to sweep away anything that stands
in its way and culture is one of those things very much in its way. They
are the owners of the vast majority of the communication networks, that
is, 60 percent of the world communication networks and of the most powerful
and unrivalled television channels. And, they have the almost absolute
monopoly of the films shown in the world.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It can be said that France, which is fighting
an almost heroic battle to preserve its culture as much as possible against
the United States cultural invasion, is the only country in Europe, that
I know of, where the American films shown account for less than 50 percent
of the total. In the other countries of the Old Continent, it is above
50 percent. In some of them it can be 60, 65, 70 and even 80 percent. As
for television series, it is 60, 70, 80 and 90 percent, so that about 70
percent of the television series shown and 75 percent of the video cassettes
distributed are from the United States; these figures that you must have
heard before. Ramonet [a French journalist] writes about those figures.
It is an almost absolute monopoly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are major Latin American countries
where 90 percent of the films and series shown come from the United States
and you know the characteristics of what comes there. Very little material
comes from Europe, so in those aspects there is a total cultural colonization
by the United States.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It goes without saying that, in our case,
it is extremely difficult to find films of some moral and cultural value.
How do we escape from films that show violence, sex and the Mafia almost
exclusively? How do we escape from so many alienating and poisonous films
that they distribute throughout the world? It becomes difficult for us,
for our television practically without commercials, as I said to you, to
find films to show on weekends; and people are often critical of what is
shown. On the other hand, they are copies because we should say, in all
sincerity, that as we were blockaded and all our imports prevented we found
ourselves forced to copy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some things are easy to copy, including
films, and I think that the comrades in our prestigious ICAIC [Cuban Films
Institute] in the early years --and rightly so, it is a historical merit--
specialized in copying U.S. films. Then, there were some good ones, I mean,
in the past there used to be more good American and European films. They
were worth watching.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The commercial spirit has so pervasively
penetrated culture as to become overwhelming. Which country in Europe can
spend 300 million US dollars or more on a film? Which country in Europe
can make profits of $500 million, or even $1.2 billion trading on paraphernalia
related to a film? Those are companies that exploit everything, and the
sales of goods associated to an expensive and highly publicized film actually
give them higher profits than the screening of the film.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Actually, those films can cover all their
costs and produce high profits in the United States market alone. Therefore,
as you can easily understand, they can sell the films much more cheaply
anywhere in Europe or the world. Who can compete with them?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Still, those European countries, some of
them in a real cultural shock and others relatively indifferent to the
phenomenon, who with their unity and integration expect to develop their
economic, technological, scientific and cultural possibilities, --practically
as a necessity for survival-- even those countries support the imperialist
policy. They are supporting a policy aimed at sweeping away the principles
of sovereignty. And it is not the case of very small countries, small islands
or very poor underdeveloped nations whose per capita Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) is 200 or 300 US dollars a year, but rather countries whose per capita
GDP is 20, 25, 30 and even 40,000 US dollars.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They, of course, are giving up national
sovereignty to the extent that they are uniting, opening borders, applying
the free circulation of capital, of workers, of technicians and creating
common institutions that provide advantages only for the European countries.
The South countries must arrive in little boats and enter illegally.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those countries are giving up their national
currencies, and with good logic, in order to adopt a common currency. That
is different from adopting a foreign currency governed by the U.S. Federal
Reserve System which is tantamount to annexing the country to the United
States.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What would become of us, who have, at least,
demonstrated that it is possible to resist a double blockade and such a
difficult period as we have gone through during these years? How would
that have been possible without our own currency? To this I would add,
as in passing, that we have revalued our currency seven times. From 1994,
when one US dollar bought 150 pesos, to 1999 or the end of 1998 --let us
say almost five years; the whole of 1994 should be counted-- we have revalued
the currency seven times. Today, one US dollar can only buy about 20 pesos.
No country has done that, I tell you. None!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The formulas of the [International] Monetary
Fund, all the recipes that it imposes and that you know so well, where
do they lead? Sometimes, through privatization or savings the countries
are able to accumulate major reserves to protect their currency but then,
in a number of days or weeks, they lose everything. We have seen that happen
in a matter of days. We neither have nor need those enormous reserves.
Other countries have them and lose them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is only one country --one single
country in the world!-- that does not even need a reserve because it prints
the banknotes that circulate throughout the world; the country that, as
we have said on other occasions, first converted gold into paper by unilaterally
suspending the free conversion of its banknotes and which changed the gold
in its reserves for the paper currency that it printed --a currency accepted
by everybody for its equivalent value in gold. Later, then, it converted
the paper into gold, the miracle dreamed of by the alchemists of the Middle
Ages. In other words, they print a piece of paper that circulates as if
it were gold. I am explaining the phenomenon in a simple way although the
procedure is more complicated than that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They use Treasury bonds and apply different
mechanisms. But, in essence, the fact is they can afford it because they
print the currency that circulates worldwide, they print the banknotes
kept as a reserve in the banks of every country in the world. They print
the paper, they buy with it and the others keep the paper --a large part
of it, not all of it, of course. Therefore, they are the ones who print
the world's reserve currency.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is one of the reasons for the emergence
of the euro. Let us say that it is an attempt to survive against that privilege
and against that monetary power so that no speculator can come along and
do to any European country as they did to the United Kingdom, France, Spain
and others when their currencies were devalued after they fell prey of
enormous speculative operations. Actually, when some American megamillionaire
wolves get together, no country can resist their speculative attacks. The
pound sterling, a currency queen not so long ago, was brought to its knees
in a matter of days.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That can give you an idea of what I mean.
That country --well, there is hardly any need to say it-- is the United
States of America, the only one protected. Others, faced with the continuous
and incessant devaluations, crises, catastrophes and flights of capital,
in their desperation begin considering the idea of suppressing their national
currencies and adopting the US dollar which is governed by the United States
Federal Reserve.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now, could our country survive if we had
such a system? That is, if our currency were the US dollar and this country
blockaded and unable to acquire dollars were to buy the peasants' products
--chicken, eggs, mangoes-- in US dollars, could this country exist? Based
on what we have had to go through and what we have learned, we realize
that in our conditions, if we did not have our very modest peso, which
we have revalued, as I said, seven times, we would not have been able to
revalue in the slightest. Practically all the schools would have been closed
here while not a single one has been closed, and all the hospitals while
not a single one has been closed. On the contrary, in this special period,
we have increased the country's medical staff, especially the doctors working
in the community but also those working in the hospitals by a figure that
comes to approximately 30,000 new doctors. All this despite our great economic
difficulties, lack of resources and often even of medicines, although we
have the basic ones.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Today, a newspaper reported that in a central
province of the country, not in the capital but in Villa Clara, infant
mortality in children under one year was 3.9 for 1,000 live births. If
we consider Washington, the United States capital, for example, its infant
mortality rate is four or five times higher than in the Villa Clara province.
There is one area, the Bronx, where it is 20 for 1,000 live births and
other places in the United States where it is 30 for 1,000.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our national average of infant mortality
is lower than the United States national average by at least two or three
percentage points. They are at perhaps 10 or 11 and our hope this year
is to reduce it to 7 for 1,000. Last year, it was 7.1.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Needless to say that it is due to the efforts
made that not a single day-care center has been closed. Not a single family
doctor’s office has been closed. The number of doctor's offices has increased
by many thousands during the special period. We have been able to do this,
of course, because there is a revolution, there is a united people, there
is a spirit of sacrifice and there is an extensive political culture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When we speak about culture we do not forget
the political culture. It is one of the sectors whose development is badly
needed and which is very much lacking in the world. It is impossible to
believe or imagine that an average person in the United States has a higher
political culture than a Cuban or a European. I admit that Europeans have
a higher political culture than Americans but, in general, Europeans do
not have a higher political culture than Cubans. That is for sure. You
could even have a contest to compare the European average political knowledge
and the Cuban average, a contest between people who unfortunately live
alienated by millions of things and people who do not live like that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In our Latin American countries, sometimes
necessity and poverty help in the development of a political culture higher
than in those very rich countries that do not suffer the calamities that
we do. That is why, in the Latin American teachers’ Congresses held in
Cuba with thousands of teachers in attendance they constantly speak of
the horrors of the neoliberalization that cuts off their budgets; and,
in the medical Congresses they do likewise, as in the students Congresses
or any congress for that matter, because they see it every day and they
are conscious of it. Of course, awful things happen in Latin America that
have not been seen for quite some time in Europe where the unemployed enjoy
benefits that, according to some, allow them to vacation abroad for 15
days and more a year.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Where none of that exists, people suffer
much more. We have more fertile ground to become politically cultured.
In our case, we also have the experience accumulated by the country in
very difficult battles against imperial aggression and in very great difficulties;
and difficulties make good fighters.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But, all that notwithstanding, we could
have done none of what I am telling you if we did not have a national currency
that helps us to redistribute, and also many free services.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Of course, you compare it with the US dollar
and there comes the misleading formula of the exchange rate between the
US dollar and the Cuban peso in the <i>Exchange Bureaux</i>. And, if they
say that it is 20 to 1, then somebody earning 300 Cuban pesos is said to
earn 15 US dollars. If it was in New York, to those 15 US dollars you would
have to add 1,000 to 1,500 US dollars to pay the rent, another 500 to pay
for public health services --this is about 2,000 already-- another 500
or 1,000 for education, depending on the educational level because there
are university courses there that cost 30,000 dollars a year. The add some
750 dollars more for the free education given to children, adolescents
and young people here and the total could be some 2,750 US dollars, plus
15 that would be 2,765 dollars. All this is very misleading, is it not?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you take into account that all children
in Cuba up to the age of seven receive a liter of milk for 25 cents of
a Cuban peso, then this would be a child or a family that is paying only
1.3 [1.25] cents of a US dollar out of the supposed 15 US dollars, for
a liter of milk, and similarly for other essential food. Unfortunately,
there is not enough food but there is a certain amount that, measured in
dollars, are bought at a minute price.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you go to our stadium, you can watch
an important baseball match for 50 cents or one peso at most. If you go
to Baltimore, where our team played the US team, of the 45,000 fans there,
the ones who paid the least paid 10 US dollars and the ones who paid the
most paid 35. To watch a similar performance a hundred times, a Cuban pays
a maximum of 100 pesos. An American must pay 3,500 dollars. The same applies
to a lot of other activities and services. But our system, with all those
characteristics, could not have had such achievements without a national
currency.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Well, so far this long disquisition on
the importance of a national currency and the delirious things crossing
the minds of those considering the removal of the national currency.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There in Europe, when they talk about sovereignty,
they cannot have the same concept we do. They are uniting and giving up
many of the attributes of the nation state to a supranational state, to
a supranational community. Other countries elsewhere in the world should
do that and we, Latin Americans, should do that, too. If not, we will not
advance even three yards. In fact, we will go backwards more yards every
year if we do not integrate. In the light of what is happening in the world,
it is not something to preach but rather to build an awareness about, to
transmit a basic idea.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Actually, there is a very close powerful
neighbor who wants to integrate us into it. Of course, this is to have
access to our natural resources and the cheap labor of hundreds of millions
of Latin Americans producing jeans, shoes, T-shirts, handicrafts that are
very labor-intensive. Meanwhile, they keep the cutting-edge industries
and the brain drain continues. Right now, they are talking about hiring
200,000 highly qualified foreign workers for their electronic industries,
preferably Latin Americans. And so, they take away those highly qualified
people that you train in the universities, the most scientifically talented.
They give visas to them all right. These do not need to become wetbacks
or illegal immigrants.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If there is a good artist, an excellent
artist who can be exploited commercially, he is coaxed to go there. They
cannot coax a great writer like Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez because Garc&iacute;a
M&aacute;rquez might be coaxing them (Applause). At the very least with
the high value of his works he might take a substantial part of the banknotes
they print. Actually, a good writer can work in his own country, he does
not need to emigrate but in many areas of the arts it is not the same and
they are coaxing the best talents to go there; many of them, at least.
A man like Guayasam&iacute;n could not be bought, not with all the money
printed by the Federal Reserve. There are men who cannot be seduced with
any money, men and women --I rather add those two words than be accused
of gender discrimination-- and we have them here. We have them here! I
do not need to mention names, they are humble men and women who are worth
more than all the gold in the world. That is a fact.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am explaining all this because they can
help understand these phenomena of sovereignty, this battle. Because there
are so many lies, so much demagogy, so much confusion and so many methods
devised to disseminate them that an enormous effort should be made at constant
clarification. If some things are not understood, the rest cannot be understood.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They talk about flight of capital, about
volatile capital such as the short-term loans, as if those were the only
kind of volatile capital. In any Latin American country, the volatile capital
suddenly goes. But, alongside the volatile capital goes all the money saved
by the country's savers because if some people withdraw their money for
fear of a devaluation or so, the others rush to the bank, change it for
US currency and transfer it to the U.S. banks where the interest rate is
higher or lower, depending on the situation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So, all the Latin American and Caribbean
money is volatile capital. Let us be well aware of this. Volatile capital
is not limited to those short-term loans with a high interest rate that
are then quickly withdrawn by the owners when faced with a risky situation.
Any money can become volatile, except for Cuban money; there is no way
our money can become volatile. If they want to take it away we shall be
delighted. The liquidity would decrease and the value of the peso would
increase.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now the Europeans are uniting. They do
it to compete with their competitor. They talk about being partners but
the United States does not want to be anybody’s partner. At any rate, our
neighbor wants to be a privileged partner. It constantly takes measures
against Europe: banning the export of cheese for such a reason or other
or whatever other meat products because they use certain fodder. They are
always fabricating pretexts. Right now, because of the banana and a resolution
from the World Trade Organization which is nit unbiased, they have punished
European exports for a total of about 500 million dollars. They take measures
every day or threaten to take them. They are always wielding that weapon.
Indeed, it is very clear to anybody who does a little thinking that Europe
must compete very hard with them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We welcome this Caribbean and Latin American
meeting with the European Union that I previously mentioned. It is good
and it is convenient. I think that it is convenient for Europe, it is convenient
for the Caribbean and for Latin America as well. And let us hope that the
euro is strengthened. It has now dropped a little. It is enduring the consequences
of that adventurous and genocidal war --to call it by its true name.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It suits us that there is another reserve
currency, so that there are two and not just one in the world. If only
there were three. It suits us that there is more than one strong and stable
currency.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope that, among the many historical
acts of madness committed in this hemisphere we do not end up adopting
the US dollar as a circulation currency. It is a currency entirely managed
from the United States by the Federal Reserve and they are not going to
accept any Latin American representative there. Because if they were willing
to accept in their Federal Reserve System a representative for each Latin
American country, even we would send them one, if we were allowed to, of
course.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Obviously, that is a utopia. Of course,
they are not going to welcome anybody, not even from the richer and more
developed countries with a higher GDP, not even from Brazil, Argentina
or Mexico, to mention the largest fraternal countries of Latin America.
They are never going to accept our representatives in their Reserve System.
The Latin American and Caribbean destiny is in danger but everything is
not lost, far from it, we can still fight.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope you understand, European comrades,
that the concept of sovereignty cannot be the one openly and shamelessly
defended yesterday by a European representative for the first time since
ideas began to be debated and doctrines developed against sovereignty.
Europe, in general, is quite committed to that anti-sovereignty doctrine
promoted by the imperialism of the superpower.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This explains that a European country --whose
ambassador spoke at the United Nations in a way nobody had ever spoken
there-- could regard as anachronistic the United Nations Charter and the
principle of sovereignty and non-intervention, something fundamental in
international law. Those who so express themselves have practically renounced
sovereignty and will enjoy, in an near future, a simple national autonomy
within a supranational state, with a supranational parliament and a supranational
executive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Even now, as a reward for his glorious
wartime exploits and forgetting those who died and the millions who have
suffered and will keep those wounds for life, they have created the position
of European Minister of Foreign Affairs; a prize for an outstanding character
who seriously believes that he is what he is not and who acts like he really
is. I mean the great Marshall and Secretary General of NATO.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Do you not know who that is? Have you ever
heard of him? He was a minister of Culture in a European country. He is
Javier Solana. Did you know not that he was a minister of Culture? I met
him at an Ibero-American summit in Spain, he awaited me at the airport
and I chatted with him for a few minutes as protocol demands. He was at
the time a peaceful minister who actively participated in anti-NATO demonstrations.
Today, he is the Secretary General of NATO and a field Marshall. He must
really be at least a field Marshall to give orders to the American Generals.
Now, they are making him a sort of European foreign minister.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our comrades are asked by the press: Are
you not worried that they have named him Europe's minister of Foreign Affairs?
We, in fact, do not tend to worry about anything, nor do we exchange principles
for interests or convenience. But we might answer that we would rather
have him as a minister of Foreign Affairs than as a NATO field Marshall.
I do not know what his power will be as a minister of Foreign Affairs but
we know only too well the power that he claims as a NATO Secretary General.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have all the statements he has made,
both before and during the war, and I know few people as attached to the
doctrine of violence who use such a threatening style, with such a merciless
and tough language. Obviously, he has a very great responsibility which
he assumed when he formally ordered U.S. General [Wesley] Clark, head of
the NATO military forces in Europe, to start bombing at such and such an
hour and at such and such a point, after the NATO countries had given their
Secretary General the power to start the war when, in his view, the diplomatic
procedures had been exhausted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In his capacity as Secretary General he
issued orders and made statements almost constantly during more than 70
days of brutal bombings. They were all threatening, arrogant, abusive,
almost cynical statements. Then, after the Security Council’s meeting yesterday
he issued the last of his assumed orders: the cessation of the bombings.
All this with the corresponding theatrical overtones.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How obedient those American Generals! A
model of discipline such as history had never seen! They immediately attack
or they immediately cease to attack because a distinguished ex-minister
of Culture gives the order.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Can the countries of the European Union
have the same concept of sovereignty as Mexico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic
or any small Caribbean island, like a Central American country or like
Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Argentina or a south-east Asian
country like Indonesia, Malaysia or the Philippines? Can they have the
same concept as the vast majority of countries in the world which are dismembered?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When we are all integrated in a Latin America
and Caribbean union, our concept of sovereignty will be different. We will
have to give up a lot of those principles to obey the laws and the administration
or the decisions of a supranational state.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Moreover, a Marxist can never be a narrow
national chauvinist. A Marxist can be a patriot, which is different, and
love his or her homeland, which is different, too.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A long time before today, there were men
who dreamed, like [Sim&oacute;n] Bol&iacute;var almost 200 years ago, of
a united Latin America. There were men, like [Jos&eacute;] Mart&iacute;
who, more than 100 years ago dreamed of a united Latin America. At that
time, when Bol&iacute;var proclaimed his dreams, Latin America was not
made up of free independent countries, not yet.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In fact, the first independent country
following the United States of America was Haiti, a country that provided
material assistance to Bol&iacute;var in his struggle for Latin American
independence and which also contributed, with its ideas and exchanges,
to consolidate Bol&iacute;var’s consciousness about the impossibility to
defer the slaves emancipation which was not attained after the first triumphant
independence movement in Venezuela.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As you know, there was in the United States
a struggle for independence and a declaration of principles in 1776. But,
it was only after almost 90 years and a bloody war that the emancipation
of slaves was formally declared. Of course, the slaves situation was often
worse off afterwards since they were no longer any master’s property, they
were no longer their owners’ assets so, if they died, the former masters
did not lose a dime. Previously, if a slave died, his or her master lost
what the slave had cost him in the infamous auction. Later, as it was the
case here too, and everywhere, they were practically worse off.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In Latin America, slavery as a system disappeared
at a much earlier stage than in the United States. There were men who dreamed
about those things. There were men who, for the creation of a great, united
and strong republic dreamed that each of our current countries, without
renouncing their national sentiments, would lay down their prerogatives
or aspirations to the separate national independence of each of them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There were not even independent states
when Bol&iacute;var dreamed of a united, big and powerful Latin American
state based on our similarities, such as no other group of countries in
the world have in terms of language, ethnic groups of similar ancestry,
religious beliefs and general culture.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Religion is also a part of culture. When
we see the invasion of Latin America by fundamentalist sects --these things
are known, these ideas emerged during the cold war-- I wonder about this
invasion that wants to divide us into a thousand pieces. Why is there this
fundamentalist invasion, by hundreds, even thousands of religious denominations
that are not at all ecumenical, that are different from the traditional
Christian religious denominations which have an increasing ecumenical spirit?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When I was a student there was nothing
ecumenical about them. Really, when the Pope visited us, in my welcoming
speech, I praised the current ecumenical spirit of his church. I recalled
that it was not like that in my early youth, from first grade until I graduated
from high school when I studied in Catholic schools. As a rule, I was a
boarding student except for very short periods when I was a day pupil.
Relations among the traditional churches have changed a lot since then.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now I wonder, why do they want to fragment
us with this invasion of thousands of non-unitary sects? As we understand
it, in Latin America common religious beliefs constitute an important element
of culture, identity and integration. It is not that there has to be a
single church --far from it-- but pro-unity churches, ecumenical churches.
Such elements should be preserved.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We, Latin Americans, have many more things
in common than the Europeans. Until not long ago, for centuries, they were
warring against each other. There was one war that they called the Hundred
Years War, and wars of every kind: religious, national, ethnic wars. Those
who know a bit of history know that only too well.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Europeans have transcended all that
because they have become aware of the importance of unity. It must be said,
really, that the Europeans became conscious --their politicians, in general,
did-- of the need to unite and to integrate and for around 50 years they
have been working to that end. We have hardly even started.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The United Nations Charter and the principles
of sovereignty are absolutely indispensable and crucial for the vast majority
of peoples in the world, especially for the smallest and weakest who are
still not integrated into any strong supranational grouping in the current
stage of extraordinarily uneven political, economic and social development
of the human community.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The United States, captain and leader of
the doctrines fostered by NATO, wants to sweep away the foundations of
national sovereignty. It simply wants to take possession of the markets
and natural resources of the Third World countries including those that
were part of the former Soviet Union, like Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan
and others, while it is already almost the master of the great oil reserves
of the Caspian sea. It wants to play the role of a new Roman worldwide
super-empire which, of course, will last much less than the Roman Empire
and the reach of its ambitions and its clumsiness; and it will meet with
universal resistance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Nonetheless, it is preparing for the development,
consolidation and exercise of an boundless empire. Some American analysts
and writers from the same group as Ramonet --and Ramonet himself-- denounce
the cultural invasion, the almost total dominion over the mass media and
the cultural monopoly they are trying to impose on the world thus showing
the way the empire's most fervent theoreticians consider culture to be
the nuclear weapon of the 21st century. But, there is no need to be so
well informed to realize this. It can be seen clearly in everything they
do and in the way they do it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The empire's pretexts? Ah, humanitarian
reasons! Human rights is one of the reasons they give for which it is necessary
to liquidate sovereignty and internal conflicts that must be resolved with
"smart" bombs and missiles.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Whose proposal is this? Looking back, recalling
what happened in our hemisphere in the past few decades, who fathered all
the coups d'&eacute;tat? Who trained the torturers in the most sophisticated
techniques? Who was responsible for there being relatively small countries
where more than 100,000 persons were vanished and a total of about 150,000
were killed? Or the fact that, in other nations, tens of thousands of men
and women had a similar fate? I am talking here only about people who were
vanished after horrible torture. Who trained the sinister culprits? Who
armed them? Who supported them? How can they now claim that national sovereignty
must be removed in the name of human rights?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A few years ago, they killed four million
Vietnamese by dropping millions of tons of explosives on a country that
was 15,000 or 20,000 kilometers away. For a long time they kept fiercely
bombing with the result of four million people dead and a large number
disabled for life. Now, they are asking that sovereignty be removed in
the name of human rights.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In Angola, for example, who armed UNITA
which for more than 20 years massacred entire villages and killed hundreds
of thousands of Angolans? We know very well who did it because we were
there a long time supporting the Angolan people against the South African
racists. They are still killing there and their favorite leader has hundreds
of millions of US dollars in the banks --I do not know who launders the
money-- part of which is used to buy weapons, much to the pleasure of arms
manufacturers. He controls extensive areas that are very rich in diamonds
and has a personal fortune of hundreds of millions of US dollars.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Likewise, there has been no repressive
government in the world that the United States would not support. How could
the apartheid regime have seven nuclear weapons? They had seven when we
were there, on the Namibian border and, the United States intelligence
service, which knows everything, did not know about it! Did it not know?
And, how did those weapons get there? This is one question that could be
asked and one of the things that will be known in full detail one day when
some documents are declassified, because the day will come when absolutely
everything will be known.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One could also ask where those seven nuclear
weapons are because their manufacturers say they have been destroyed. That
is all that those of the apartheid regime would say. The ANC leaders do
not know. Nobody has answered that question. But, again, there are still
a lot of questions that have never been answered.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Who supported Mobutu [Sese Seko]? The United
States and Europe did. Where are the billions that Mobutu took from the
Congo? Which bank is keeping them? Who protected and looked after him or
inherited his immense fortune?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I could go on offering many similar examples.
Who supported the acts of aggression against the Arab countries? The United
States did.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am in absolutely no way an anti-Semite,
far from it. But, we have been very critical of the wars against the Arab
countries, the massive evictions, the diaspora of Palestinians and other
Arabs. Who supported those wars? And there are many other overt or covert
wars and other similar incidents that I am not going to mention which have
been done and continue to be done by those who want to sweep away sovereignty
or the principles of sovereignty, in the name of humanitarian reasons.
Of course, that is only one of the pretexts but not the only one as we
see in Africa.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Africans themselves are rightly concerned
about tackling the problems of peace in their continent. They are trying
to unite. They have a strong sense of unity. They also have their regional
groupings and are trying to settle their conflicts. But who occupied and
exploited Africa for centuries? Who kept it in poverty and underdevelopment?
Who drew those border lines that cut through ethnic groups now separated
by them?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With great wisdom, really great wisdom,
the Africans, from the time they started emerging as independent states,
set out the principle of the inviolability of the frontiers whereby the
inherited borders were sacred. Otherwise, a huge number of conflicts would
have unleashed in Africa.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The colonial powers created all that. They
are responsible for centuries of exploitation, backwardness and poverty.
Are we going to resort to a racist interpretation of the reasons for the
poverty of those African peoples when it is a known fact that, in that
continent, various civilizations had attained remarkable progress at a
time when in Berlin, Paris and many other places of civilized Europe there
were only wandering tribes? A thousand years before, there already existed
a civilization in Egypt, Ethiopia and other parts of Africa.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The United States emerged as a nation only
20 centuries later. What is the cause of that poverty if not the colonialist,
slavery, neo-colonialist, capitalist and imperialist system that reigned
in the world in the past centuries? Why could those peoples not benefit
from the fruits of science and human progress? Those who exploited them
for centuries are guilty for this.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At one time, they also had China semi-colonized
and humiliated. It is common knowledge that, in the past century, they
used cannon shots to open up Japan's ports to world trade. It is a known
fact that the British empire sent its troops to conquer a portion of Chinese
territory and, in a coalition with other European powers and the United
States, it sent troops as far as Beijing. Thus came the opium war, invasions
and wars to sell opium.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now they want to invade countries where
poppies are planted, and not by the country but by a number of hungry and
sometimes desperate people. Impoverished nations, aware of the huge market
for drugs in the United States --one which was not created by a Latin American
country or any other nation in the world-- plant poppies or coca for the
colossal consumption of the industrialized and rich countries.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The question could be asked of how much
drug per capita is consumed in the United States of America and in Europe.
Possibly much more than in Brazil or Argentina, Uruguay or Paraguay, Central
America or Mexico, or even in Colombia itself. The market is up North.
It was a disgrace for our countries, those where the crop arose, that there
was such a high demand in the United States.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is important because yesterday was
hardly the first time that they publicly tried to promote the doctrine
that they have been elaborating against sovereignty, that they have been
discussing among themselves and with other NATO members, the one they have
been advancing little by little, step by step.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The so-called global threats are also considered
enough reason to fully justify an intervention. We will quote four of those
threats: drugs, terrorism and the possession of weapons of mass destruction.
Of course, this has nothing to do with them. They can have all the weapons
of mass destruction they want, thousands of nuclear weapons, as it is the
case of the United States. They can also have rockets that, with great
accuracy, they can position anywhere in the world and a whole arsenal of
laboratories devoted to producing biological weapons --they have used biological
weapons against us-- and any other kind of weapons. They have reached agreements
among themselves to eliminate chemical and biological weapons. But, at
the same time, they develop other even more deadly weapons.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">According to the doctrine described, a
Third World country could have a nuclear weapon and, for that reason, become
the target of a sudden air strike and invasion. And, what about all those
who possess nuclear weapons? It is a matter of wars, either pre-emptive
or punitive, to preserve the monopoly of nuclear weapons and other kinds
of weapons of mass destruction which are very far from being humanitarian.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The fourth reason is the massive violation
of human rights.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Up to now, the great promoter, the great
patron, the great fatherly educator and supporter of those who committed
massive violations of human rights has been the United States of America.
Massive destruction of the infrastructure and economy of a country, as
it has just happened in Serbia; genocide using bombs to deprive millions
of people of crucial services and their means of life; genocidal wars like
the one launched against Vietnam. They were the culprits.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am not talking of the time when more
than half of Mexico was conquered. I am not talking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
a terrorist experiment into the effects of nuclear weapons on cities where
hundreds of thousands of people lived. I am talking about things that have
happened since World War II. Who were their allies? Why did the Franco
government in Spain remained in power for almost</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">30 years after the end of a world war
against fascism that lasted six vicious years and cost no less than 50
million lives? Because he had the support of the United States which wanted
to have military bases there. Who supported utterly repressive governments
in countries like Korea? They did. Who really supported the massive carnage
of ethnic groups like Chinese, for example, or of communists or left-wing
people in Indonesia? They did. Who supported the horrendous apartheid regime?
They did.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There has been no bloody and repressive
government, no massive violator of human rights that has not been their
ally and has not been supported by them. In the case of Duvalier --to give
you an example closer to home-- who supported him? They did, until one
day when they intervened in Haiti to overthrow him, for humanitarian reasons.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Do you realize what I mean? It is the development
of a whole philosophy aimed at sweeping away the United Nations Charter
and the principles of national sovereignty. The doctrine can be divided
into three categories of intervention: humanitarian interventions due to
internal conflicts; interventions due to global threats, which we have
already described, and interventions due to external conflicts, to which
are added the very confusing Yankee concept of <i>"diplomacy supported
by force"</i>. This means, for example, that if Colombia cannot solve its
internal conflict --a difficult battle, of course-- if it cannot achieve
peace, for which many are working, including Cuba, this could become a
reason for intervention. At the same rate, if it does not succeed in eradicating
drug cultivation it could be the target of an armed intervention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have tried to collect precise information
on what is happening with drugs in Colombia, how encompassing the phenomenon
is and how many hectares of drug are planted. Some have told me that there
are about 80,000 hectares of coca, just coca. It has been growing. And
some have talked to me about up to a million people working in the cultivation
of coca and the harvesting of leaves.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I asked about coffee and they told me that
there are problems because the salary of a coffee harvester can come to
10 or 12 US dollars while those who harvest the coca leaves or clean the
plantations, weed the crop and do other similar activities, earn five or
six times higher wages.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What I do not know yet is whether they
fertilize it although that is, seemingly, a natural process. Perhaps, with
a certain regime of rain and climate the coca plant fertilizes itself.
Maybe it is like the <i>marab&uacute;</i>. The <i>marab&uacute;</i> is
a very harmful plant for agriculture here, terribly aggressive and thorny.
It reproduces and spreads easily. It cannot be used to feed the animals
but it is a leguminous plant, so it does not need to be fertilized. It
feeds itself from nitrogen through the nodular bacteria in its roots. Apparently,
something similar happens with the coca.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Can you imagine what the situation must
be like in a country where a million people in the rural areas can earn
50, 60, 70 US dollars in the coca fields while the same working day in
other crops would bring them 10 US dollars at most? And, at harvest time
--and coca can be harvested three times a year-- it is only a matter of
pulling off leaves.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Trying to learn about this I have almost
become an expert by now, just by asking questions. I say: "Tell me, explain
to me, are they all small plantations?" They tell me: "No, there are large
estates of hundreds of hectares and plantations of as much as thousands
of hectares". I ask: "How much earns, for example, somebody with a hectare
of coca?" "That one receives the least," they say. The others receive more:
the ones who turn it into the basic paste, the other ones who refine it
and, fundamentally, those who market it. Before that phase, many airlines,
transport companies and firms providing other services obtain high incomes.
When such a cancer is introduced in a society it becomes a real tragedy,
in every sense, because the danger that internal consumption may spread
is multiplied.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are striving against it ourselves. You
were saying that tourism should not affect culture or damage the national
identity but it can sometimes damage health, if prostitution, for instance,
is promoted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When I talked to you about the US dollar,
I told you that it circulates here. The measures that we have had to take
made its circulation necessary. Well, but that dollar neither escapes the
country nor becomes volatile. It is a dollar that circulates here whose
value decreases every day. It has to do with a historical stage. At the
moment, we are not so interested in lowering its value, rather, depending
on the resources available, we are interested in raising wages in Cuban
pesos, without letting the peso lose its current parity in US dollars.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is good not to be a part of the International
Monetary Fund!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The truth is that the circulation of the
US dollar, coupled with the unrestricted entry and exit of a lot of visitors,
can encourage the drugs trade and the cultivation of drugs which forces
us to be very watchful.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Taking back the problem of Colombia, somebody
told me: "One hectare of coca can provide an income of up to 4,000 US dollars."
I said: "And if it were planted with corn, in that tropical and rainy plain?"
You all know that the Colombian plains are not a corn-growing area. The
corn-growing area is a bit further North, at the same height as the central
plains in the United States and also at the height of Europe, although
corn originated in this hemisphere, in Mexico, Central and South America.
Therefore, I assure you that planting corn there without fertilizers or
anything would hardly give the peasant one ton per hectare. A ton of corn
on the international market is worth more or less between 100 and 150 US
dollars. In Argentina and other places, the export price has decreased
to 90 US dollars. We have to import them so, we know the cost of each of
these grains.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have not talked about wheat which cannot
be planted there. Corn, for example, can be planted for self-consumption
or to market it. How much is the producer paid for his ton of corn that
the middleman then sells in the market? On the other hand, if custom barriers
are also removed then the grains produced abroad would enter freely. That
is what the United States wants from its trade agreements with Latin America.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In that case, the Colombian would eat American
corn because it is produced cheaper than Colombian corn. They obtain six,
seven or more tons and cultivation there is very mechanized. They produce
it cheaper than the French. The French should be careful about American
corn because they will put it in France at a lower price than it costs
to produce a ton of corn there. That is why agricultural issues become
the great obstacle for the free-trade agreements.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Yankees are reckoning: "I will give
you some industrial advantages as soon as possible. I will give you an
X number of years for you to start reducing the tariffs on the grains that
I will export until the day that entry is unrestricted." We know very well
what is going to happen: these countries will end up with no corn farming,
then corn will be very expensive and to the extent that the price rises
there will not be any other corn but the American’s.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But, how much would our farmer earn after
changing a hectare of coca for one of corn? Instead of 4,000 US dollars,
he would earn whatever he is paid for his corn by a middleman or by a chain
of middlemen. It might be 60 or 100 US dollars. So, where are the possibilities
for alternative crops?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They have already created a drug culture.
They have alienated millions of people with their voracious market and
their money-laundering. It has been the United States banks that have laundered
the vast majority of the funds coming from drugs. They are not just a market
but practically the financiers, the drug money launders. Moreover, they
do not want to spend money to really eradicate the growing of coca or poppies,
although they invest billions in repressive procedures.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I think that, theoretically, there might
be a solution but it would cost billions of US dollars, even if those resources
were rationally invested. What are they going to do with the men who live
massively on drug growing. Are they going to be exterminated? They could
also go there themselves and invade that country on account of "a global
threat" even if the drug problem cannot be controlled with simple repressive
measures. Of course, invading it would be madness because the heat in the
forests of the Colombian plains would finish off their soldiers used to
drinking Coca-Cola on combat missions, cold water at every hour, ice cream
of the best quality. Actually, Vietnam is a well known case in point and
they get more and more used to every kind of luxury and comfort.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The mosquitoes and the heat would almost
suffice to finish them off but they could cause a real disaster if they
intervened there to eradicate drugs. Certainly, that would not be the kind
of war to use B-2 bombers because the coca crops cannot be fought with
laser-guided bombs, smart missiles or planes. There, they would surely
have to go in with ground forces, either to wipe out an irregular force
in the jungle or to eradicate crops. On the other hand, since they describe
guerrilla warfare as terrorism, insurgency and a great risk --practically
a global threat-- there we have a country with two possible pretexts for
intervention. I am talking of two categories: internal conflicts and drugs.
Two causes for intervention according to the theories they are trying to
impose.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Would an invasion or the bombing of Colombia
solve the internal conflict? I wonder if NATO could solve that problem
now that it is establishing the right of action beyond its borders. In
principle, they agreed on that during the 50th anniversary celebration.
Along such lines you can imagine so many cases. Is there anybody who believes
that could be the solution?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I know, through opinion polls, that in
their desperation at the violence and the problems in the country, not
a few people in Colombia itself --actually a number of people worth taking
into consideration-- have expressed support for the idea that, if there
is no other solution to the violence, it be resolved through the intervention
of an outside force.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Of course, the fighting and patriotic tradition
of the Colombian people should not be overlooked. I am sure that such an
act of madness against a country like Colombia, in the style of what they
did in Serbia, would be a disaster, absolute madness. But, no one knows,
really, since International law, the principles of respect for sovereignty
and the United Nations Charter no longer provide a reliable coverage and
that could be a decision taken on their own by a Mafia armed to the teeth,
which is what NATO has become.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The rest of the countries, ours included,
cannot feel safe. Not at all! And there is the risk of insane actions that
cost millions of lives. I am sure that an invasion of Colombia, that is,
the implementation of this doctrine in Colombia would cause millions of
deaths. That is a country where violence is rampant, where 30,000 people
meet a violent death every year --a figure that is well above the average
of violent deaths in the rest of Latin America.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now, would an invasion by NATO forces solve
the problem? No, but then, they would come say as Solana did: "Diplomatic
or peaceful ways were exhausted."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Latin Americans, we should try to cooperate
with Colombia, with the country itself (APPLAUSE), to help it achieve a
fair peace, one that would benefit everybody.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are formulas that, in my view, are
so complex and difficult that I would tend to call them utopian because
there is not one war there but three or four. There are significant guerilla
forces with political motivations but divided into two organizations fighting
on their own. There are extremely repressive paramilitary forces at the
service of the landowners and there are the forces of the drug growers,
people armed to shoot down the crop-spraying helicopters, for example.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Colombia's situation is really complex.
I have mentioned it in the context of the theories that I have described
and the consequences that they might have.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We should all help! It should never be
said that the diplomatic and peaceful ways have been exhausted, the discussions
should never stop. A process has already begun. Venezuela wants to cooperate.
We cooperate to the extent of our possibilities and so do other countries.
Colombia's domestic problems have no solution other than a political and
peaceful settlement. This is crystal clear to me. Let us help the Latin
Americans find these solutions!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If one day we had a federation of Latin
American states, if there were unity, we would give up many of the attributes
of our sovereignty. Then, domestic order would become the prerogative of
a supranational state that is ours and does not belong to a foreign superpower
that has nothing to do with us (APPLAUSE) or to a powerful Europe.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We want to involve in friendly relations
with Europe, also in trade, science and technological development but it
also has absolutely nothing to do with the domestic problems of our countries.
We would surely be capable of solving our domestic problems ourselves politically,
without bombings, destruction and bloodshed. We do not need anyone to do
it for us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Why are they going to demolish the principles
of the United Nations? I could begin by exploring some examples. It would
occur to me to ask how the NATO doctrine would apply to Russia, for example,
if a conflict broke out there like the one in Chechnya or various other
conflicts that might arise from the fact that the state is made up of numerous
different ethnic groups that also have different religious beliefs. Also,
an internal conflict might arise among the Slav Russians themselves because
some are communists and others are liberals or neo-liberals or some position
in between. And then what? Would they invade Russia? Would they unleash
a nuclear war?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Russia was a superpower. There used to
be two superpowers. Today, there is one superpower and one power. What
makes the difference? That the power can destroy the superpower three or
four times over and the superpower can destroy the power 12 or 14 times
over. In other words, quite a few more times over. But just once is enough,
is it not? Can they go about applying such theories?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the UN Security Council they have had
intensive discussions. A draft resolution has been passed by that body.
If you would bear with me, really, I could tell you some even more interesting
things. But I want to finish with this, I mean, the matter of the doctrines
that are being developed. That is why I asked the previous question.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will ask another: If there is a conflict
in India, it might be a border conflict --right now, there is artillery
fire on the Indo-Pakistani border-- can the doctrine be applied there?
Would it apply where there are more than a 100 million Pakistanis and,
on the other side, almost a billion Indians, from many different ethnic
groups? Can such a deranged theory be applied in countries that, furthermore,
possess nuclear weapons? I do not know whether they have 50, 100 or 20
nuclear weapons. But just 20 would be a huge amount and the war could become
nuclear. How many would die enforcing this American formula inexplicably
supported by Europe? Total madness!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will go a bit further: What if the conflict
is in China, where there are different ethnic groups, in a country with
a population of more than 1,250 million and with an extraordinary war experience,
courage, fighting spirit. This is the case with every people, of course,
but the Chinese were forced to confront many acts of aggression and difficulties.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We also remember that during the Korean
War as [General] MacArthur's troops were approaching the Chinese border
and some were already talking about attacking the other side, a million
Chinese combatants crossed the border and reached the present demarcation
line. One million! Of course, the number of fatal casualties could have
been --I cannot guarantee the exact number-- perhaps, up to 200,000 Chinese
soldiers. The United States already had all sorts of bombers and other
weapons but the human masses could not be contained and they would not
have been able to achieve victory, not even with nuclear weapons.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How would the doctrine apply in China,
a country they are constantly harassing with campaigns about human rights
as they do with our own country? There have been some significant problems
there widely exploited by Western propaganda. But, imagine how confused
those young people were who took as a symbol the Statue of Liberty, as
it stands at the entrance of the port of New York. They must have been
widely alienated to choose what has become a symbol tainted by the hypocrisy
and voracity of an empire that goes around suffocating and insulting every
idea of justice and true human freedom.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is striking that this happened in a
country with a culture thousands of years old and a much more solid identity
than that of any of us, that is, a more integrated country, more distant
from the West in terms of language, culture, traditions and many other
things. It is not a country like ours, which has a lot of ingredients from
Western customs and culture, but a country that has often been humiliated
and where an extraordinary social revolution eradicated age-old famines.
It is a country that in barely 50 years raised to its current prestige
and the impressive place it occupies in the world.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How would they solve it? If they feel like
it, the imperialists and their allies could declare any incident that occurs
in areas of China that have been turned into bones of contention a massive
violation of human rights. Buddhist Tibet, for instance, is mentioned and
certain Muslim minorities in the north-west. We closely follow, through
the international press dispatches, China’s constant harassment by the
West. Any domestic political problem could be considered a massive violation
of human rights. They constantly go to great lengths to provoke it, moved
by petty propaganda purposes and the stupid attempt to do with China what
they did with the USSR. They simply fear that great nation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Of course, the Chinese are wise politicians
--that is why people talk about the Chinese wisdom-- and they do not easily
make the mistakes that a team of serious and skilled leaders should not
make. They would not invade a country to take it over. They are, indeed,
very zealous in matters relating to their own affairs. They strictly follow
the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
For many years, they have been demanding the return of Taiwan to Chinese
territory but they are ready to wait peacefully for a hundred years. Their
mind set is that of a millennia-old patience, so they talk about what they
intend to do in the next 50 or 100 years as if it were tomorrow or the
day after.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Any of these problems might be an excuse
to send B-2 bombers, all sorts of missiles and laser-guided bombs. Some
of the principles of their absurd and arrogant doctrine could serve as
an excuse to attack China. Is that not an insane proposition? I am no longer
talking about Colombia, I am talking about China, I am talking about Russia
or India or the conflict between India and Pakistan. We will see if those
in NATO and their Marshall --their leader or Marshall Secretary General--
are really excited enough to solve the conflict in Kashmir with a "humanitarian
intervention".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I ask: What is that doctrine for? Why think
about such methods? Whom are they going to apply them to? Only to smaller
countries that have no nuclear weapons and to the rest of the world, wherever
there might be a problem among the many that constantly arise.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Such formulas do not apply to us, just
in case anyone thinks that we are concerned by what might happen to us.
Putting aside all conceit or boastfulness our country, which has endured
such hard trials, can sing <i>The Pirate's Song:</i> <b><i>"And if I die
/ What is life? / I already gave it up / when the slave yoke I shook off/
as any brave man ought."</i></b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I still remember some of those lines which
were in <i>The Hundred Best Poems in Spanish Language</i>. Nowadays, you
do not see such books around much but at a certain time when we did not
have many works of literature I took to learning such poems almost by heart
and I still remember some of them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We, Cuban revolutionaries, can say: "And
if we die, what is life?" And there are a lot of us, Cuban revolutionaries.
We know that no true revolutionary, no true leader of the Cuban revolution
would hesitate to die if our country became the target of an aggression.
(APPLAUSE)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I will say more, because we deeply analyze
all their technology and their tactics and there is no war, big or small,
and no criminal and cowardly bombing that we have not studied well. Aside
from the fact that it will not be easy for them to find an excuse.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They are always inciting and scheming against
Cuba, trying to stir up conflicts inside our country. They go to great
lengths to create any kind of internal conflict that would justify monstrous
crimes like they have just committed against the Serbs.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those irresponsible people who in our country
put themselves at the service of the United States and receive a salary
from the U.S. Interests Section are really toying with sacred things. They
are toying with the lives of our people and they should be aware of that.
The empire, knowing that Cuba would not give in, longs to accumulate enough
forces with its blockade, its propaganda and its money to create internal
conflicts. We are not talking of family remittances, we are talking of
the United States government money. It has been publicly recognized there
as well as in its own laws or amendments. They have recently declared that
any American can send money to any Cuban. They have practically said: "Let
each American buy a Cuban." And I said to myself: "We should raise the
price (LAUGHTER) since there is one Cuban to 27 Americans."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They authorize family remittances but no
more than 300 US dollars every three months. Cuba is the only country in
the world with such restrictions. No, they do not raise by a dime the amount
authorized for people of Cuban descent to send remittances to their relatives
but they invite Americans to send remittances to any Cuban. Perhaps, they
will work through the telephone book, I do not know. They also give money
to whatever small group or faction, to anyone. In their eagerness to stir
up conflict, they have so declared and they have passed legislation about
sending money. It is a serious matter. Extremely serious!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In their arrogance and disdain, they do
not accept that Cuba is resisting. It is so hard for them to accept that
they would like to vanish us from Earth, like they tried to do with Serbia.
It is just that here it is different, or rather not. I would absolutely
not question the Serbs’ heroism and courage. Absolutely not. A country
is not braver than any other, what makes people brave are their convictions
and certain moral values. (APPLAUSE) It can sometimes be a religious conviction
that leads a person to martyrdom, or it can be a political conviction served
with religious fervor.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For example, our doctors who are in very
isolated places in some countries of this continent or in neighboring Haiti
show a heroic attitude, the morality of missionaries, like true priests
working for human health, pastors at the service of life, of values. I
was reading today that some journalists had left for Haiti in order to
inform the people and the relatives of those stationed there on the work
that they are doing in the remotest places. Many of those doctors are women,
some with children here, and they work in faraway places which can sometimes
only be reached after three days of walking through swampy ground.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some people have been contesting or rather
trying to create unrest about our doctors in one of those fraternal countries.
They are disputing our doctors' degrees. Ah!, but as soon as they ask,
we will humbly and immediately forward them the curriculum vitae of each
of those doctors and the grades they obtained in school, at the university,
the specialist courses they have done, the surgeries they have performed,
the lives they have saved. It would be wonderful to send the records of
every one of them!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our doctors are working there with humility
and dedication in compliance with agreements signed by the governments.
They are not there as an imposition. The moment any government tells us
that their presence is inconvenient or that it creates any political problems,
we shall immediately withdraw our doctors. This is it. But they work as
missionaries, it could be said like true heroes. We know this very well
because we are informed of what they are doing and we talk at great length
with some of the people in charge of their activity when they come here.
Our doctor’s work is the expression of their own values.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We can say with satisfaction that if the
World Health Organization wanted to implement a health program, or Europe,
even our neighbors up north if they wanted to salve their consciences a
little and were ready to contribute with the medicines, we would be able
to send 10,000 doctors wherever they are needed in Latin America. We also
have doctors in the north of Sub-Saharan Africa, working there for free
in an ambitious health program.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If this country --I have to say it again--
if we sent one out of every three doctors on such missions, the two remaining
would carry out their work and health care in our country would not be
hurt. And, if we sent one out of every three we would still be the country
with the highest rate of doctors per capita among all countries in the
world --higher than industrial Europe, higher than Sweden, higher than
Denmark and, of course, higher than the United States, Canada and other
great industrialized nations. Yes, a poor and blockaded country can also
do things. This is a fact. And we have more teachers too and possibly more
art instructors per capita than any of those countries.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I state the same thing about sports because
we have about 30,000 qualified physical education and sports teachers,
most of whom are university graduates. They know not only how to palpate
a muscle but they know what muscle it is that they are palpating because
they have a university education.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We also have another small merit, which
is the highest number of gold medals per capita in the Olympic Games. And
we shall continue to have them, even if the games go professional because
we have just proven that our modest amateur sport can compete with good
professional teams. It is obvious that a small and poor country can do
things. They are wrong to underestimate us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Really, this is not bragging; on the contrary,
we prefer to discuss our mistakes, to criticize ourselves but after seeing
the insolence, the demagogy, the lies and the slanders against Cuba we
have no other choice but to talk about some of the things we have done.
Anything else would be foolish, I mean, boasting here about what we have
done. We are rather very critical of ourselves for not having done more
and for not having done it better. That is how it is. I am saying it in
all honesty. I think that one of the reasons for the resistance and the
survival of the revolution is that the leaders here are never complacent.
We hope and we dream that they will continue the same way in the future
as well. And, of course, we have great confidence in our people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was telling you that if it occurred to
them to carry out one of those mad actions against us, they would not only
find the people I have described but one with a sound political culture
and important, sacred values to defend. This fight has been going on for
many years and I can tell you that we will not ask for a truce. No truce!
(APPLAUSE) The people in charge of this Revolution would die rather than
make a single concession of principles to the empire. (APPLAUSE)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Rather than relinquishing a single atom
of our sovereignty, those of us responsible for leading our people in peace
and in war, in every endeavor, we would not survive capitulation. We are
deeply committed to what we have done all our lives and because we feel
it very intensively, because our commitment rests on convictions and values,
we would stand right under the bombs rather than surrender.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In such an adventure it is not difficult
to die. There is no greater glory! At least we would be setting an example
for others! The Yugoslavian people set an example. They resisted the most
unbelievable bombings for almost 80 days, without hesitation. We knew about
the spirit of the people there through our diplomatic representatives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not intend to criticize anybody. I
respect the decision that any government might take and it does not escape
me that decisions are difficult under certain circumstances. But, for us
they will not be at all difficult because we solved that problem a long
time ago. If they were to do that here, they would be defeated, as simple
as that. Not even a genocide would give them victory because there is a
limit to their killing capacity, and I firmly believe that, if the aggressors
had had to extend those bombings for 15 or 20 more days, the world and
the European public opinion would not have accepted it. A few days before
the famous peace formula was imposed on Yugoslavia, the world opinion was
increasingly turning against the aggressors, I have a large number of newspaper
articles reflecting exactly that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Of course, nobody would have been able
to impose that on us because we have been here alone, all by ourselves,
all alone for a long while, near the mightiest power that ever existed.
So, who could come here to impose it on us?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Nobody could. And we do not need any mediator.
Honor is not negotiable! Our homeland is not negotiable! Dignity is not
negotiable! Independence, sovereignty, history and glory are not negotiable!
(PROLONGED APPLAUSE)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There would be no negotiating with us for
a cessation of bombings. I will advance that if they started bombing some
day, they would have to continue for a hundred years if it was a war from
the air they wanted to make; or they would have to stop dropping bombs
because as long as there were a few combatants still alive in this country,
they would be forced to send ground troops. I would like to know what would
happen if they did that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As I was saying, we do not do anything
foolish that they can use as an excuse. You can see how patient we have
been with that [Guantanamo] base. It is a small piece of Cuban land and
we have every right to have it back. The people here have had quite a radical
view of the issue. Not us, we are patient. We say: "No, it is much more
important to liberate the world than to liberate that beloved piece of
land that we will never give up." They would have loved it if we had started
a strong national movement claiming the base in order to have an easy pretext
for their adventures, to deceive US and world public opinion, to say that
we have attacked them. Before concluding, I will show you some things in
this respect. But they have never had the remotest chance of saying that
Cuba has been hostile or aggressive toward the American military personnel
stationed there.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What can they say about us on humanitarian
issues? That we have not a single illiterate, that we have not a single
child without a school, not a single person without medical care. That
there are no beggars here although there are sometimes irresponsible families
who send out their children on errands. That is associated with tourism
and it affects, if not our identity, at least our honor. There is nobody
abandoned in the streets.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What can they say? That we have a massive
number of excellent doctors as I have been telling you about. What else
can they say? That we can save hundreds of thousands of lives each year
in our hemisphere and in Africa.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What did we tell the Haitians? That we
are willing to put forward a plan to save some 30,000 lives a year, 25,000
of them children's lives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What was our proposal to the Central Americans?
A plan to save, every year, as many lives as the hurricane took, if it
actually took 30,000. That figure decreased later because many that were
missing began to show up. As we said, the lives that could be saved every
year could be as many as those taken by the hurricane, if the highest figure
announced was true --and that is a conservative estimate. The truth is
that, on that program, we were ready to contribute the required staff and
we asked that any industrial country, no matter which, contribute the drugs.
Why is it that all those spending so many billions on bombs and genocide
do not use a little money to save lives?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I told you the other day about how they
attributed loathsome things to us and I mentioned a number of them. I told
you and I will repeat it now: Not a single person is tortured in this country!
Not a single political assassination! Not a single vanished person! Forty
years have already passed since the triumph of the Revolution despite all
the conspiracies and all the efforts made to divide us, to subvert the
Revolution. They have crashed against our people’s iron-like unity and
patriotism, against their political culture. All this under extremely difficult
circumstances.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am absolutely certain that very few people
would resist the almost 10 years that we have resisted after loosing all
our markets and supply sources and with a tightened blockade. They underestimated
us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Also, if they carried out one of the acts
of madness mentioned, they would be underestimating us and I do not think
they underestimate us quite that much, I really do not. I will say no more.
We are not defending ourselves here but the right of other peoples who
do not have our possibilities or our unity or the fighting capacity that
we have as an organized and prepared people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I already told you, and I am not dramatizing,
that we have no need for that kind of new specialist who emerged from this
war in Yugoslavia with the category of mediator. They can come only to
report that they will proceed to suspend the bombings or withdraw troops
or to cease all hostilities. This much we dare say: No weapon has been
invented that can conquer man! We are not afraid of those repulsive and
cowardly wars where they do not risk a single life! They are nauseating,
disgusting but they only make us better socialists and better revolutionaries.
That is all. (APPLAUSE)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was telling you that an important battle
was fought at the United Nations. Here is the famous Resolution. They are
incorrigible cheats, mediocre and incompetent politicians. I brought some
papers but I will just use a few things I underlined.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Well, this is the agreement that was passed,
the draft Resolution. Who sponsored it? Germany, a NATO country; Canada,
a NATO country; the United States, a leading country and chief of NATO;
the Russians are among the sponsors because they reached previous agreements
in the Group of Eight but they made a critical speech there; France, a
NATO country; Italy, a NATO country; the Netherlands, a NATO country; the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a NATO country. I
counted them and I saw that there were seven NATO countries among the 12
sponsors of the draft in the Security Council --seven countries involved
in the aggression.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There was also, Gabon, a French neocolonial
dominion and Slovenia, a former Yugoslav republic. This was the first one
that --heedless of the constitutional rules set forth when the Yugoslav
Federation was created recognizing the right to secession and the procedures
to accomplish it-- encouraged by Germany and Austria unilaterally declared
its independence avoiding any legal formality. Yes, there had undoubtedly
been previous groundwork. On the other hand, it was disintegration time!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the republics separated constitutionally
through a plebiscite. That was Macedonia, but Slovenia declared its independence
on June 25, 1991. In Europe, there were doubts over what to do. Later on
came Croatia's declaration of independence, that is, two splits avoiding
all constitutional procedures. And this, as our ambassador to the United
Nations said, was promoted by some European countries and later unanimously
supported by the West.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is important because when that country
emerged --the heroic Yugoslavia that kept even Hitler's troops at bay--
the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia lived in peace, despite centuries-old
national, ethnic, cultural and religious struggles. That area of Yugoslavia,
between the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was a battlefield.
It is well known story that the Ottomans reached the outskirts of Vienna.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have been reading a lot of background
information and, really, there were people who contributed to the so-called
ethnic wars that broke out in the 1990s, people who helped, certainly not
on purpose since I do not attribute it to a premeditated and cynical concept
but to irresponsible acts. Anyway, they unleashed the disintegration of
Yugoslavia and it all began, as I said, with Slovenia on June 25, 1991
when avoiding any legal procedure Slovenia declared its independence and
its leaders took command of the troops corresponding to that republic,
since every republic had its self-defense troops; they were about 40,000
men. As I understand it, some 2,000 young draftees from the neighboring
Croatian republic left for Slovenia. There was practically no combat. There
were only such pressures.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The disease began to spread. Another republic,
Croatia, did the same. In that case, more violent conflicts broke out.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What happened? These republics could very
well have followed the constitutional procedures. Yugoslavia was no longer
a socialist country. It was a country that had established all the capitalist
and market standards. It was not the old Yugoslavia of [Marshall] Tito
and of a later period. It was a capitalist country with the multi-party
system officially recommended by the West.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A very influential factor was that in 1981,
ten years before this happened, Slovenia’s GDP was five times the per capita
GDP of the rest of Yugoslavia. They began to feel that the poorer republics
were a burden and they were encouraged to move toward closer economic integration
with the West. Some supported them --as I said-- some gave them weapons
at that stage, even before they had declared independent. One of their
leaders has admitted this much.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On June 21, 1996, in a program on the Ljubljana
television specially devoted to the fifth anniversary of independence,
President Kucan conceded that "Slovenia was already building up its army
before 1990 in anticipation of a war." In the same interview, the Slovene
president added: "The European Union played a great role in making possible
the breakup from Yugoslavia."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is real history. I do not want to
offend anybody nor do I mean to hurt anyone. I abide by the facts, the
historical facts that we have been looking at again together with some
information we already had when this conflict broke out.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was irresponsible and truly criminal
to encourage and support the disintegration of that country which had achieved
the miracle of living in peace for 45 years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There were different factors bearing on
the situation there, both economic and of a nationalist character, and
there were a lot of people in Europe who understood the potential consequences.
I have spoken with European leaders, European politicians who understood
that this was very risky. However, one day two countries, specifically
Germany and Austria, officially recognized Slovenia and Croatia and, immediately,
the rest of Europe followed, thus beginning all sorts of conflicts that
we now know about.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There were difficulties in Kosovo where
there was a strong nationalist movement. The Albanian Kosovars or Kosovar
Albanians were already a large majority. I remember that even when [Marshall]
Tito was alive, many Serbs had migrated to Serbia because they felt unsafe.
In 1974, the Constitution was amended and Kosovo was granted autonomy --I
have not read that Constitution-- but that is precisely the Serbs’ birthplace.
There are many historical sites there that they value highly. Some of those
sites have suffered with the bombings. But I do not know whether that Constitution
--that I am trying to obtain-- which granted autonomy to the Kosovo province,
gave it the right to secession, as it did with the republics. Anyway, it
was not declared a republic but an autonomous province. I assume that it
did not have that right recognized and that, in any case, there would have
been a process, like in Macedonia.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What began in 1991 has continued until
today and nobody knows when it will end. There were all sorts of wars and
blood was unquestionably shed from both sides. That is the truth, as I
see it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now then, instead of starting to supposedly
straighten out those countries, it would have been better if they had not
been disrupted, if they had not been disorganized. Of course, living standards
were largely different in Macedonia and Slovenia, very different. There
was a Constitution by virtue of which the Socialist Federal Republic was
established. It had the word "socialist" before but more or less after
the perestroika it was removed, that much is clear. Its present name is
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. That is, the name of what is left because
what remained was Serbia and Montenegro since Kosovo was not a republic.
What is left is called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, is it not? I
have some papers here but I will not be looking for the exact name. We
even have here the UN Security Council resolution: "Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia," that’s it. The word "socialist" was removed long ago.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The government may call itself socialist
because you know that there are many governments where there are socialist
parties but the countries are not socialist. There are socialist parties
in many places and in the government, but this does not mean that the country
is socialist or that it plans to be so. They are countries with free enterprise,
neo-liberalization, pure capitalism.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As for Yugoslavia, our position is based
on principles, both with respect to Serbs and with respect to Kosovars.
We defend their right to autonomy. Moreover, we defend not only their right
to have their own culture, their religious beliefs, their national rights
and feelings but also if one day the Kosovars of all ethnic groups and
the rest of Serbia decided to separate peacefully and democratically, once
an equitable and just peace has been achieved and not one imposed from
outside by means of war, we would support them.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No one knows what will happen with Montenegro.
During the war Montenegro behaved the best it could for NATO's taste. It
volunteered some criticisms, some opposition, and perhaps that is why its
quota of bombs was much lower than Serbia’s. I have read many messages
sent by the aggressors to Montenegro encouraging it to secede and it was
accorded special treatment during the war. All the bombs were for Serbia.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When the agreement reached by the Group
of Eight refers to substantial autonomy for the Kosovars, one could ask:
Does it mean the kind of autonomy that Macedonia used to have? We do not
know but, in that case, there would be a peaceful road to independence.
There are many aspects on which Serbs and Kosovars can agree. It is beyond
question that most of the Kosovo population are not Serbs. The Serbs constitute
a minority and it is very likely that after this dreadful war Serb civilians
will follow the Serb troops out. It is apparent. News have come that they
were exhuming their dead because it is part of their traditions to migrate
with the remains of their ancestors.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I do not know what they will do. Messages
are being sent discouraging a massive migration and violence against the
Serbs living there. Those risks exist at the moment. Many are claiming
victory but, who is accepting blame for all the factors that led to this
situation and all the ethnic conflicts? A horrendous crime they are calling
a victory. A victory they would have to be ashamed of because from the
moral point of view if we are to talk about victory and defeat, the morally
defeated were those who waged a cowardly war and dropped 23,000 bombs over
Serbia, some of the most sophisticated, destructive and technologically
advanced bombs. What a victory!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our UN ambassador estimated that the NATO
countries’ GDP is 1,013 times greater than Serbia’s and that the Alliance
member countries have 43 times more regular troops. But, regular troops
are useless in an air war like it was waged there. The difference was zero
to infinite. Bomber planes arriving from the United States were able to
drop bombs from great distances without running the slightest risk. It
was a war that lasted 80 days and in which 23,000 bombs were launched against
a country while the aggressors did not have a single combat casualty. It
was the first time in history that something like that happened.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It must be said that this war, of which
nobody can be proud, is a cowardly war, the most cowardly of all wars ever
waged. The alleged victory was morally Pyrrhic and the war a genocide.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Why was it a genocide? What is a genocide?
The attempt to exterminate a population: you either surrender or face extermination.
How long were the bombings going to last? They were talking of up to October
or November but that was idle talk. We know very well how many European
leaders felt. Many newspaper articles were published on the growing discontent
and opposition to the bombings in Europe and even in the United States.
And there was even greater opposition to ground troops involvement. In
my view, NATO was in no condition to continue that bombing much longer.
Neither Europe nor the world would have tolerated it. NATO would have broken
apart if it had persisted on that path.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As I said that we had three comrades there
with a cell phone, working day and night, round the clock, under the bombs
and with the air-raid sirens, even when there was no electric power. We
always asked them about the morale of the population, about the prevailing
spirit. The people there covered the bridges with crowds; men, women and
children went there so that they would not be destroyed. That was the case
of the last bridge standing in Belgrade.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The NATO planes attacked all the bridges
and there were times when it mostly attacked the electrical network. It
destroyed virtually all the power plants leaving millions without light
and energy. Imagine a house, if they had something to cook, how could they
if there was no fuel, no light, no water? All those pumping systems operate
with electricity. Take away the electricity and the cities are left without
water. Destroy all the bridges and the cities are left without any supplies
whatsoever.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When the electrical service, for example,
is rendered useless a whole lot of basic services become useless too. Imagine
intensive-care units without electricity or water; hospitals without electricity
or water; schools without electricity or water; households, medical and
educational facilities, all facilities and supplies cut off. So, it was
not a war against the military, it was a war against the civilian population.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Then it occurred to Marshall Solana to
make a solemn statement, that "electric facilities were absolutely military
objectives". No one should be so arbitrary with words, ideas and concepts
to justify a genocide. All means of life were under attack. The main workplaces
were destroyed so half a million Serb workers were left jobless and it
is not known how many more will be. Hospitals, schools, embassies, prisons,
Kosovar convoys were attacked. They said that these had been failures.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I remember reading a dispatch about a General
in the British air force who, after 15 or 20 days of bombing, said: "Well,
it is just that our pilots have been very restricted up to now. Now, each
plane will simply go hunting a target." They went hunting targets, whether
it was a convoy of Kosovar refugees they attacked mistaken for Serb troops,
or a prison where they killed 87 people; also, maternity and pediatric
hospitals. There is a very long list of such incidents. Above all, admitting
that a bomb might have been dropped by mistake, the destruction of all
the bridges and electric systems could not be, and was not, a mistake.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What would have happened if the Serbs had
continued resisting? How long could they have prolonged such barbarian
actions?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They UN Security Council adopted a draft
resolution. Of its 12 sponsors, seven belong to NATO, another is a neo-colony
of one of the seven NATO co-sponsors and another one triggered the disintegration
of Yugoslavia in 1991. There is also Japan, a member of the group of the
seven richest countries --and this draft was by the Group of Seven-- and
the Russian Federation, which took part in the meeting of the <i>Group
of Seven plus Russia</i> that agreed on a peace plan and sent its emissaries
to Belgrade to submit it and Ukraine, a Slav country separated from Russia
although it keeps normal relations with it and very good relations with
NATO. These are the 12 sponsors of the draft resolution submitted to the
UN Security Council and produced, in this case, by the Group of Eight.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What happened can be seen clearly, in strict
chronological order.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Marshall Solana gave the order for the
attack and the disciplined U.S. Generals, who were leading the operation,
began the attacks on the night of March 24. They were completely certain
that the attacks would only last three days. Look at how senseless and
shortsighted, irresponsible and poor calculators they were. They estimated
that Serbia would immediately surrender after three days of bombings. The
fourth day went by, then the fifth, the sixth, the seventh...</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have some interesting documents that
might be published some day, various messages in different directions where
our role as prophets shows, and the events unfolded exactly as we predicted
on the basis of an elementary calculation of what was going to happen.
We were familiar with the Yugoslavs' traditions: they fought against 40
of Hitler's divisions and among the countries that took part in that war
it was Yugoslavia that had the highest percentage of dead compared to its
total population. The Soviet Union had about 20 million, as was always
said, with a population of about 250 million. Higher figures were given
later but 20 million was the one always reported, a round figure. The Serbs
must have had some 1,700,000 dead in that war. I cannot tell you right
now how accurate that figure is but I do know that it was the country that
suffered the highest number of dead with relation to its population. They
fought then using methods of irregular warfare and a concept of fighting
with the involvement of all the people.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Right now, the Serb troops are withdrawing
from Kosovo with almost all their tanks, cannons and armored vehicles.
It is amazing! It is amazing that complete units are being withdrawn, as
shown on television, despite the density and the intensity of the attacks
launched against them. They were in perfect conditions for ground combat.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I really believe that they should have
developed other concepts. I say this in all sincerity. This is an issue
to which we have given a lot of thought. They had complete units although
this was not a war of conventional Serbian war units against NATO units.
They could have used tanks, cannons and whatever they wanted but with the
units organized in unconventional ways. Perhaps, or almost certainly, they
had them deployed in a way that was absolutely appropriate for the type
of war they might have had to wage. We have no information on what they
did and how they did it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We knew beforehand what was going to happen,
namely, that they were going to resist. If it had not been for the pressures
they came under from friends and enemies alike, which seems to have been
enormous, possibly the Serb leaders would have continued to resist. I will
say no more. The people would surely have resisted indefinitely. NATO would
have had to decide on a ground campaign or else suspend the bombing and
in a ground war it would not have been easy for NATO to overcome the growing
political obstacles nor would the war ever have ended. That is my point
of view.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Well then, the draft resolution by NATO
and the Group of Eight was adopted and the bombings stopped. In one of
its sections, the resolution adopted reads, and I quote, that the UN Security
Council:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Decides on the deployment in Kosovo, under
United Nations auspices, of international civil and security presences,"
the words seem so harmless, "... and welcomes the agreement of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia to such presences." Well, it does not say what presences.
International security forces, it does not say whose.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It later reads that it: "Requests the Secretary
General to appoint, in consultation with the Security Council, a Special
Representative to control the implementation of the international civil
presence." The question is who is in command there? The United Nations
leads the civil presence, "and further requests the Secretary General to
instruct his Special Representative to coordinate closely with the international
security presence to ensure that both presences operate towards the same
goals and in a mutually supportive manner."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It asks its man to coordinate with the
leaders of those troops while still not saying which troops --a civil leadership
which is the one under the orders of the United Nations-- and it asks the
civil representative to coordinate with the security forces, in case they
pay any attention to him.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Authorizes Member States and relevant
international organizations to establish the international security presence
in Kosovo as set out in point 4 of annex 2 with all necessary means to
fulfil its responsibilities under paragraph 9 below."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It <i>authorizes</i>, they are not under
its command. It <i>invites</i>, knowing beforehand who were <i>invited</i>.
It is said that many are called but few are chosen.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Affirms the need for the rapid early deployment
of effective international civil and security presences to Kosovo, and
demands," a terribly strong word, "that the parties cooperate fully in
their deployment." In other words, that the different countries cooperate
fully. We are also ready to cooperate if they want doctors but not one
soldier because that is not an internationalist or a peace mission. It
is an imperialist mission with very specific objectives. We are ready to
cooperate to save lives. As for the rest, the decisions taken by each one
do not concern us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is known, however, that the British
will have 13,000 troops in Kosovo --the main forces-- with a British General
in command. The number of Americans is unknown. Some marines have already
landed in Greece --they will probably arrive in the thousands. The French
too, and all the aggressors. The figure of Russians is not public although
it is known more or less how many Russians are already there; a press dispatch
has brought the news that somebody said that there could be between 2,000
and 10,000. Who is commanding them? We will see because this is a bone
of contention.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As to the possibilities for the presence
of Russian soldiers, a statement was made yesterday by the current Russian
prime minister [Stepashin] which reads: "The armed forces are in such a
catastrophic state that the military-industrial complex and the army are
barely surviving. We must remember this in next year's budget." What will
be next year's budget? Nobody knows. Even if it is catastrophic, they would
have to cover the costs of the troops which will come to 4,000 or 5,000.
If they get to 5,000, they would only be 10 percent of the so-called security
forces.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What is well known is that regardless of
who accompanies NATO, it will be NATO that will have 90 percent of the
occupying troops under its direct command, and not only its own troops
but also the accompanying troops. There will be countries, such as Ukraine,
that will offer some soldiers. A Latin American country might offer a small
group of soldiers, some young draftees. But, NATO will have everything
there in addition to the thousand planes that took part in the bombing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Russians will, at most, have a helicopter,
a light aircraft to fly from one place to another. (LAUGHTER) The Ukrainians
might have some jeeps and maybe even a helicopter. NATO will have everything
on air, land and sea and command over everything. The discrepancy now is
with the Russians who are embittered, humiliated and threatened, that is
the truth. Actually, with that precedent anybody might think that any day
now missiles, laser-guided bombs and millions of other things could begin
falling on them, especially when it has been admitted that "the armed forces
are in a catastrophic state", which does not exclude the fact that the
strategic missiles do work and they have thousands of them. Yes, they have
thousands of strategic missiles. They are a nuclear power and, of course,
all that is expensive.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The UN Security Council: "Welcomes the
work in hand in the European Union and other international organizations
to develop a comprehensive approach to the economic development and stabilization
of the region affected by the Kosovo crisis, including the implementation
of a Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe with broad international participation
in order to further the promotion of democracy, economic prosperity, stability
and regional cooperation."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The adopted resolution does not say: The
international community should contribute to rebuilding everything destroyed
there, whether Kosovar or Serb. No, what the NATO leaders are declaring
is that the government that made an agreement with them, and yielded to
the advise or the pressures of the Group of Eight’s mediators, must step
down now and appear before the International Tribunal for Yugoslavia where
it has been accused.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Not a word about building anything in Serbia.
About Montenegro, they do say that it will receive suitable treatment,
that it has behaved very well and accepted refugees. But, nothing about
Serbia. Before, they dropped bombs on them for having such a government
and now, for the same reason, they will not help them to feed themselves,
and that after all the destruction. Look how noble, how generous and humanitarian
the United States and NATO are! Do you not think? What is the fault of
children there aged from zero to one, 10, 15 years old? What is the old
people’s fault ? What is the fault of the pregnant women, the retired,
ordinary men and women who have lived through such a traumatic experience?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Often, the most traumatizing about a bombing
is the explosions, the noise. The Nazis, who have been quite well imitated
in this merciless war --and I say this from my heart-- used some terrifying
sirens in their Stuka planes when dive-bombing their targets. I remember
that war. I had just turned 13 when it began but I was interested in all
the news and I read about it. I remember the war almost as if it were yesterday.
In their combat planes, they had some sirens that made a hellish noise
aimed at sowing fear, panic and disarray while they dropped their bombs,
which were not at all like those of today. They were toy bombs compared
to those dropped by NATO over Serbia.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The terror of bombings produces lifelong
trauma, much more so in a child of three, four, five, six, seven, eight
years, who remain day after day and every night under the noise of the
sirens and the explosions. Would any doctor, any psychologist dare say
that those children and millions of people will not endure a lifelong trauma
with the terror they lived under for 80 days from the air-raid sirens plus
the hellish roar of the combat planes engines as they flew at ground level,
which is much more deafening than the Stuka sirens and with much more powerful
explosions than those of the Nazi bombs?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yet, they must now be punished: not one
dime to rebuild a school of those they say were mistakenly destroyed, not
one hospital, not one power plant. What are they going to live on? Well,
now it is a hunger bombing. An agreement was signed with certain leaders
who will handle things and they will know what they are doing. But, I consider
it a crime to deny even a handful of wheat to the Serb people after dropping
23,000 bombs and missiles on them. Then, if the man presiding Serbia remains
in government for three months or six or if he simply stays longer, a year
--I do not know, nobody can foretell-- the people will be subjected to
a genocidal war for a year, all the civilians, all those who are in no
way responsible for any ethnic cleansing or for the masses of refugees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There were 20,000 refugees but when the
massive bombings began people withdrew for many different reasons: out
of fear or because they were afraid of being evicted or suppressed, or
maybe because they were terrified by the bombings or afraid of dying. You
can never say it is only one reason. What is the fault of the children,
the civilians, the hundreds of thousands who were left jobless and other
workers, the peasants, the farmers, the pensioners, the civilian population
in general? What is their fault, really? It is a crime to keep them waiting
until the government changes. To make them wait for a month is 30 times
more criminal and a year would be 365 times more criminal. Each day that
they are denied food is a crime.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I remember that during our liberation struggle
we had an enemy force under siege, with no water or food because we had
cut off their water supply and they had run out of food. Our combatants
handed their cigarettes and their food to the exhausted soldiers who surrendered
because a sense of chivalry had been created in the revolutionary troops
and there was a policy in place for treating the enemy. If a policy like
that does not exist, a war cannot be won. If you mistreat your enemies,
if you torture them, they will never surrender. They will fight to their
last bullet.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We had a strict policy in that sense: after
24 or 48 hours, they were set free. At the beginning, they fought very
hard. Later, when they realized they were lost, they parleyed and the officers
were allowed to leave with their pistols. We did not want to make them
go hungry nor could we give them what little food we had. At times, we
called in the International Red Cross, as we did during the last enemy
offensive when we took hundreds of prisoners in two-and-a-half months of
combat. During the war, we ended up with thousands of prisoners that we
had taken in combat. Entire units were besieged and we treated them gently
because they were our arm suppliers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We did not receive arms from anybody during
our short but intense liberation war while fighting against quite powerful
forces but it did not occur to any of us to surrender. At a certain time
I only had two rifles and other comrades were left with five. We were two
armed groups when we met again, after a significant setback, to resume
the struggle. Comrade Ra&uacute;l's group had five rifles and four men
and my group had two rifles and three men. In total, we were seven men
with seven rifles but we were not discouraged. Twenty-four months later,
we attained victory.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is not self-glorification. It was
a real situation that we had the privilege to live through and I cannot
help but remember it at this moment. When there is a will, when men are
not discouraged, when they believe in what they are doing, no setback will
make them back down!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As I said, our supplier was Batista's army,
organized, equipped, trained and also advised during all that time by American
officers. It was not an army to look down on, not at all. They believed
themselves to be the masters of the world. We had to endure great needs
but we gave our enemy prisoners our food and even our medicine.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have the right to ask ourselves about
that Serbia destroyed by NATO, if the West is going to refuse a handful
of wheat to a pregnant woman in a country that is said to have surrendered
and accepted every condition and still more conditions than those demanded
by the Group of Eight? Is that correct? Is that fair? Is that humanitarian?
I needed to ask those questions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I already told you that they were arguing
over who was going to lead that security force. Of course, there is in
the first place the speech delivered yesterday in the United Nations by
the U.S. ambassador. Actually, that Security Council agreement does not
say under whose command the security forces are going to be. It only calls
for them to go and it is known beforehand who can go and who will go.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now the Yankees are interpreting the agreement.
There comes the time for interpretations! This resolution establishes an
international security force in Kosovo. Now here is the catch. In his speech,
the United States representative says, among other things: "The authorities
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia accepted that KFOR," I do not know
how to pronounce it but that is the acronym --I do not know if it is in
English or in what language-- "the Kosovo International Security Force
will operate with a unified NATO chain of command," this was just yesterday,
after the resolution, "under the political direction of the North Atlantic
Council, in consultation with non-NATO force contributors."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is NATO and under the direction of the
North Atlantic Council, in other words, the NATO Council. Who gave them
permission? The Security Council? No. This demand was contained in the
agreement of the Group of Eight meeting of May 6. Because, on May 6, when
they saw that the bombings were continuing through March and all of April,
forty-odd days had passed, three days many times over and there was not
the least sign of capitulation, they began to worry. Many of those in NATO
began to make up things and they put up a Group of Eight meeting that took
place on May 6, that is, 44 or 45 into the bombings, and they adopted certain
agreements. The Russian prime minister had still not been changed but before
that change took place somebody had been appointed as special envoy of
the Russian government for the so-called peace efforts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am not criticizing that, of course. I
think it was very appropriate that the Russian government did everything
possible to try to find a political solution to the conflict. That conflict
could not have a military solution and they were not in any condition nor
they had any possibility to help the Serbs militarily, only with nuclear
weapons and that is out of the question. Nobody would agree to that. That
form of support would have seemed to us absolutely insane and impossible
and it would have been a worldwide suicide.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But, it was obvious that the Russians did
not even have the possibility of sending a plane with ammunition to Serbia.
Nothing could be sent by land or sea. Hungary, a new NATO member is there
on the border. There are other similar countries there. Nothing could be
sent by land; nothing by air; nothing by sea. They had nothing but their
nuclear weapons left and, let us say, political support, the firm denunciation
of it all.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There was the Agreement of the Group of
Eight under which a peace plan was adopted, a peace plan that after thorough
discussions, was signed on May 6 and adopted or accepted by the Yugoslavs
on June 3, that is, almost a month later. After its approval in May, many
efforts were made: [President] Ahtisaari, from Finland, comes and goes,
the same as Chernomyrdin. There were American envoys and Russian envoys
until June 3, when during a visit to Belgrade the Russian envoy and the
President of Finland convinced the President of Yugoslavia to accept the
formula.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It has been said that the President of
Finland went out and the Russian envoy once alone was finally able convinced
the President of Yugoslavia. Some day we shall know what they said and
how they said it. So, I am not criticizing the Russian peace efforts, that
is quite different from the question of Yugoslav leaders accepting the
conditions imposed on them. I have my personal view of the different things
that might have happened. I will just say that in spite of its immense
power, NATO's position was already weak because you cannot go on bombing
and killing every day before the eyes of the whole world that is watching
a live show of what is going on. There comes a moment when the killing
becomes too scandalous and intolerable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But nobody there talked about who was going
to command the troops. That would be discussed later. Until the last minute,
when the resolution was about to be submitted to the Security Council,
the Russians opposed the idea that the troops taking part in the aggression
be allowed there --that was also the Yugoslav position-- and that there
should be a single command under NATO. The mediators had to consult the
Chinese, and the Chinese had reasons to be irritated by the method, the
procedure used by NATO, the attack on the Chinese Embassy, all those things.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Russians agreed to discuss the draft
first in the Security Council and then discuss the organization and distribution
modalities, the question of security forces in Kosovo. Giving in first
to something and then discussing another important issue is not good tactics.
You give in and when you start discussing then they ask for more. No, sir,
take a few more minutes to get things straight before supporting the agreement,
before renouncing the right to veto and voting in favor.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I know of Russian leaders who have made
serious and honest efforts to find a solution to a really complicated and
dangerous situation. They have weakened themselves a lot politically and
people do not respect them like before. That is why nobody knew who was
going to lead the troops.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But the Americans rapidly found a solution
which is found in the speech delivered by the United States representative
in the Security Council. Look, they were discussing in Macedonia with the
representatives of the Serb troops in Kosovo. They discussed for a whole
day but did not reach an agreement. They returned for a second day of discussions
and used the situation to request a false permit. And now a new finding
which was disclosed yesterday: the role of NATO had already been authorized.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was not the Group of Eight or the United
Nations or the Russians who agreed. They discussed with those Serb military
chiefs in Macedonia and, according to them, the authorities of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia accepted that KFOR operated with a unified NATO
command under the political leadership of the North Atlantic Council, that
is, the Yugoslavs gave them permission. There is evidence that they have
made fools of the Russians. A cable revealing this was broadcast today
showing that the Russians did not like it at all.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am abusing your patience telling you
a story but, after all, your presence here is voluntary while I have no
other choice but to finish when I can, when I am through with what I have
to say. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) Do not get any ideas, I do not make any
extra money for this job which requires an effort. What I want to do, since
they brought me here --it is your fault, I did not volunteer-- (LAUGHTER)
is to complete the ideas I want to present which can be useful to our people,
too. I cannot forget them, they would like to know many things and this
is an opportunity to tell them although it might take some time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They solved the problem. Who? The vanquished.
Nobody else authorized the Americans and NATO and the British Generals
who discussed with them, of course, following strict orders from Marshall
Solana, with due respect to the new Minister of Foreign Affairs of Europe,
the pre-united Europe. He is a pre-Minister of a supranational pre-authority.
These are the tittles, more or less, strictly speaking.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Right away, the United Kingdom takes the
floor and here is another underlined excerpt: "The authorities of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and the Serb Parliament have now accepted the principles
and demands set out in the G-8 statement of May 6 and in the Chernomyrdin-Ahtisaari
paper."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"This resolution and its annexes clearly
set out the key demands of the international community." They are the international
community --NATO is-- to which Belgrade must now oblige.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"They also provide for the deployment of
an international civil presence, led by the United Nations, and for an
effective international security presence to re-establish a safe environment
in Kosovo (...) That is why NATO has made clear that it will be essential
to have a unified chain of command under the political direction of the
North Atlantic Council" --not the United Nations-- "in consultation with
non-NATO force contributors. This force, with NATO at its core, will be
commanded by a British General. The United Kingdom will provide the leading
contribution, at least 13,000 troops."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"To have come this far, to have secured
Belgrade's acceptance of all our demands, required a huge diplomatic effort.
My government pays tribute and expresses its gratitude to Mr. Chernomyrdin,
President Ahtisaari and Mr. Talbot for their outstanding contribution.
The positive engagement of the Russian Government, via its Special Envoy
and in the preparation of this Resolution by Ministers of the Group of
Eight has been vital." They start by saying that the Yugoslavs authorized
NATO to lead the security forces.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Were the Russians happy? Ah, no! I did
not bring that cable, unfortunately. But today there were news from Europe
that a Russian force of about 500 paratroopers who were in Bosnia in over
20 armored vehicles, trucks and some tanks moved forward, crossed over
Serbia and were marching towards the Kosovo border to await there the entrance
of different forces, that is, the solution of the problem of how forces
were going to be distributed and, of course, they have said that Russian
forces will not accept NATO command.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They must have been irritated when, without
saying a word to anybody, 24 hours before the resolution and the American
interpretations, they sent a column of paratroopers in armored vehicles
who have not crossed the border, so far. Undoubtedly, this is an answer
to all these interpretations. They hate accepting the idea and I suppose
that domestically, in their own country where all this has been very traumatic,
it must be very difficult for the Russian leaders to accept that their
troops there --whether they are 2,000, 4,000, 5,000, with or without a
salary-- be under NATO orders. It is only tricks and more tricks on the
part of those who unleashed that dirty war. That is how it has all been.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">These are the two main leaders, of course:
the United States and the United Kingdom. They are also the two countries
bombing Iraq every day. Nobody remembers this but it happens every day.
It has become a habit, a daily shooting exercise to preserve their right
to bomb every day. That is something they do on their own, and with all
these problems nobody even remembers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We had denounced that Yugoslavia had been
turned into a shouting range.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In a declaration on June 1<sup>st</sup>
, that is, just nine days ago, before the government of Yugoslavia accepted
the Group of Eight plan, Cuba issued a Declaration including different
items. Among other things, reference was made to what was going on there
day by day, each target, the attacks. That Declaration said inter alia:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Yugoslavia has become a military testing
ground. Planes taking off from the United States drop their deadly load
on the Serb people, refuel in midair and return to their bases non-stop.
Missiles are air-launched at a distance off the range of anti-aircraft.
Unmanned aircraft are bombing hospitals with patients inside, households
with people inside, bridges full of pedestrians and buses with passengers."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Anybody could say that it was an uncalled
for denunciation on our part. But it so happens that yesterday --June 10,
about nine days later-- in Washington, a France Press cable by Benjamin
Kahn, reported:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"NATO bombings in Yugoslavia against military
targets and civil infrastructure allowed the US Air Force to test several
high-tech weapons, upgraded since the 1991 Iraq War.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Intelligent bombs designed to set their
trajectory in flight were used in the Gulf War but the new upgraded versions
were used in Yugoslavia and in a bigger number than ever before.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Computer-guided bombs allowed the United
States to kill thousands of Yugoslav soldiers from far away, without risking
their pilots or ground troops."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">And it goes on:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Analysts affirm that the massive use of
new Cruiser missiles and other state-of-the-art weapons will continue growing
as a result of the search of the US military to upgrade their capacity
to attack beyond the reach of enemy defense.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Another breakthrough since the Gulf War
was the building-up of missiles noses with titanium to allow them to run
through thick layers of cement and explode causing greater damage.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The new generation of B-2 Stealth bombers
--the most expensive of all-- also made their debut in Yugoslavia.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"At a cost a 2.2 billion dollars each,
B-2s of a super-sophisticated technology, manufactured by Northrop Grumman,
Boeing and General Electric, flew from a base in the state of Missouri
and eluded the Yugoslav anti-aircraft defense and dropped many satellite-guided
bombs in each flight."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Today there are new facts. A dispatch reported
that in three sorties such bombers hit 20% of their targets; 20% of the
targets hit by bombs and missiles. They have been talking about that.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I believe that Mr. Clinton went today to
this air base to congratulate warmly and fraternally the super-heroes who,
always out of reach of enemy weapons, killed hundreds or thousands of persons
or caused who knows what sort of destruction. An exercise in new technology,
and by air. They did not land midway. B-52s, flying straight from US territory,
dropping tons and tons of bombs. They had to be tested using real fire
against real targets.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Bombs dropped by B-2 JDAMs --also new--
use a GPS orientation system weighing 450-900 kilos and costing 18,000
dollars each." Rather cheap for an aircraft that, according to the Washington
reporter, costs 2.2 billion. With 2.2 billion, according to the programs
I have been telling you about, you can estimate the hundreds of thousands
of lives of children, and people in general, in Haiti, in Central America
and similar places who could be saved in a few years. You can almost estimate
how many lives can be saved in one year. (RECKONING) This can be more than
400,000. Saving a child's life never costs more than 500 US dollars: from
a child who dies for lack of a vaccine worth 25 cents to another who dies
from lack of rehydration salts, etc. Let us say 500 US dollars, an exaggerated
figure. With 500 million US dollars you could save almost 1 million people,
if there are doctors and medicines.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With 1 billion US dollars, 2 million children
can be saved; with 2 billion US dollars, 4 million children; with 2,2 billion
US dollars, you could save the lives of 4.4 million children. Everyone
knows, including the World Health Organization, that about 12 million children
die of curable diseases, 10 to 12 million children. I do not recall exactly
the latest figures.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Almost half of those dying in one year
could be saved with the cost of a single aircraft. It would really be humanitarian
to invest the cost of one of these planes in saving the lives of almost
4,5 million children by conservative estimates! Because in the programs
we are designing doctors work for free. We pay our doctors here, with our
currency. We do not have to spend US dollars because they are paid in our
own currency and recently all doctors wages have been raised. As for NATO,
it is surely setting a humanitarian record!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is very sad the way they manipulate
people with lies and demagogy. Actually, you should not leave without these
few facts I still have here to share with you.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I say that there are three basic ideas.
I have spoken of the Group of Eight. I already said who tabled the motion:
seven out of 12 belonged to NATO, those I mentioned.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But, what is the Group of Eight? The Group
of Eight is a company, a small club of the super-rich. On account of their
major influence and money, the United States, Japan, Germany --tremendously
rich countries-- are there and all the others and they set monetary policies
for the International Monetary Fund. They dictate measures for coping with
crises and make certain arrangements if there is a crisis in Southeast
Asia or in Russia or if there is any danger that it may spread to Latin
America.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Seven Rich meet annually. But with
the collapse of the USSR and the improved relations with Russia, once in
a while they invite it. From Russia alone, the West --mainly Europe-- has
taken out 300 billion US dollars. Of course, they did not go there to get
them at gun-point. It was not necessary either because so skilful business
people have cropped up there that they have become multimillionaires in
a few years.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Under the reforms introduced by the West,
Russia has suffered terribly. Its economy was cut by half; its defense
considerably weakened. For granting her a 20 billion US dollar credit,
the West imposes restrictions and demands many conditions that Russia cannot
meet, some of them humiliating. What are 20 billion US dollars in Russia
so badly in need after the August crisis? And spread throughout a whole
year even if it is only one fifteenth of the hard currency that wound up
in the West.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But not only that. The ruble has been devalued
twice. Before, a ruble equaled a US dollar and had a higher purchasing
power in Russia than a dollar. In a few years its purchasing power was
6 thousand times lower, that is, you needed 6 thousand rubles to buy 1
US dollar. All those who had savings, pensioners and others, lost them.
As a result of devaluation, an entire nation lost its money.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They set a new parity and a new ruble.
They took off the zeros, divided it by 1,000 and then, with 6 rubles you
bought 1 dollar. Therefore, when the crisis began, those who had saved
rubles found that their rubles instead of being rated 6 to 1 dollar were
worth only 24 to 1 dollar, one fourth. Once again those with savings had
lost their money. This has happened not only in Russia but in many other
countries as well. Latin America is tired of living through these experiences,
through the repeated devaluations I already mentioned. The currencies become
volatile capital.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Where is the person who having lost all
his savings in his own country twice would want to have his cash in the
national currency again, even if it pays a 40, 50 or 80 percent interest
rate. On the other hand, no economy can withstand that. It is impossible,
because the mechanism recommended by the theoreticians of neoliberalization
in the International Monetary Fund to the countries is an increase in the
interest rate, so that people do not take away their money. Which budget
can withstand 80% rates?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is impossible. Besides, even if interest
rates are raised to those levels, there can be a 400 to 500 percent devaluation,
incomparably higher than the increased rate. What do savers or people with
revenues do? They exchange their money for dollars. No bank can resist
that. How much money would a country need to keep the ruble-foreign exchange
convertibility? An endless amount of dollars.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How many years will pass before the nationals
of a country suffering this problem can have confidence in their currency
again? And there goes the IMF demanding free conversion and lots of other
unpractical things which cannot be implemented. A few estimates suffice
to identify the problem, they change everything to dollars, stuff them
inside a mattress and take them out of the country.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So the country is now very impoverished
and heavily dependent on foreign credits. Yet, I do not believe it must
necessarily be like that. A country like Cuba that has gone through a hard
experience --without fuel, steel, lumber, anything and has survived without
a dime from any international agency-- knows that with its huge resources
that country would not need any credits. As simple as that. I shall say
no more. Just that if we had those resources we would be growing at a two
digits rate. Without anything and despite everything, including the blockade,
we are growing and this year we shall grow from 3 to 4 percent, approximately.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have the right to imagine what could
be done. The revenues of most of our exports are spent just in fuel because
the Revolution took electricity to the most distant places, to the mountains.
Ninety-five percent of the population has electricity although it was less
than 50 percent at the triumph of the Revolution, and oil was worth 7 US
dollars a barrel and with 1 ton of sugar you could buy 7-8 tons of oil.
Then, after the collapse of the socialist camp, oil prices climbed tremendously
and with 1 ton of sugar we could only buy 1 ton of oil.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We do not have the immense Siberian forests,
oil and gas fields. We do not have a significant steel industry and machinery
either. If we only had raw materials and today's experience, because we
must add that we have learned to be more efficient and make a better use
of our resources, the Cuban economy might grow perhaps 12 or 14 percent.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is my conviction, and this is the first
time I say this in public, that that country can save itself. It does not
have to depend on Western credits, sooner or later its leaders will understand
that. But, undoubtedly, today it depends on credits.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I mentioned the Group of Eight. The seven
richest countries in the world, six of them NATO members who unleashed
and took an active part in that war, the other one is not a NATO member
but is the main strategic ally of the United States in the Pacific: Japan.
I do not intend to criticize Japan. We have good relations with that country.
When we were hit by a hurricane after a severe drought, they spontaneously
offered food relief to the most vulnerable populations worth 8 million
US dollars, with which 30 thousand tons of rice were bought. That is a
gesture we appreciate very much. I limit myself to the presentation of
facts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The group of the seven richest countries
in the world except Japan, which is not a NATO member, took part in the
attack on Serbia. The eighth country, Russia, is ironically the country
that has become poorer in less time. Its per capita GDP is at Third World
levels.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is now an impoverished, indebted country
depending on Western credits. Still, I am not suggesting at all that these
were the reasons for the sad role it played in the Group of Eight. I believe
that they were genuinely concerned about the crisis unleashed, the danger
of this adventurous war and the impact on its own population, a mirror
image of what might happen to them some day. They must have grown aware
of all the influence and strength they have lost.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Actually, I would admit that their position
is right in as much as they advocate a political solution of conflicts
and the United Nations Charter. Their speech in the Security Council was
critical and positive but, of course, that is the Group of Eight which
was no longer inviting Russia but this time they called it, met with it
and, in was in those circumstances that they participated.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I think it was this morning that I read
some news on the rapid advance of a column of Russian paratroopers heading
for Kosovo. It caught NATO by surprise; in fact, it caught everybody by
surprise. It was an undeniable answer to the deceit of negotiating permission
with the Yugoslavs so that NATO would head security forces in Kosovo. It
was not a United Nations decision, it was not discussed with Russia. That
was the humiliation, deceit and trickery.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In short, NATO attacked and got stuck.
They invented a meeting of the Group of Eight and fabricated a peace plan.
The peace plan which excited so many discrepancies and differences with
the Russians was finally adopted and taken to the Security Council while
the issue of who was in command of that force remained unresolved. But,
the question had already been solved. Right there in his speech, the United
States Representative informed that they had permission from the Yugoslavs
to take command of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. That is the way the
matter was handled. I think that everything is quite clear.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I want to say something else. We started
delving as deep as possible in the history of that region, its past and
recent history, and we have put together some interesting information.
There is one in particular, however, that has greatly struck our attention.
It was denounced yesterday by our UN Ambassador: when Hitler invaded Yugoslavia
he set up a fascist government in Zagreb which included Croatia, Bosnia,
Herzegovina and a great part of Voivodina, almost to the doors of Belgrade.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The fascist regime of Ante Pavelic enforced
the so-called Three-Thirds Doctrine. What did it mean? One third of the
Serbs were to be deported, another third assimilated and forcibly converted
to Catholicism --the official religion of the country (Croatia) because
the others, the Serbs, were Christians too but from another church, the
Orthodox Church rather close, in general, to the Catholic doctrine although
with evident tensions between them. The last third would be annihilated.
That doctrine became the political orientation of the State machinery which
started organizing all three things with unequally effective results.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many of the converts were finally annihilated
since deportation was not easy. Thus, physical extermination became the
most general practice. Amazing! For us it was a discovery, a holocaust,
a true holocaust of huge magnitude.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In terms of the total Serb, not Yugoslav,
population at that time it is possible that they annihilated (I only say
that it is possible, because I still have not done the exact reckoning,
someone should do it) a higher percentage of Serbs as compared to the total
Serb population living in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina than the percentage
of Jews annihilated during World War II, vis-&agrave;-vis their total number.
A more detailed study would be required. This holocaust has been hidden.
The West never wanted to mention it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have tried to learn as much as possible
about the author of the research contained in this small book [Shows it].
He is a journalist who works with many humanitarian organizations. He was
raised as a Catholic and not in the least close to Marxism-Leninism or
Communism. Looking for materials we found this. We are collecting more
information. Some of his articles have been published and the book is certainly
well written. It contains a lot of interesting data.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now what do Croat and Serb writers say?
Croat writers acknowledge that there were 200,000 victims, that is, those
who were killed under the fascist Three Thirds Doctrine.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What do Serb writers say? They speak of
1 million people killed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What do more reliable sources say? That
they were 400,000 to 700,000.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What does one of the admittedly most reliable
sources, the British Admiralty Archives, have to say? Do not forget that
the United Kingdom was an ally of Yugoslavia at the time taking part in
operations in the Balkans and their archives are considered important,
serious sources. Raising the issue may perhaps awaken interest so that
better informed people can speak up on the it. The British Admiralty Archives
set in 675,000 the number of civilian Serbs killed, including many peasants
and people of all ages and gender who were coldly murdered in concentration
camps or in the places where they lived. Whole villages were wiped out.
That was the figure used yesterday by our UN Ambassador. But there are
other interesting data. I suspect the number of victims to have been higher.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a population analysis based on
1941 population data of three territories --Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina--
their different cultures, ethnic groups and nationalities living there.
Although among Bosnian-Herzegovinians, Serbs and Croats one cannot actually
speak of ethnic differences because the three nations are ethnic Slavs.
There is even a Serbo-Croatian language. The difference is rather cultural,
religious and national. A single ethnic group may have several nations.
In Latin America, besides the language we share many ethnic traits. The
Dominican Republic and Cuba --just to mention an example-- belong to the
same ethnic group and are two independent nations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">According to statistics, in 1941 when there
was still no war, how many Croats lived in that territory? In that territory
the population was 3.3 million. Forty years later, according to the 1981
census, how many Croats were living there? 4,210,000, that is, an almost
one million increase.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Muslims, who are Slavs too but of the Muslim
religion: In 1941, there were 700,000; in 1981, there were 1,629,000 (more
than doubled).</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Serbs, how many Serbs were living in that
same territory in 1941? 1,925,000. How many after 40 years, according to
the 1981 census? 1,879,000, that is, approximately 45,000 less. Based on
these facts, people who have analyzed population, customs, habits, growth,
etc. have estimated that in that holocaust 800,000 to 900,000 Serbs died.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All of us have heard of <i>Oswiecim</i>
and other concentration camps. Some of us have had the possibility of visiting
them and having a terrifying vision of what those concentration camps were.
Now we find out, or we are told, that there was an extermination camp called
<i>Jasenovac</i>, the equal of <i>Oswiecim</i> in Poland. In <i>Jasenovac</i>
lie the remains of hundreds of thousands of Serbs as well as thousands
of Jews, gypsies and people of all ethnic groups. People say that the biggest
Serbian city after Belgrade lies there, below the ground.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How many of you knew about it? Did anyone
of you know or had anyone of you heard about this? We are going to keep
on researching. Could you please raise your hand if you knew it. (SOMEBODY
RAISES A HAND). Good, tell us. (ONE OF THE DELEGATES SAYS THAT A BOOK ON
THIS SUBJECT WAS PUBLISHED IN SERBIA AND TRANSLATED TO SEVERAL LANGUAGES,
BUT THAT IN EUROPE PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY IGNORANT OF THIS CROAT-NAZI FASCIST
ALLIANCE AND THE GENOCIDE THEY COMMITTED).</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Who wrote that book? (HE SAYS THAT HE BELIEVES
IT WAS WRITTEN BY TWO SERBS).</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This one I have here, from which I took
the information we are going to research deeper into --the fact that Croat
writers themselves acknowledge the figure of 200,000, is significant--
was written by Josep Palau, an ethnic Catalonian journalist. Since 1982
he has been involved in many international activities linked to European
peace movements and has been a representative of various non-governmental
organizations. He has also been a United Nations consultant.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I asked our ambassador in New York if he
had any information because we had suggested to him to buy this book (Shows
it). We sent him the references but in a bookstore he was told that it
would take six weeks to get it. Right away, yesterday, we e-mailed him
a copy. He had the whole book there. Then he told me that he had read another
very interesting article by the same author who is considered one of the
most knowledgeable in the history of the Balkans and, in general, about
these problems. We do not know anything else. That is why I asked, in case
any of you knew.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is understandable that Yugoslav leaders
avoided digging into the issue. It is hard to do so when such a horrible
thing has happened. When there have been century-old conflicts, undoubtedly
digging into this type of problems would have run against the aim of building
a solid federation, a united and just state, a peaceful society.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One could ask why the West does not speak
of this holocaust. It is particularly important now when they have been
dropping thousands and thousands of bombs on that same nation. To this
we would have to add that these are only those who died in the territory
of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina because the fascist government imposed
by Hitler covered more territory, including part of Voivodina. However,
it seems that there is information only on the three aforementioned territories,
not Voivodina.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We need to calculate the number of those
who died in the territory ruled by that government and those who died in
parts temporarily occupied by Italian fascists or Hungarian fascists.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The carnage must have ended by late 1942
because in 1943 there were many liberated territories, the guerrilla force
was stronger. I will try to gather information to know what percentage
of the population died in concentration camps at that time. I do not mean
in combats but in concentration camps and killed in cold blood.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A holocaust and no one talks about it,
why? There are sad and painful stories of the more recent massacres and
ethnic cleansing, and I do not doubt that they did take place. I have not
been there or seen it, nor am I going to ask for the papers. It is enough
to know a bit about the history of hatred and real conflicts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But I know too that during the 45 years
that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia existed there was peace
among all those ethnic groups. [Joseph B.] Tito himself was an ethnic Croat
but he knew how to win the love of the Serbs and the Serbs were actually
the backbone of the resistance. It is understandable that in Tito's time
there was not much talk about the matter. Today, in a split-up Yugoslavia
and when in one part of the country a crime such as this has been committed,
it is worthwhile making these truths known.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I must say that it is not my intention
to incite nor blame anybody, least of all the people in that country. I
do not intend to blame Croats for this. It would be like blaming the Germans
for Hitler's massacres of Jews, gypsies and many others who died in concentration
camps, in the systematic efforts to coldly exterminate an ethnic group,
a nation, a multiethnic population or a single ethnic group.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But a holocaust of such magnitude is tremendously
important. Blaming the Croat people would be like blaming the Italian people
for the crimes of that clown named Mussolini. I cannot think of calling
him anything else because that is what he was to a great extent and he
killed many people, invaded, waged war, sent troops to the Soviet Union.
It would be unfair to blame any people for the crimes committed by a fascist
system. I want to make this clear, honestly. I am not blaming anybody,
I simply rely on historical facts.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Something else must be said: The Jews who
suffered the holocaust in Germany and elsewhere were very friendly to the
Serbs and very grateful to them because the Serbs saved the lives of many
Jews. It is even said that the US Secretary of State, on her way from Czechoslovakia
sought refuge in Serbian territory and there she received help and support
from the Serbs. They played a role, fighting heroically against Nazism.
And I reiterate that our stance, the one we hold and shall hold, is based
on principles.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you have a chance, you can read the
speeches delivered by our UN Ambassador. Our position on Kosovo is very
clear there. Not only now, but 12 days after the bombings began, when as
a direct or indirect consequence --surely, in my opinion, in the overwhelming
majority of cases as a direct result-- of the bombings, all sorts of conflicts
must have triggered or worsened, we offered doctors to a religious Catholic
community involved in assisting refugees. They told us about the tragedy
there and we offered to send up to 1,000 doctors. Twelve days after the
conflict began! This is not something new said a week before Cuba spoke
in the United Nations. We did not say it publicly because we left it to
them. Eventually, several weeks ago, we also said it publicly.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Likewise, when the Americans who occupy
a base in our territory informed us --they usually do not do it-- rather
than request permission they informed that they would bring 20,000 Kosovars,
in violation of the terms of the agreement under which they stay there,
an agreement which has been violated by all possible means, but at least
this time they had the decency of telling us, perhaps they thought that
we would say that they should not bring the Kosovars but we told them:
"We absolutely agree that you bring them. We are ready to cooperate in
everything. We can offer our hospitals, water services, all the help we
can give them."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Later, perhaps they thought things over.
Because it was really disgusting to unleash a war which, in its turn, would
unleash a colossal migration, a human drama and bring those people from
Albania to a naval base in a tropical country, a long distance away. I
believe they finally brought 2,000 to a camp in their own territory. Out
of the 1 million, with a generous and humanitarian spirit they have assisted
a little over 2,000 refugees, Great Britain another handful, I believe
that 0.8 percent the two of them combined or some other rather negligible
number of refugees.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We said that we agreed, that they would
be welcomed in the occupied Cuban territory. We offered medical care and
we reiterate it now. That was our clear and categorical position: respect
for their cultural, national and religious rights and support for their
autonomy. We went even further, and possibly many Yugoslavs do not understand
this, or many Serbs do not understand this well, but we admitted the idea
of independence provided all Kosovo ethnic groups attained a fair peace
and the Serbs in other territories of that republic reached an agreement
peacefully and decided to do it. Yes, I say that it has to be peacefully
and mutually agreed.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I believe that such a possibility exist.
Yet, I do not think we should interfere with this delicate issue. We have
stated our position. We have done our duty. We do not do things to make
friends or enemies. Sometimes we hurt friends and make enemies at the same
time. But there is something much more important than any temporary advantages:
seriousness and honesty.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have criticized the Europeans with the
words I have used without having any feelings of animosity against them.
But one day I will be able to demonstrate that I warned them very precisely,
and only seven days after the attacks began, I warned them of what was
going to happen exactly. I apologize for preserving and not declassifying
this material.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the big European mistakes was that
instead of working with moderate forces, they worked with the most extremist
called by them fearful terrorists just a few months ago. It was only in
1998 that the movement went from a few hundred armed men to over 15,000
to 20,000 armed men. Now we have to find out what the famous CIA did, how
many it trained, with which weaponry and what tasks it gave them. What
nobody doubts is that this war practically had a time-table. I believe
that the greatest chance for peace was in supporting moderate groups and
not extremist groups, called terrorists shortly before. They use any term,
any adjective.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is the last idea I want to share.
Why should we be so concerned about this policy, this onslaught on sovereignty,
this attempt to do away with the principles of the UN Charter? Why are
all these theories invented, these doctrines I mentioned, so many pretexts
for humanitarian intervention or against global threats? As I was saying,
there is something called <i>diplomacy supported by force</i> which is
another concept. What else will follow?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have had bitter experiences with the
behavior of US political leaders. Once in a while they elect someone with
a religious ethic. I would dare mention a case in point: President James
Carter. I cannot think of Carter waging this type of genocidal war. But
we have known a few U.S. presidents of whom the same cannot be said.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We have just sued the United States for
181 billion dollars, I already told you a bit about it. I hope they give
you a copy of our legal demand. I think you had one in your briefcases,
but just in case, for the benefit of those who have not read it since you
have not had much time, I will brief you about it. In those pages there
are two things, two major cases of cynicism described. In the lawsuit we
said: "The unquestionable historical truth about these events and the cynicism
and lies that have invariably accompanied all American actions against
Cuba can be found in the original documents of the time, produced by those
who, from within that country, planned the policy of aggression and subversion
against Cuba."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The plots against Cuba and their actions
began as soon as we passed a Land Reform Act because U.S. companies owned
here estates of 10,000, 50,000 and even 150,000 hectares. We passed a Land
Act that logically and inevitably affected their properties and as of that
moment their crimes against Cuba began. By August the first terrorist actions
were carried out, the first plans to assassinate Cuban leaders, and it
was an honor that they devoted a good number of them to me. They started
in November 1959. It is right there, in that same section.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Nobody here had spoken of socialism. We
talked about socialism on April 16, when we buried the combatants who fell
victims of the attacks by U.S. warplanes manned by Cuban mercenaries and
deceitfully carrying painted Cuban flags. They even had Stevenson say a
big lie at the United Nations when he was an Ambassador, the same official
explanation they gave when they said that they were rebel Cuban Air Force
planes.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Actually, it served as a warning about
something we were expecting. We foresaw an imminent mercenary landing in
the attempt to destroy our small Air Force, which they were unable to because
our fighter planes were scattered and the base was defended by anti-aircraft
batteries. They destroyed part of it, but we still had more planes than
pilots and the ones left operational were enough for the time the adventure
lasted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In one of its sections the lawsuit reads:
"In this token, it may be illustrative for this Court that, on March 17,
1960, at a meeting attended by Vice-President Richard Nixon --an angel--
"Secretary of State Christian Herter --who was later not elected president--
Secretary of the Treasury Robert B. Anderson, Assistant Secretary of Defense
John N. Irwin, Under Secretary of State Livingston T. Merchant, Assistant
Secretary of State Roy Rubottom, Admiral Arleigh Burke of the Joint Chief
of Staff, CIA Director Allen Dulles, the high-ranking CIA officers Richard
Bissell and J.C. King and the White House officials Gordon Gray and General
Andrew J. Goodpaster, the United States President approved the so-called
"<b>Program of Covert Action Against the Castro Regime"</b> --a number
of brutal actions are mentioned before in the document-- proposed by the
CIA.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Among other things, that program enabled
the creation of a secret intelligence and action organization within Cuba,
for which the CIA allocated the necessary funds. In a recently declassified
memorandum --they declassified it because almost 40 years have gone by,
and it is a standard procedure-- on that meeting, General Goodpaster noted:
"'The President" --it is President Eisenhower-- "said that he knows of
no better plan for dealing with this situation. The great problem is leakage
and breach of security. Everyone must be prepared to swear that he [Eisenhower]
has not heard of it. [...] He said our hand should not show in anything
that is done."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Serious things were already taking place
here. In August 1959 pirate attacks and bombings began, sugar cane fields
were set on fire by planes coming from the United States and the ship <b>La
Coubre</b> was blown up resulting in the death of 101 Cubans. The meeting
had been held a few days before. Actually, that was a formal meeting, especially
because the CIA had already suggested my assassination before the end of
1959, on December 11. Not even one year after the triumph of the Revolution!
There are other more revolting things and they are here for those of you
who have not read it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is another declassified document.
Nixon was no longer Vice-President nor was Eisenhower President. Kennedy
was President and it was after the Bay of Pigs invasion:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"On March 7, 1962, the Joint Chiefs of
Staff stated in a secret document: ...determination that a credible internal
revolt is impossible of attainment during the next 9-10 months will require
a decision by the United States to develop a Cuban "provocation" as justification
for positive U.S. military action."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"On March 9, 1962, under the title <b>'Pretexts
to Justify U.S. Military Intervention in Cuba'</b>, the Office of the Secretary
of Defense submitted to the Joint Chiefs of Staff a package of harassment
measures aimed at creating conditions to justify a military intervention
in Cuba". See this? They were always looking for pretexts. Some of the
measures considered included the following, which were taken to the Joint
Chiefs of Staff by the Office of the Secretary of Defense:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"A series of well coordinated incidents
will be planned to take place in and around Guantanamo [Naval base] to
give a genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces", one of
their alternatives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The United States would respond by executing
offensive operations to secure water and power supplies, destroying artillery
and mortar emplacements threatening the base. Commence large-scale United
States military operations.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"A 'Remember the Maine' incident could
be arranged in several forms.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We could blow up a U.S. ship in Guantanamo
Bay and blame Cuba.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We could blow up a drone (unmanned) vessel
anywhere in the Cuban waters.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We could arrange to cause such incident
in the vicinity of Havana or Santiago as a spectacular result of a Cuban
attack from the air or sea, or both.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The presence of Cuban planes or ships
merely investigating the intent of the vessel could be fairly compelling
evidence that the ship was taken under attack.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The US could follow up with an air/sea
rescue operation covered by U.S. fighters to 'evacuate' remaining members
of the non-existent crew.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Casualty lists in U.S. newspapers would
cause a helpful wave of national indignation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We could develop a Communist-Cuban terror
campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington.
The terror campaign could be pointed at Cuban refugees seeking haven in
the United States.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We could sink a boatload of Cubans en
route to Florida (real or simulated).</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We could foster attempts on lives of Cuban
refugees in the United States even to the extent of wounding in instances
to be widely publicized.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Exploding a few plastic bombs in carefully
chosen spots, the arrest of Cuban agents and the release of prepared documents
substantiating Cuban involvement would also be helpful in projecting the
idea of an irresponsible government.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"A 'Cuban-based, Castro-supported' filibuster
could be simulated against a neighboring Caribbean nation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Use of MIG-type aircraft by U.S. pilots
could provide additional provocation.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Harassment of civil aircraft, attacks
on surface shipping and destruction of U.S. military drone aircraft by
MIG-type planes would be useful as complementary actions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"An F-86 properly painted would convince
air passengers that they saw a Cuban MIG, especially if the pilot of the
transport were to announce such fact.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Hijacking attempts against civil air and
surface craft should appear to continue as harassing measures condoned
by the government of Cuba.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"It is possible to create an incident which
will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot
down a chartered civil airliner en route from the United States to Jamaica,
Guatemala, Panama or Venezuela.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The passengers could be a group of college
students off on a holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest
to support chartering a non-scheduled flight.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"It is possible to create an incident which
will make it appear that Communist-Cuban MIGs have destroyed a U.S.A.F.
aircraft over international waters in an unprovoked attack".</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Five months later" --of these sinister,
truly sinister variables suggested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff-- "in August
1962" --mark the year-- "General Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, confirmed to President Kennedy that no possibility was
perceived whereby the Cuban government could be overthrown without direct
U.S. military intervention, which was why the Special Group-Augmented was
recommending the even more aggressive approach of <b>Operation Mongoose</b>.
Kennedy authorized its implementation: "‘It's a matter of urgency.'"</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1962: October [Missile] Crisis. Some news
simply came to the Soviets's attention and to our attention. Not this document
I just read, at least, we did not know about it.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But Jrushov was totally convinced. For
us it was something we were used to. We were always mobilized on news of
a possible invasion. We were not interested in having strategic missiles
here. Actually, we were more interested in the image of our country, that
it would not look like a base of our Soviet friends.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The decision was made based on our sense
of solidarity because before the Bay of Pigs invasion they had sent us
many weapons. We had hundreds of thousands of weapons. We had already bought
them from the socialist camp and the USSR since that March 4 when <b>La
Coubre</b> was blown up. It was in 1960, she was bringing weapons from
Belgium. The rest of the time until the Bay of Pigs invasion in April,
that is, 1 year and 1 month later, we received dozens and dozens of ships
with weapons from the USSR through Czechoslovakia: tanks and cannons, anti-aircraft
artillery and rifles.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Very soon we learned how to use them because
the heaviest got here during the first quarter of 1960, and when the Bay
of Pigs invasion was launched we had weapons taken from Batista's army
and some we had bought in Belgium --the second cargo was the one blown
up. We did not want to give them any excuse, as in the case of Guatemala
where they had used the pretext of a ship carrying weapons from Czechoslovakia
to Arbenz's government and blown up the ship. But, by the time of the invasion,
we had hundreds of thousands of men trained and armed, thousands and thousands
of artillery men to operate those weapons. They were not very experienced
but they could handle those weapons and had a fighting spirit.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Soviets were very, very concerned because
they got news of a possible invasion. They gave us the sources, not the
most important, not to me. The information they possibly received was incomplete
but they did give us the information they extracted from their talks with
Kennedy and other high-ranking personalities.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By the time of Bay of Pigs invasion they
had sent us not only weapons but they had also made very strong statements
and even spoken of the missiles. They were irritated because at that time
the Cuban Revolution was like a miracle. They could not have imagined it.
It was not imported or promoted by anyone from abroad. It was truly and
fully ours.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The only thing we imported, actually, were
the ideas or rather the books from which we got a revolutionary political
culture. To this we added some Cuban notions and tailored it to the Cuban
reality. According to Engels --I must say this-- ever since the big avenues
were built in Paris and a rifle firing five bullets was invented, he considered
that from that moment onwards an uprising in Paris o similar places would
be impossible.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We had to build our revolutionary consciousness
when there were planes, tanks, cannons, communications and many things
unimaginable in Engels’ days. Since we believed in a number of principles
and had a tradition, we conceived the idea of an armed struggle, the strategy
and tactics to be pursued.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No Russian had absolutely anything to do
with it. No Soviet. Nobody. Nobody sent us guns either. Nobody gave us
a dime. Later, there were revolutionary movements in this hemisphere that
had tens of millions of dollars. One day I estimated the cost of the Moncada,
the <b>Granma</b> and the Sierra Maestra warfare, perhaps I am not too
wrong if I put their cost at 300,000 US dollars. So, we can score another
point to our favor and say that we carried out the cheapest revolution
ever. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am being very candid with you. Yes, we
have stood in solidarity with the revolutionary movement. We have not denied
it. We may not tell the enemy what we do not want for it to know but we
never tell lies. That is for sure, we never tell lies to them, to journalists
or to anybody. That is an invariable principle.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was telling you about the [Missile] Crisis.
We knew that the Americans had some missiles in Turkey and Italy, medium-range
missiles which are faster than strategic missiles and bombers. There is
no doubt that the presence of 42 missiles here gave the Soviets a certain
strategic balance. So, for us, who received weapons, support and even the
hope that they might fight for us, no matter how much we wanted to preserve
a certain image of the Revolution, it was not fair, it was not honorable
to refuse an agreement on the question of medium-range missiles. Actually,
for us it would have been better to run the risk of not having them, although
based on what we know today, the invasion was a sure thing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By that time, the number of weapons and
trained people we had was considerable. We would have been a Vietnam and
paid a very high price.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Why did the attack not take place? The
Soviet thesis proved its value. We received additional news but we did
not pay attention because we were used to such hazards. We had no fear
of imperialism or anything like it and we had the experience of our war
which was short but intense, therefore, it was the best of schools to enrich
that experience. The Soviets were fully convinced, a conviction that could
not come out of the blue, without access to documents or other sensitive
sources of information.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Looking back at those times, I see that
the recommendations to fabricate a pretext date from March 9, 1962.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is known that the Soviets had some friends
or sympathizers in many US institutions taking part in meetings with a
lot of people, meetings resulting in lots of papers. They had them. At
that time, as I said, we did not know of these documents. But, carefully
recalling the story of the contacts, the first time they told us about
it, the envoys that came to Cuba, who they were and what they talked about,
what they said and how they said it, and the way in which we analyzed it,
I do not have any doubts that what they knew came from very reliable sources.
I discussed the problem with the revolutionary leadership. In those days
Che, Ra&uacute;l and other comrades were the main leaders, we analyzed
it and made a decision.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Soviets asked me a question, I should
say it. They asked me: "What do you think would prevent this invasion?"
I told them, and I still believe it: "A Soviet declaration stating that
an attack on Cuba would be tantamount to an attack on the Soviet Union."
They said: "Yes, yes. But how do we make it plausible?" That was when they
suggested deploying the missiles. Then we started thinking and analyzing
among ourselves, and we analyzed it from the angle I told you, in terms
of honor and solidarity. The answer was "Yes". That was weeks after instructions
had been given to fabricate the pretext for an invasion.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have to reconstruct that story a bit,
inquire about some facts and dates. I already told you about this --I was
only going to read what I had here-- and be more precise. Because the moment
we signed an agreement on that, we began working really fast. So, by August
Kennedy had accepted the plan, adopted the plan and said: "It's a matter
of urgency.'"</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We probably prevented a direct invasion
at that time. Later, there were rumors of movements of arms and ships,
and so on. In July and August there were some rumors because the missiles
were arriving --land-to-air missiles-- and a large amount of weapons, modern
planes and many other things. The Crisis began after October 20, really.
The Soviets were absolutely right. Jrushov was absolutely right. But such
certainty as he had would not have been possible without access to the
documents and activities in which the Unites States was engaged. And they
had many more resources than we did to obtain that information.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We had some hard information, enough I
think and, above all, intuition, we outguessed them. On the other hand,
we had a rule: An attack should never take us by surprise. It is better
to mobilize twenty times, even if nothing happens, than not mobilizing
once and be attacked. We might say that a mobilized troop or country is
20-25 times stronger than when taken by surprise.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That was what happened to the Soviets in
June 1941. That happened to Stalin, when he behaved like an ostrich, sticking
his head into a hole while the Germans concentrated 3 million troops near
the border, tens of thousands of vehicles, thousands upon thousands of
tanks, thousands upon thousands of planes. They attacked on a Sunday, when
many officers and soldiers were on leave and they destroyed almost every
plane on the ground. That story is incredible and we know it very well
because we have read a lot about that war and it has helped enrich our
experience in many fields.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was only when the Americans decided
to declassify these documents that we learned the details of those sinister
plans and their unbelievable lack of scruples. One of those people said:
"I don't know anything. You must be prepared to swear that I don't know
anything about it." Another one recommended shameful ways to fabricate
pretexts to justify a war. The other one accepted. All this is useful today.
Other documents will be declassified because there is this procedure, and
that has been a contribution --as I was saying-- the declassified documents,
in addition to all the evidence we have. Something like the Bay of Pigs
is definitely easy to prove. But there is a whole story, from the first
to the last man recruited, who did it, where he was sent, the weapons he
was given. We took 1,200 prisoners here and swapped them for baby food
and medicine. That was the compensation they paid.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Through the declassification process they
have put in our hands documents, precedents and facts. Now, we are engaged
in this legal battle. I hope that they do not invade us because they consider
it a global threat.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I can certainly speak of another global
threat, namely, ideas. Clear ideas, all that you have analyzed and adopted.
We should all help globalize ideas, help them expand. We should all work
the miracle of sending them everywhere, as I said the first day. Those
are indeed global threats: speaking, reasoning, thinking, explaining, showing.
If in your opinion I have been too extensive, in my opinion I have not.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It has been a pleasant experience to discuss
all this with you, and I have told you a number of things, many of which
I have exposed for the first time. I have done it with great pleasure,
with great satisfaction. It is the least I can do for the honor of your
visit, because you have come without any fears and under certain circumstances
you need to be brave to come and visit us. I am talking to the Congress
delegates. I am talking too --although it is not the same situation-- to
the Ministers. Ministers are more powerful, therefore, less vulnerable
than you.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For the spirit of friendship we have seen,
for your honesty and solidarity it has been a great satisfaction to speak
to you for I do not know how many hours --I can hardly estimate the number--
but I can assure you that if I started talking at 5:00 p.m., it is still
far from the record. (LAUGHTER) I hope it can be useful!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thank you (OVATION).</font>
