OF THE REPUBLIC OF CUBA, TO REPRESENTATIVES OF BRAZIL’S NATIONAL STUDENTS
UNION. BELO HORIZONTE, BRAZIL. JULY 1, 1999.</font></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><b>Dear friends,</b>
<p><b>I have no idea if the sound system is working. Is it working? (SOMEBODY
SAYS SOMETHING) I have another doubt: whether or not you can understand
my Spanish (exclamations) because if the sound system is not working and
I cannot communicate with you, then what am I doing here?</b>
<p><b>Allow me to begin by saying that I will not be able to make the speech
that I might have liked. Actually, I should not say speech because I do
not usually give speeches but rather converse with the audience. (applause
and exclamations) I really had to make a great effort and use my imagination
to figure out what this place would be like, whether it would be suited
to reflection.</b>
<p><b>I see you sitting on the floor, very elegantly, if I may say so but
I had thought there would be chairs here. I had forgotten that the Brazilian
Students Union lacks the resources to rent chairs. Not long ago, I spoke
to the students of Venezuela at the Aula Magna of a university where there
were around 1200 students, and a few thousand outside... What is it over
there? Can they not hear? (Laughter and applause) Actually, it was a very
different place from this; I do not like stadiums for rallies and ceremonies.
Anyway, I will leave aside things I could have said here today and try
to make my remarks short. As you know, I have a reputation for talking
extensively.</b>
<p><b>We arrived late but not because we planned it so, rather because
of activities that came up and prevented us from being here at three in
the afternoon. It's now five o'clock passed and on top of that there is
an important soccer game, so I must definitely be brief.</b>
<p><b>I sent ahead two batches of 5000 booklets. One contains the speech
I gave to the Venezuelan students at the National University 40 years after
my first visit to that same place. There, I tried to deal in depth with
many issues concerning our hemisphere and our world. I do not need to repeat
them I will only ask that, when you do not have anything else to do, you
do us the honor of reading it. The other booklet contains the speech given
less than a month ago at a cultural Congress attended by around 1000 delegates,
close to 700 of them foreigners. I do not have to repeat the things I said
there because you will all get a copy.</b>
<p><b>I brought a few papers here with me but I practically will not need
them: a few documents, the speech I gave at the Summit --a very short one
lasting only three and a half minutes-- and another one that lasted around
seven minutes, no more. One comrade made reference to the matter.</b>
<p><b>Now, I would like to know... (explosions are heard) Are those bombs?
Is it the prelude to a NATO intervention? What are those explosions? (Laughter)
What I want to know is what you would like me to talk about or explain
to you. (Exclamations) I need someone to translate what is being said.
Very well, then you do it, you have a good ear and you know "Brazilian".
(hE IS TOLD that they are greeting him and voicing their support)</b>
<p><b>First of all, I should say that it is to be assumed that you have
a million questions about your country, about Latin America and the Caribbean,
and about the world. I neither can, nor should, answer the questions about
your country because I am a guest here, a visitor who must abide by the
strict rule of not voicing judgements about the country.</b>
<p><b>To help you understand, I should explain that I was very pleased
to learn that only 24 hours after the famous Summit a Congress of Brazilian
students would be held. Also, that thousands of delegates from all of the
country's universities would attend and that you were doing me the immense
honor of extending an invitation to participate, if only for a few minutes.
From the very first moment I was full of enthusiasm, joy, pride and hope
for your interest in having me here (applause) and I was determined to
do everything possible to come.</b>
<p><b>It is interesting to note the two events taking place. One of them
brought together 48 heads of state and government: approximately one-third
of them Latin Americans, another one-third Europeans and a similar number
of Caribbean heads of government. What a great thing! For the first time,
Caribbeans and Latin Americans were meeting because the Caribbean nations
are usually forgotten. They were the lasts to achieve independence; when
the Revolution triumphed in Cuba, hardly any of them was independent. It
has been only in the last 30 years that, one by one, they have attained
the status of independent countries.</b>
<p><b>When Latin America severed ties with Cuba, and we were left completely
alone as we were expelled from the OAS –and we shall always be grateful
for that (applause)-- the Caribbean nations did not belong to the OAS since
they were not independent states. Later, as free nations together with
the Panamanians led by Torrijos, they waged the battle to break Cuba’s
isolation. Thus, step by step, relations between Cuba and the rest of Latin
America were resumed with few exceptions. Such exceptions, nonetheless,
have either an Interest Section or certain ties with Cuba.</b>
<p><b>Today, the Caribbean nations --as independent states-- are Cuba's
closest and most consistent friends, (applause) that is why we were so
pleased with a Summit where they would be taking part. Yes, there have
been other summits, two actually: the so-called Summits of the Americas,
to which we are not invited because, apparently, we do not live on Earth.
But, we were invited to this Summit.</b>
<p><b>Previously, Mexico had invited us to a Latin American Summit held
for the first time without the United States participation. The Mexicans
firmly resisted the pressures and gave a small space to the hemisphere’s
Cinderella, that is, Cuba. We have been there ever since.</b>
<p><b>This time it meant the opportunity for participation by the Caribbeans,
Latin Americans and Europeans --not from all of Europe but the 15 members
of the European Union. It was, unquestionably, a very important meeting
because, really, there are contradictions between the interests of the
Europeans and those of the United States.</b>
<p><b>The United States wants to swallow up all of Latin America and the
Caribbean through the so-called FTAA --the Free Trade Agreement of the
Americas. As I already said, Cuba has been left out despite strong opposition
from the Caribbeans and some resistance, more or less strong, from some
Latin American countries.</b>
<p><b>In my view, this was a significant meeting, given the fact that those
Europeans who want to be independent met with those of us in Latin America
and the Caribbean who also want to be independent.</b>
<p><b>Somebody here --I think that clever and enthusiastic young man--
voiced some criticisms of the meeting, and I would agree with any criticism
because I have made some awfully strong criticisms myself. It is not that
I have criticized the meeting but rather certain concepts and events presently
developing in the world.</b>
<p><b>There is a story behind the point that he made about the Helms-Burton
Act. Our delegation, after analyses and exchanges with the Latin Americans,
had drafted a paragraph –one that, curiously enough, was accepted by the
Europeans-- stating that they were opposed to all extraterritorial legislation
or actions, especially, or more or less, like the Helms-Burton Act. But,
these documents issued at Summits only come after hard labor particularly
when there are conflicting interests, and there were many.</b>
<p><b>For example, the Europeans firmly and unanimously opposed any mention
of defense of the United Nations Charter, any reference to condemning intervention
in other countries, any indication of defense of the national sovereignty.
National sovereignty, the right to non-intervention and self-determination,
that is, a paragraph that contained what were and still today are for the
immense majority of the world --perhaps today more than ever-- sacred,
vital and non-negotiable rights. (Applause)</b>
<p><b>It was a source of concern. We left Cuba on Sunday. The foreign ministers
conference was beginning on Sunday and the Summit on Monday. Those matters
were being discussed in the so-called experts meetings. There, they had
come to agree on a number of things: the demand by several Latin American
countries of a paragraph in which reference to the Helms-Burton Act was
maintained --and here there are two different things but very closely associated.
Our expert at the meeting, the deputy minister of Foreign Relations, tried
hard for the reference to the Helms-Burton Act to remain clearly stated.
But, at the same time, there was the righteous demand raised by other countries
for the line in question not to refer solely to the Helms-Burton Act. Actually,
the paragraph stated, more or less literally, the extraterritorial nature
of legislation with an impact on trade, such as the Helms-Burton Act.</b>
<p><b>That night, they did not reach full agreement. On Sunday morning,
they had a formula: the Europeans accepted a line on the issue but in a
broader concept, that is, against all forms of extraterritoriality, although
they took advantage of the situation and removed the specific reference
to the Helms-Burton Act. The matter had been left pending until Sunday.
On Saturday, at a quarter to midnight, we were informed by our foreign
minister already in Rio that Europe had accepted a paragraph clearly stating
the following:</b>
<p><b>"This strategic partnership is based on full compliance with international
law, and the purposes and principles contained in the Charter of the United
Nations, the principles of non-intervention, respect for sovereignty, equality
among States, and self-determination."</b>
<p><b>It was simply left pending whether or not the name of the Helms-Burton
Act would be there. We analyzed the matter because the foreign ministers
meeting was to begin and no agreement had been reached on this. Upon arrival
we told our representatives: "At this point in time, to have a paragraph
on non-intervention, sovereignty and the rest is a great success. Whether
or not Mr. Helms and Mr. Burton’s names are mentioned is not important,
all the more so when this line condemns all extraterritorial attempts."
I also said: "Forget about these two gentlemen who are not worthy of mention
in a document like this. They are by now sufficiently discredited. We are
not going to begin the Summit meeting, where so many things are to be discussed,
with the issue of a minor point in which the only thing argued is whether
or not the names of these two gentlemen should appear."</b>
<p><b>A few press dispatches have reported that Cuba was defeated, embittered,
and so on, but the truth is really the opposite. We were pleased because
the key issue, the strategic issue was the paragraph that the Europeans
did not want to include under any circumstances related to non-intervention,
respect for sovereignty, etc. That is the story of this issue.</b>
<p><b>Cuba's positions have been strengthened and I say it in all sincerity.
Many of the issues included were Cuban initiatives endorsed by many Latin
American countries. A number of them are very sensitive to the idea of
NATO and the United States having the right to launch bombs and missiles
at any moment, on any day, under any pretext, against cities, industries
and worse still, citizens, the population of the country. (Applause)</b>
<p><b>You may rest assured that our very distinguished neighbors in the
North did not want this meeting to take place, nor are they very pleased
with the meeting and its results, even if these may have fallen short of
satisfying all of our hopes. I would say that, in this case, our expectations
were met because we were aware that we could not expect more from a meeting
with these characteristics. However, I understand that millions and millions
of people with significant and fair concerns may not feel satisfied with
such a document which, in my view, should be taken as a first step.</b>
<p><b>Anyway, I took advantage of the occasion to hold discussions with
a number of European leaders. I also had to make a strong, difficult and
in a way audacious speech. I simply dropped a small but powerful bomb touching
on two or three sensitive issues. Some say that the tension was so thick
in the air that you could cut it with a knife. At the end, I was under
the impression that an icy wind had blown in the room. Almost at the end
of the session, after careful thinking, I decided that it was my duty to
address the issue for which I only had four minutes. Then, after my statement
the President of Brazil, whose turn it was to chair the meeting at that
moment, immediately said: "This important and sensitive issue should be
discussed in the heads of delegations private meeting." All members do
not attend such meeting but only the heads of state and government so as
to speak more extensively on various subjects. He said it as soon as I
had finished speaking and then reiterated it at the end of the meeting,
before the private session began.</b>
<p><b>There were 15 European leaders at the meeting, 11 of them NATO members.
What did I do? Well, there had been a declaration and a solemn commemoration
in Washington on April 24 last, a month after the outset of the butchery
and genocide in Yugoslavia. It was NATO’s Declaration of Principles made
with a baseless but obvious euphoria because they believed that three days
of bombings would suffice, the less optimistic thought of five. However,
a month later the Serbian people continued to resist... Take heed that
when I say the Serbian people I mean millions of men and women, children
and old people but especially children, pregnant women, civilians completely
innocent of any crime, unless it were a crime their capacity for martyrdom,
the courage to die and the determination to continue singing patriotic
anthems or happy songs, like you, while protecting with their bodies the
crucial bridges connecting the two parts of the capital city.</b>
<p><b>We had three diplomats there, three comrades with one cell telephone
who communicated with our country every day. I usually asked them one single
question: What is the mood of the population under the bombings? And I
was amazed by the answer: "They are still putting on their concert at such
and such a time, every day, and thousands of people participate. The people
have an incredibly high morale."</b>
<p><b>We were not thinking about the government because we can neither
certify nor deny the accusations made against the Yugoslavian government.
That is, the ethnic cleansing that have taken place on both sides ever
since Europe irresponsibly disassembled Yugoslavia where throughout 45
years and despite their national, religious, cultural and ethnic differences
those peoples had lived in peace.</b>
<p><b>When the West, mostly Europe, disintegrated Yugoslavia there began
the wars and mutual slaughters among peoples who had constituted the Yugoslavia
that lived in peace for almost half a century. (Applause)</b>
<p><b>As I have told several European leaders, no ethnic cleansing and
no crime can justify genocide against a nation of millions of innocent
people (applause and exclamations) and that is why we advocated a political
solution to the problem. Any day in the future certain messages might be
made public which were sent to various places. We had realized, from the
very beginning, the enormous mistake and predicted quite accurately what
would happen as, in fact, it did until the day when overwhelming pressures
forced the government of that country to accept the conditions set by NATO,
under the hypocritical label of a political solution that consisted of
caving in to all of the attackers' demands.</b>
<p><b>No pressures can excuse the decisions made by governments, certainly
not. I can assure you that Cuba, a country that for many years has lived
in constant danger of such things and even worse, has been determined to
resist and has resisted for 40 years. If one day a deluge of bombs were
to fall on our small island, I am certain that our people would be as heroic
as the Serbs have been. (applause) Also, as we said recently, we would
not need mediators who would only be received when the attackers sent a
message admitting their defeat and announcing their withdrawal from the
country or the cease of the attacks. (APPLAUSE)</b>
<p><b>A government can accept, or refuse to accept, pressures. We know
very well what the leaders of our country would do if one day we could
no longer withstand the pain of seeing how much is destroyed, or the pain
of seeing how much is sacrificed. Although we believe that there is nothing
more sacred than freedom, that there is nothing more sacred than dignity.
What is a man or a woman without dignity? What is a man or a woman without
freedom, without a homeland, without the will to sacrifice everything?</b>
<p><b>More than one nation in history has done precisely that rather than
folding up their banners or giving in to the demands of their brutal aggressors.
In such cases, there is always a simple and easy solution, which is heading
out to where the bombs are falling and die beneath the bombing. This is
the only alternative that, based on our conceptions and our values, would
correspond to the leaders who have adopted the decision to fight at any
cost.</b>
<p><b>In fact, the Serbs could not have lost more than they already had;
they could not have suffered more destruction than they already had. They
had nothing left to lose. I am simply expressing a point of view; we are
not criticizing anyone.</b>
<p><b>More than once in my life revolutionaries have come to tell me: "There
is a possibility of peace. We have this or that alternative." I have always
answered --in specific circumstances, mainly after the collapse of the
socialist bloc-- "It is up to you." You can never advise someone to negotiate
or to die; you only can persuade yourself that you must die. "We will respect
any decision you make; we would know, without the least hesitation, what
we would do under the same circumstances." It is a matter of philosophy,
of concepts. That is why it was a very important issue.</b>
<p><b>That day at the Summit I presented, in two pages, four points and
three questions --I am not going to read them. Four points out of 16 we
had selected from the April 24 NATO statement proclaiming the right to
global intervention, and just three questions, but one had to do with the
European Union declaration made here on sovereignty and so on. I asked
them --and this will be the only question I will read: "Does this mean
that the United States is also committed to respect the principles contained
in this declaration endorsed by its allies? What would the European reaction
be if under just any pretext the United States unilaterally decided to
unleash an attack with bombs and missiles against any of the Latin American
and Caribbean countries meeting here?"</b>
<p><b>That was one question, I do not know if it was the $64,000 question
as people usually say. But, there were two other similar questions. There
for the first time I touched on the problem of the proliferation of nuclear
weapons supported by the United States, tolerated and kept in secret --a
strange and hermetic secret-- for years in the case of a Middle East country
in possession of about 300 nuclear weapons. That would be one of the cases
where, according to NATO and its new concept, an armed intervention could
be carried out.</b>
<p><b>I asked them if one day they would, perhaps, drop thousands of bombs
on that country and its cities, on that country and its population formed
by various ethnic groups. Also, whether it was civilized to apply such
formulae to solve the problem. And, of course, I firmly stated that it
would be criminal if due to this proliferation they had supported, they
would one day undertake a genocidal war against the men and women, the
children and the elderly in that country.</b>
<p><b>I will say no more. I will not call names. Three questions and not
one answer. In that private meeting, no European representative raised
his hand to say: "I would like to answer the questions raised by the Cuban
leader." Not even one.</b>
<p><b>I had an arsenal of papers with me. I kept a respectful silence and
waited all through the meeting for someone to speak on the issues for which
the chairman twice asked for answers. Those were " the three unanswered
questions."</b>
<p><b>I should add, comrades, that there are quite a few unanswered questions
in the world. There was, for example, the Serbian holocaust at the time
the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia. There were concentration camps like Dachau
and Oswiecim where, together with other camps and other forms of death,
675,000 Serbian men, women and children were simply annihilated. The West
has said nothing about that.</b>
<p><b>If you want truths, regardless of your political philosophies or
party affiliation, I tell you that there are quite a few questions and
quite a few answers that merit clarification even if it is only to expose
hypocrites, to destroy hypocrisy and to make the world aware of today's
realities. Those will be our means to build that world you all hope for.</b>
<p><b>I listened to what was said here about Brazil and the unity of all
Brazilians for building the nation of your dreams. I say that this is not
the time to be thinking about our own nations; we must think in terms of
the Latin American and Caribbean nation (APPLAUSE) which is also represented
here by OCLAE.</b>
<p><b>The time is coming for thinking about the world as a single nation.
The time is coming for thinking about the world because this world has
definitely globalized under one single superpower and in favor of a unipolar
world, not to save it but to destroy it. (Applause) It is not to bring
about the justice we all need but to enslave us even more if it were possible
and to plunder us even more if it were feasible. It is to humiliate us
even more, to remove our unmovable dreams (Applause) and to obliterate
the cultures we must preserve and multiply because unity does not mean
the end of our cultures. Unity, integration and justice mean the possibility
of preserving everything we love. Cultures and nations will always exist
even if we reach the highest degree of unity or disintegration.</b>
<p><b>We dream of a world not ruled by a false single universal culture
(Applause) but rather where all cultures survive and develop; a world where
all languages survive and develop, even if we make up some new ones, or
use others, or confiscate some if the need be because a language may serve
a good or a bad cause. English, for example, the national language of the
super-empire, currently serves a bad cause; but English, just like Spanish,
French and any of the other more commonly used languages could be put at
the service of a good cause.</b>
<p><b>For example, Karl Marx spoke German but he did not use it for the
same purpose as Adolph Hitler. He used it to defend a fair, brotherly and
humane world. And many Americans use English to defend just causes.</b>
<p><b>All languages should survive! Out of 6000 or 7000 languages in the
world, some 2000 have been lost in recent years and it has been estimated
that in the next 20 years, another 2000 will be lost. When a dialect is
lost it is human spiritual wealth that loses and history, our history as
human beings, the history of how we evolved from animals into humans. Sometimes,
however, I think that there are many animals that have never known slavery,
capitalism nor the exploitation of animals by animals, which often behave
better than humans do. (Applause)</b>
<p><b>All these elements are part of our history, of our civilization and
they will be the pillars of our culture when this neoliberal and unsustainable
globalization is sunk. And it will sink, in the words of Salvador Allende,
rather sooner than later. (Applause)</b>
<p><b>Prevailing conditions in the world today make this infamous order
we are enduring unsustainable. That is why we believe that the most important
task is sowing ideas, building awareness so that when that world collapses
humankind will be in a better position to rise on its ruins a better world,
a more humane globalization.</b>
<p><b>It was not only Karl Marx who dreamed of globalization. Perhaps,
he was the first to conceive a developed world where the developed productive
forces would be able to produce the material and spiritual goods that men
and women required. Of course, this does not mean changing automobiles
every year nor owning three, five or ten palaces or a man with 90 billion
dollars in a country that considers itself a model and an example of democracy
living just a few miles from a bridge under which the many poor in that
same country still sleep covered with newspapers. (ApPlause)</b>
<p><b>Let’s speak of justice, freedom and human rights where there is equality,
respect for everyone, culture for everyone because without culture there
cannot be freedom, without culture you cannot even be a democrat. (Applause)</b>
<p><b>What democracy are they talking about when there are millions and
millions of people who cannot even read or write and when millions of children
die because at a given moment they do not have access to a vaccine or to
oral rehydration salts worth pennies? What human rights are they talking
about when every year their system kills tens of millions of people of
hunger, poverty and lack of medicine, shelter, clothing, shoes? I repeat
that tens of millions die every year.</b>
<p><b>There are some that honestly oppose capital punishment, even in cases
of monstrous crimes that are unfortunately committed. Even in cases of
the repulsive raping of five, six or seven-year old boys and girls by people
responsible for these children.</b>
<p><b>Our country is one of the 129 nations where capital punishment is
still enforced. They say we have tightened our criminal code because two
crimes that inflict great social and human damage will receive more severe
sanctions –more years in prison or a life sentence, as an intermediate
step. More severe sentences are prescribed for intolerable and disgusting
serious crimes, and when I say intolerable and disgusting serious crimes
I do not mean so to governments but rather to the people who are filled
with terror when they learn of such monstrosities. That is because in our
country, under specially tense conditions, with a double blockade and new
legislation to tighten it --of which the Helms-Burton Act is just another
instance-- with new amendments added everyday to increase the blockade
and its impact, we are left with no other option.</b>
<p><b>In our country there is much more freedom for millions of people
to come and go</b>
<br><b>--many of them without a visa-- because today tourism is a crucial
need for our economy, but not gambling and casino tourism, or sex tourism.
Such things are not acceptable to us and we are not willing to tolerate
them because all the gold in the world is not worth more than a woman’s
dignity and, even more so, a teenage girl's dignity. (Applause) Selling
minors to foreigners for sex or the removal of their organs is severely
punished. The grotesque and repulsive raping of boys and girls with aggravating
circumstances is inadmissible.</b>
<p><b>Large-scale drug trafficking is also punished with the death sentence.
These are the two instances because today there is more freedom to move
around and foreign investments --those indispensable-- and some joint ventures.
There have also been those who have tried to use these companies as facades
to receive containers of raw materials and reship them full with products
of small industries carrying in inside walls significant amounts of drugs.
And we have said: "No! Our country cannot tolerate such an outrage." These
are the conditions, different from those in Europe or many European countries,
in which we have the primary duty of defending our people.</b>
<p><b>Capital punishment is more disgusting to us than it is to many who
fight it. Yes, it is true, we find it disgusting. We are terribly hurt
that poverty, the lack of education, marginality and other phenomena of
the world we live in may lead certain human beings to commit such monstrous
acts.</b>
<p><b>I have told several people, many of them our friends who out of religious
or philosophical convictions --and I respect their principles and ideas--
do not accept capital punishment, and to others who do not accept it and
fight it sometimes with the purpose of using it as a banner of humanism
--and some of them are very rich, extraordinarily rich-- and I tell them:
We hurt by the things that happen. We hurt by capital punishment but there
is more than one type of capital punishment.</b>
<p><b>Several hundreds or thousands people are sentenced every year under
laws punishing crimes with this sentence. But, we should not wait for the
world to have changed that much so that there is not a single country including
the death sentence in its legislation. We should not wait that long to
save millions of lives because there is another terrible kind of capital
punishment. I am thinking of those millions, those tens of millions of
people sentenced to death every year, most of them children, by the social
system you enjoy and defend, I say. (Applause)</b>
<p><b>As I also said at the Summit: "We shall defend sovereignty as something
sacred while some are very weak and others very powerful and while not
everybody is willing to relinquish it in favor of universal sovereignty."
And right away I asked a question: "There are certainly neither superior
nor inferior races; why then are the Latin American and Caribbean nations
poor and underdeveloped? Whose fault is it? Perhaps the Hero Children of
Chapultepec, the millions of natives exterminated in this hemisphere, or
the slaves who died in shackles throughout the centuries would have an
answer to these questions." (Applause)</b>
<p><b>That is why I was telling you that we know how many children die
in every part of this hemisphere, in every part of Africa and the world.
It is hard to think that while some rich and developed countries --which
built their wealth with our natural resources, and worse still, with the
blood of the people living in these places, with the sweat and blood of
our countries-- continue to enjoy this shameful development, there are
among our countries those where the infant mortality rate is 200 per 1,000
live births in the first five year.</b>
<p><b>Since we know of very rich countries where infant mortality rate
is 6 per 1000, it hurts a lot to think that, on the threshold of the next
century, there are countries where 40 children die for every one dying
in developed countries. Thanks to our experience, our solidarity with the
Third World where 26,000 Cuban doctors have worked throughout the last
30 or 40 years, we know how much it costs to save a child and how a child
can be saved. We have told them: "If you provide the minimum inexpensive
medicine needed, we are willing to send thousands of doctors, like those
we are sending to Central America, to Haiti, to Africa."</b>
<p><b>We have identified a group of countries with the highest infant mortality
rate in Sub-Saharan Africa and offered them up to 3000 doctors. Doctors
with a humanitarian concept of medicine who are willing to go to the most
remote places with exemplary stoicism, with the spirit of martyrs, really,
because they have been educated with that consciousness. We have said to
them: "Let’s not wait until human beings no longer die by virtue of some
law or court ruling to save, right now, millions of children and millions
of people who could be saved every year." We have also said that if out
of every three Cuban doctors one would go to this type of mission, the
other two would do the third doctor’s job, and we would still be the country
with the highest number of doctors per capita in the world, including overdeveloped
countries. (Applause)</b>
<p><b>One of the comrades here, the Uruguayan, spoke about the Latin American
Medical School that we recently established, practically in a matter of
weeks, after the hurricanes that first hit the Dominican Republic and Haiti
and then the huge hurricane that hit Central America. We not only offered
the doctors needed to go to the most difficult places --where no other
doctors go-- but also a school to train doctors. There are already 1800
students there and next year there will be about 3000. But that is not
our only facility; that is for studying the first two years, the most difficult
ones. Later, they will go to the other medical schools --we have 21 of
them-- because they start working in teaching hospitals, that is, our doctors
receive not only theoretical training but hands-on training, too.</b>
<p><b>Each of those doctors may become a trainer of nurses. Taking their
medical texts back to their countries, all they need is for the future
nurses to have a sixth grade level and each can train two or three of them,
thus increasing the number of nurses. These nurses need not be university
graduates, as it is the case in our country today, because these are formula
devised to cope with the problems on short-term bases.</b>
<p><b>What a coincidence when he said there were Latin American students
there! In fact, right now there are a large number of Central American
students there because we offered them 500 scholarships annually. We also
offered scholarships to almost all the Latin American countries.</b>
<p><b>For some countries this is important; for a small country such as
Bolivia, 70 scholarships annually mean something; for a small country such
as Honduras, 300 scholarships mean even more; for Guatemala, or Nicaragua,
or Haiti from where we have already received 120 students. There are students
from other countries, too. They have come from Ecuador and even from Argentina,
Chile and Brazil.</b>
<p><b>What did we do in Brazil's case, it being such a big country? What
good would 60 or 70 scholarships do to Brazil? We asked our Brazilian friends
to choose two or three students from each state, not because Brazil needs
it but because the school needs it. Because we want that school to become
a center of Latin American brotherhood. We want that school to promote
a doctrine of what human health care should be like (Applause) and of what
a doctor should be like.</b>
<p><b>At a certain point, I realized that considering that some countries
already have a fair number of doctors, we had not included them --one of
these was Uruguay. I immediately asked the Uruguayans, the young students
and solidarity groups, if they could choose at least 50 students and send
them to Cuba. It was not because they might need it so much; perhaps they
might not need it at all. It is not a country of jungles or out of the
way places; most people there live in the capital and we know that the
problems are not in the capital. I said that we were not offering doctors
but begging them –and begging you as OCLAE-- to help us, so that there
are students from every single country of Latin America and the flags of
all these countries can be hoisted in that school.</b>
<p><b>We are not creating capacity for 3000 students because within four
years there will be 6000 Latin American students studying in Cuba, who
will later serve the cause of human health and human life, like pastors,
missionaries or priests.</b>
<p><b>Cuba is a poor country under an increasingly tightened blockade.
But, although we abruptly lost the market for our sugar and other products,
our fuel supply, our credits and many other things, we have resisted for
10 years such blows, and we shall continue to resist, and we increase our
human capital by the year. That is what we have! And because we have that,
we can say what that immensely rich country cannot say even when its Gross
Domestic Product annually reaches ten trillion dollars --around six hundred
times as much as tiny Cuba.</b>
<p><b>I am sure that if it asks for volunteers to go where our doctors
have gone in Central America, in Haiti or in Africa, it would not pool
2000 doctors. I would venture further and say that together, the United
States and Europe could not pool 2000 doctors. Unquestionably, in those
countries there are a lot of good people but their life-style is very different
from those who live without electric power, medicines and doctors; who
do not have a computer, three TV sets, an automobile, a big residence,
and who do not shop in supermarkets via Internet without even bothering
to go out in the street. It would not bother me to be proven wrong on this.
If they could pool 10,000 I would be even happier. And if they could pool
20,000 I would invite them right away to send them and the indispensable
medicine, for we could inform them with almost mathematical accuracy the
number of lives they would save every year, the number of lives they would
save every year!</b>
<p><b>We could also tell them: If you are so humane then join other countries,
for Cuba knows how many it can send. And if they can pool 6000, we have
already offered 6000; if they can offer 10,000, all our doctors, nurses
and health technicians need is to hear about it and in less than a week
we would have 10,000. And if one out of every three were necessary, as
soon as they knew about it, encouraged by the struggle for a better world,
they would go. They would thus help humanize those who are immensely rich
and who feel rightly sorry --I really mean it, feel rightly sorry-- when
a dog starves, so that they can also feel infinitely sorry when they learn,
if they have not learned it yet, or when they become truly aware, that
millions and millions of human beings die every year because they do not
have the means that dog has to save themselves. (Applause)</b>
<p><b>Our country lives by values. It has resisted thanks to values, waging
not only economic battles but also battles against terrorism, against assassination
attempts.</b>
<p><b>Yesterday, I was telling the students at the University of Rio de
Janeiro that while working on the lawsuit filed against the United States
government, putting together documents and evidence, I learned something
I had not known for 40 years. That is, the number of plots to kill me,
directly organized by the CIA, or planned by groups created and trained
by the CIA to which it granted "independence". Also plots induced by the
CIA and imperialist propaganda: Six hundred and thirty-seven plots! Believe
me that I was amazed at those numbers. I hope that among the documents
we will be forwarding you --we have already included two-- we also send
you the lawsuit that Cuba has filed.</b>
<p><b>If you [ADDRESSING MEMBERS OF THE CHAIR] committed yourselves to
sending them, not to the two million students because we do not have enough
paper for that, but if the OCLAE, for example, needed a certain number
of copies in the corresponding languages to send these three booklets to
all the student leaders in Brazil and Latin America, we would be willing
to send them to you. Some topics I have not referred to here you can find
in those two speeches I mentioned and in the lawsuit that we have filed
against the United States for 181.1 billion dollars. It has been filed
in a court of law for the loss of 3478 lives and the 2099 survivors disabled
as a consequence of the mercenary aggressions and terrorist actions.</b>
<p><b>If you [ADDRESSING MEMBERS OF THE CHAIR] commit yourselves, we will
send those three so that you can send them to those present here who will
not receive them now and to others elsewhere.</b>
<p><b>Ricardo, I dream of the day when you can organize a Latin American
congress of student leaders. (Applause) If you do not have a place, you
can count on Cuba (Someone from the audience says next year in Havana)
anytime you want. What we need to do is carry forward a united struggle.
We have to work together to create a consciousness, to sow ideas.</b>
<p><b>Forgive me for keeping you seated or standing so uncomfortably for
so long. I am sorry if I have abused your time a little, I know there is
a soccer game tonight at 8:30 p.m.</b>
<p><b>I think that given the circumstances in which we have met I have
said quite a lot. Now, I beg you to excuse me and I thank you.</b>
<p><b>See you soon!</b>
<p><b>Ever onward till victory!</b>
<p><b>(Ovation)</b>
