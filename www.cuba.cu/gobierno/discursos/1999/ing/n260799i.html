<center><font face="Arial">STATEMENT ON DRUG TRAFFICKING MADE BY DR. FIDEL
CASTRO RUZ, PRESIDENT OF THE STATE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC OF CUBA, AT
THE CONMEMORATION OF JULY 26, 1999 IN CIENFUEGOS, CUBA.</font></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial">As you know, in June of 1989, our country was enmeshed
in the bitter legal proceedings of Case No. 1, resulting from several comrades’
irresponsible and inconceivable behavior. Some of them showed records of
unquestionable revolutionary merits and achievements. Nonetheless, they
placed at risk not only the prestige and the enormous moral authority acquired
over decades of heroic struggle by institutions as vital for the Revolution
as the Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Ministry of Interior, but also
the very security of the country. This was an unprecedented occurrence.
The media covered the fully transparent public trial. Never before had
a trial received so much publicity. The Council of State itself debated
the appeal before the television cameras that broadcast the event to the
country and the world. The viewpoints and rational of its 29 members were
expressed. The agreement was unanimous. It had to be an exemplary sanction,
and it was.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The situation created by the constant violations
of Cuban airspace was analyzed during the trial. The three air corridors
that cross over our long and narrow country are used daily by an average
of 277 aircraft operated by regular airlines or other aircraft currently
authorized when they comply with the prior request procedure. However,
there were frequent irregular flights, at low and medium altitudes, with
no prior notice or authorization whatsoever. This was precisely the way
the drug traffickers' aircraft operated.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As a rule, they disobeyed any order issued by the
air traffic authorities and avoided intercepting planes, even in broad
daylight, using widely known wing movements in the few minutes needed to
cross over the island from South to North. Once on the sea, they dropped
their poisonous drug packages within or outside the 12 miles jurisdictional
waters. A strong warning was called for.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On June 24, 1989, the Ministry of the Revolutionary
Armed Forces (MINFAR) issued a note on the subject of the country's air
corridors announcing the decision to shoot at any plane that illegally
entered our airspace and refused to obey orders to land for an inspection.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On June 25, the head of the United States Interests
Section (USIS) in Havana presented to the Cuban Foreign Ministry a note
in the form of a Non Paper. There it was stated that the US government
would gladly welcome any legitimate action by the Cuban government to prevent
drug trafficking within Cuba's national territory, jurisdictional waters
and airspace. At the same time, it expressed concern over the decision
to shoot at aircraft given the possibility of anyone failing to respond
to our orders due to errors, a lack of communication or some other difficulty.
They asked for moderation.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On June 25, the US Federal Aviation Administration
sent a message to the Cuban Civil Aviation Agency expressing concern over
the policy announced the previous day of shooting at suspicious aircraft
that did not comply with orders to land.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On June 26, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher,
while welcoming any legitimate action to prevent drug trafficking, called
on the Cuban government to take the necessary precautions and exercise
proper moderation to avoid the loss of innocent lives.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On June 27, the Foreign Ministry presented to the
USIS Note 1268 in which it reiterated Cuba's firm determination to step
up all possible measures to fight drug trafficking in the environs of Cuban
territory, including strict observance of international over-flight regulations
in accordance with Cuba's responsibility for its airspace.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On June 28, President Bush declared to <i>El Nuevo
Herald</i> that he considered it a right decision by the Cuban government
to bring officials linked to drug trafficking to trial.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In the end, the order could not be fulfilled, not
even to set an example. The reason is that even in daylight, the time it
takes to detect a violation by radar and transmit the information to an
air base from which an intercepting plane would then take off and be guided
towards the far-off point where a small target is moving, locate it with
its own radar, report what it sees and wait for orders is longer than the
time it takes the violator to cross the narrow national territory and enter
international waters.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Additionally, to avoid risks drug smugglers usually
fly by night at low altitudes, even over irregular terrain. The hundreds
of thousands of dollars they are paid for each flight make them practically
suicidal. Our Air Force has lost fighter planes and even lives while tracking
aircraft to intercept such violations. An intensive and permanent guard
service, day and night, would be ruinous; also, it would impose a tremendous
drain on manpower and equipment in peacetime. Besides, under the circumstances
there was a genuine risk of shooting down a plane of adventurers uninvolved
in drug trafficking.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On the other hand, the United States has technically
equipped aircraft with excellent communications specially designed to track
down and chase planes over international waters and throughout the width
and breadth of its immense territory, should they enter it, until the target
either drops its cargo or runs out of fuel and is forced to land.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The intrigues would soon begin.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In July 11, the head of the USIS was summoned by
the Cuban Foreign Ministry (MINREX) to receive the Note 1376, which disputed
statements made by US officials on alleged drug drops on Cuban territorial
waters that were not intercepted by Cuban forces. The Note specified the
details of the drops on July 7 and 8 and the efforts made by our forces
to locate and control them. The Note further stated that unless the United
States adopted a serious and constructive stance it would not be possible
to establish a sincere and effective cooperation. Likewise, it reiterated
that Cuba was willing to cooperate and waiting for concrete US government
proposals.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">- On July 20, the press reported that four senators
had sent a letter to the Commander-in- Chief requesting information on
the Ochoa case.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">- On July 24, Defense Secretary Richard Chenney declared
that what was happening in Cuba was more than a fight against corruption
and drug trafficking.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">- On July 25 and 26, hearings were held by the House
Working Group on International Drug Control and the Senate Subcommittee
on Terrorism, Drugs and International Operations. The US Administration
official at the hearings noted that Cuba had been asked for the results
of the investigation and reiterated several times that the US government
was interested in putting Cuba to the test on these matters.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">- On July 26, Deputy Foreign Minister Ricardo Alarc&oacute;n
denied that the United States had provided Cuba with any information over
the previous 18 months concerning Cuban government officials’ involvement
in drug trafficking.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">- On August 2, at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearings Attorney General Richard Thornburgh expressed doubts on the possibility
of cooperation with Cuba in fighting drug trafficking. He also said that
Cuba had ignored Washington's efforts to establish cooperation.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">- Also on August 2, Vice President Dan Quayle said
he was intrigued by the announcement made by the Commander-in-Chief that
strict measures would be adopted against drug trafficking.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">- The August 7 edition of <i>Granma</i> included
an editorial which denounced the slandering campaign unleashed by the United
States on Cuba's alleged involvement in drug trafficking. The editorial
explicitly described Cuba's stance and its offer to cooperate with the
United States in these matters.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">- On August 17, at a Judicial Affairs Senate Committee
hearing a testifying Colombian drug smuggler tried to link Cuba to his
illegal activities.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">- On September 1, the Note 1694 was delivered to
the USIS in response to its Note 357 requesting cooperation in the arrest
and expulsion of 12 Colombian drug smugglers wanted in the United States.
In our Note, we expressed our acknowledgement of and gratitude for the
information passed on to us and reiterated that Cuba would never provide
refuge to drug smugglers and would consequently be on the alert. The Note
reiterated again Cuba's willingness to join efforts with the hemispheric
community in the fight against drug trafficking.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As you see, we are talking about something that happened
in 1989. Nonetheless, the various US administrations have never acceded
to considering a cooperation agreement between the two countries to fight
drug trafficking. Since then, however, Cuba has signed fruitful agreements
on the matter with 23 important countries in Latin America, Europe, Africa,
the Middle East and Asia and it cooperates with drug control agencies of
13 other countries with which agreements have yet to be signed.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ten years later, on May 25, 1999, <i>The</i> <i>Washington
Post</i>, a publication not usually friendly but rather critical of the
Cuban Revolution published two articles on Cuba's efforts to fight drug
trafficking signed by journalist Douglas Farah. The first article carries
the heading <b><i>"Cuba Wages a Lonesome Drug War"</i></b> and the subheading
<b><i>"Congressional
Stance Hampers US Role"</i></b>. It reads as follows:</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"CAYO CONFITES, Cuba -- On this sandy speck of
land off the northern coast of Cuba, the only line of defense against Colombian
drug traffickers bound for the United States consists of an aging Soviet-era
patrol boat, a British radar system with a six-mile range and 15 Cuban
soldiers.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"`We are seeing a systematic increase in the amount
of drugs dropped by air here, then picked up by fast boats and taken out
of our waters," said Col. Fredy Curbelo, an Interior Ministry official
who recently accompanied an American reporter on an unprecedented tour
of counter-drug installations in Communist-ruled Cuba. "Our Soviet launches
are 20 years old and can go 27 knots, while the drug traffickers can easily
go at 45 knots. We are doing what we can with our resources, but we are
limited in what we can do.'</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Notwithstanding Cuba's dire economic problems,
which were exacerbated after the collapse of its Soviet patron in 1989,
the government of President Fidel Castro is mounting what counter-drug
experts in Europe and the United States say is a serious if underfunded
effort to block the flow of illegal drugs through Cuba.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Castro's program has so impressed US law enforcement
officials that they would like to cooperate further with their Cuban counterparts,
who already have provided discreet assistance in several major cases. There's
just one problem: Some members of Congress, with backing from many Cuban
Americans, are dead set against any cooperation between Havana and Washington,
which have not had diplomatic relations since 1961.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"`From our point of view, the policy makes no
sense,' said a senior US law enforcement official. `We can't close off
the Caribbean [from drug traffic] without dealing with Cuba, and they have
shown a willingness to cooperate with us by acting on all the information
we pass on to them. It is a major hole that needs to be plugged.'</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Just 90 miles from Florida, Cuba is an ideal
transshipment point for illegal drugs bound for the United States, according
to US law enforcement officials, who estimate that about 30 percent of
the cocaine reaching the United States from Colombia passes through the
Caribbean. Yet for now, counter-drug cooperation is limited to information
exchanged on a case-by-case basis between the US Coast Guard and Cuba's
border guards via fax or an antiquated telex system.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"In contrast, counter-drug cooperation between
Cuba and such US allies as Britain, Spain, Colombia and France is growing.
Cuban officials said they would welcome increased cooperation with the
United States in fighting drug traffickers even in the absence of any progress
toward lifting the US economic embargo against the island nation.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"`You would think that if there were any area
in which we could work together, this would be it,' said Ricardo Alarc&oacute;n,
president of Cuba's legislative assembly and the government's point man
on relations with the United States. `It shows a lack of will by the United
States. Both sides would benefit from broader, systematic cooperation.'</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"Earlier this month,"</i> --he means the month
of May-- <i>"Barry R. McCaffrey, the Clinton administration's director
of national drug control policy, said the United States `probably ought
to be willing to encourage' dialogue with Cuban authorities on counter-drug
cooperation. But McCaffrey has been under attack by Cuban American lawmakers
and their allies in Congress, who have long contended that Castro's government
is not fighting drug smugglers but assisting them.</i></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"In a December 30, 1998 letter, House Republicans
Lincoln D&iacute;az-Balart (Florida), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Florida) and
Dan Burton (Indiana) demanded that McCaffrey address `the issue of the
Cuban government's participation in narcotrafficking and take all necessary
actions to end the Clinton administration's cover-up of that reality.'</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"In an angry response on January 28, McCaffrey,
a retired army general, said he was `insulted' by the tone of the letter,
`categorically' denied a cover-up, and said there is `no conclusive evidence
to indicate that Cuban leadership is currently involved in this criminal
activity.'</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Despite McCaffrey's comments and pleas from the
Justice Department, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Coast Guard,
there are no plans to improve the level of counter-drug cooperation between
the two countries, senior Clinton administration officials said. They added,
however, that in the absence of a formal agreement, the two countries could
continue to cooperate on a case-by-case basis. Anything more ambitious,
they said, would generate a political backlash in Congress and jeopardize
the informal channels between law enforcement agencies in Cuba and the
United States.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"`We are not saying we are not prepared to do
more with them at some point... but right now there is nothing being considered,'
said one administration official.</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"With 42,000 square miles of territorial waters
and 4,195 islands and small keys, Cuba is a smuggler's paradise," </i>the
journalist says. <i>"Most of the cocaine shipped through Cuba is dropped
by low-flying aircraft near uninhabited keys, where it is retrieved by
traffickers in speedboats. Those boats then ferry it to larger ships en
route to the United States or other destinations, such as Mexico, Haiti
and Jamaica.</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"David Ridgway, the British ambassador to Havana,
described anti-drug cooperation between his country and Cuba --including
$400,000 a year for training provided by Britain-- as `first class.' Cuba's
`political commitment is very strong,' he said in an interview in Havana.
`We are satisfied our money is well spent', </i>said the Ambassador, according
to the journalist.</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Thanks to British aid, airport immigration officials
can now run computer profiles of passengers to determine which ones are
likely to be involved in drug trafficking. Since 1994, when a Cuban tourism
boom began, 215 foreigners have been arrested on drug-trafficking charges.
Drug-sniffing dogs trained in France check luggage.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Anti-drug efforts are also focused on Cuba's
new free-trade zones, through which most goods are shipped without being
inspected, making them favorites of drug traffickers. Last December 3,
for example, Colombian police seized 7.7 tons of cocaine in Cartagena,
Colombia that was bound for Spain by way of Havana. Cuban and Colombian
authorities determined that the route had been used at least three times
before it was discovered.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Cuban authorities say they are motivated by a
desire to keep drug use from gaining a foothold on the island. For decades
after Castro's 1959 revolution, illegal drugs were virtually unknown in
Cuba. But in recent years, as the tourism boom has brought in outside influences
and US dollars, marijuana, cocaine and crack cocaine have begun to infiltrate
the island, authorities said.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"According to the Interior Ministry, Cuban authorities
discovered 30 loads of cocaine washed up on shore last year --compared
with 12 in 1994-- because traffickers missed their rendezvous points or
intentionally dumped their cargoes to avoid arrest. Authorities recovered
68 such loads in the first three months of this year.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"In a speech on January 5, Castro acknowledged
that drug trafficking is a growing problem, reported that 1,216 people
are in prison on drug-related charges and complained that some people had
been hiding drugs that wash ashore instead of turning them over to the
police."</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial">The second article by the same journalist was published
by the same newspaper in the US capital under the heading <b><i>"In This
Case, Cuba-US Teamwork Netted Big Score."</i></b></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">"HAVANA -- On October 1, 1996, US Coast Guard
officers watched in frustration as the Honduras-registered freighter Limerick
--sinking, abandoned and carrying a large quantity of cocaine-- drifted
into Cuban waters and seemingly out of their reach.</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>"Alerted by a Coast Guard request relayed through
British diplomatic channels, Cuban authorities hauled the ship to shore
and with help from US law enforcement agents" --</b>whom we actually invited--<i>
"discovered the hidden cargo, which they turned over to US authorities
for use in the trial of the ship's captain and crew. Cuban border guards
even flew to Miami to testify.</i></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"`They were really very cooperative,' said James
Milford, who was the DEA's deputy director at the time. `Any way you look
at it, they deserve a lot of credit.'</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"The United States continues to bar most trade
with Cuba, and the countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1961.
But law enforcement officials in both countries say the unprecedented level
of cooperation in the Limerick case shows political differences can be
set aside in pursuit of a common goal.</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"The case began when the Coast Guard, acting on
an intelligence tip, stopped the freighter in international waters north
of Cuba on suspicion that it was carrying two tons of cocaine." </i>It
should actually say south of Cuba, southeastern Cuba but that is how the
article reads. <i>"But as a Coast Guard party boarded the ship, the 11-man
crew tried to scuttle it, forcing the Coast Guard to evacuate the crew
and abandon the vessel.</i></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Using the British as intermediaries, the Coast
Guard asked the Cuban border patrol to try to salvage the 220-foot ship,
which had drifted into Cuban territory, was taking on water and was about
to sink, according to US, British and Cuban officials. The Cubans agreed
and towed the ship to shore.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Acting on US intelligence, Cuban authorities
began dismantling the ship and discovered a hidden cache of about two tons
of cocaine, according to Lt. Col. Oscar Garc&iacute;a, deputy commander
of Cuba's anti-drug police. The United States subsequently passed along
new intelligence indicating that even more cocaine might be concealed on
the ship, whose voyage had originated in Barranquilla, Colombia.</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"The Cubans agreed to let US Drug Enforcement
Administration and Justice Department officials join them"</i> –actually,
we invited them to participate-- <i>"in the first joint counter-drug operation
between the two countries, according to US and Cuban officials.</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"After spending two weeks dismantling the ship,
investigators from the two countries discovered six more tons of cocaine,
for a total haul of eight tons --one of the largest cocaine seizures in
history." </i>It was a bit less, as far as we recall, close to seven tons.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">That is essentially what the two <i>Washington Post</i>
articles reported.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">It should also be said that the Limerick case was
not the only one in which cooperation existed. Just a few weeks ago, Cuban
cooperation led to the seizure of the <i>China Breeze</i> in the Caribbean.
It was a vessel registered to the <i>Babuch-Mar&iacute;n Inc.</i> shipping
company that transported four tons of cocaine at the moment.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On May 28, 1999, near Cayo Confites, north of Camag&uuml;ey
province, the Cuban Border Patrol seized a speedboat coming to pick up
a drug shipment carried by a light plane forced to dump it outside the
established rendezvous point after being chased by a Cuban Air Force craft.
A total of 449 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On May 31 --less than two months ago-- Cuban cooperation
helped to capture the <i>Castor </i>motorboat on the high seas carrying
four tons of cocaine.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As a result of our country's drug interdiction efforts,
693 foreign drug smugglers were arrested between 1970 and 1999. Then, from
1970 to 1990 --a shorter period of time-- that is twenty years, 30 aircraft
and 73 seacrafts were confiscated; 84 of that total were registered in
the United States. Moreover, Cuba has never been a drug producer or exporter.
These are all drugs produced, exported and transported from other places.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In early June, barely two weeks after the <i>Washington
Post</i> articles, I met with a renowned and prestigious US Republican
lawmaker visiting Cuba. He impressed me as an experienced and serious man
with whom one could engage in an in-depth and frank conversation. For the
sake of discretion, I will rather not mention his name since I have not
consulted him on my saying this and I do not want to mix him up in this
debate. One of the main issues we addressed in our conversation was the
drug trafficking. I will mention only a few essential points from notes
on that conversation, although a great deal more was said about the subject.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">When he asked me whether Cuba and the United States
were presently working jointly in drug trafficking interdiction I answered:
"There is modest cooperation." When asked about the reason I frankly said
that for 40 years we had acted as the police in fighting drug trafficking
in the Caribbean. That this was not because anyone wanted to bring drugs
into Cuba but because for a long time we had had to defend ourselves from
pirate attacks, the infiltration of men, weapons and explosives and from
aircraft violating our airspace to drop bombs, flammable products, weaponry
or biological substances.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Whenever we could, I said, we forced them to land.
For many years in those days the pilots obeyed such orders. I do not remember
that we ever shot any of them down. But when the drug smugglers realized
that if they refused to obey no one shot at them, they stopped obeying.
When at times they had to land because of technical problems, we seized
them. That was how we intercepted many planes and especially many boats
trafficking with drugs. The crew was automatically arrested and brought
to justice in Cuba; no exceptions were made.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I explained to him the events tried in Case No. 1
that had been considered an act of treason because several of those involved
were high ranking officers in the Ministry of Interior and one of them
was an outstanding military officer highly decorated for his war merits.
Yet, they had taken part in the organization of drug trafficking through
our country, an extremely serious offense that jeopardized the prestige
and security of the nation.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I explained that we had found their justification
incredible since they said that they had concocted the plan to help the
country. They received 1000 dollars for every kilogram of drugs allowed
crossing. It was stupid to think or believe, in Cuba or abroad, that a
country importing eight billion dollars worth of goods a year could solve
any of its problems by collecting 1000 dollars for every kilogram of drugs
that crossed its territory. They helped in smuggling a total of about four
tons of drugs in two years before they were found out.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I told the visitor that even if drug smugglers had
delivered a billion or five billion dollars, if they had paid Cuba's foreign
debt, the Revolution would never accept the passage of even a kilogram
of drugs (APPLAUSE) because our country is worth much more. What it has
achieved in health, education and many other fields as a matter of sheer
justice with the sacrifice of many lives is worth much more than that amount;
that the life of just one person is worth much more, (APPLAUSE) and we
had had to sacrifice many lives.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I said to him that the most elementary logic indicated
that only a government of thieves and cretins would be a part of such business.
Also that if we were a government of thieves we would not need drugs to
obtain wealth, as others have done elsewhere in different times. But, surely
a government like that would have been ousted long ago because our revolutionary,
learned and conscientious people would neither support it nor tolerate
it. (APPLAUSE) I added that no country was in a better position than Cuba
to fight drugs within our waters and our borders.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I spoke to him about the boat we salvaged and seized
three years ago off the southeastern coast of Cuba. It was sinking because
it had been boarded by a US Coast Guard party that later abandoned it.
The crew had opened up the valves to scuttle the boat and prevent the seizure
of the cargo and the evidence but it drifted into Cuban waters and our
Coastal patrol salvaged it. Almost seven tons of highly pure cocaine was
found on board. We informed the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and requested
that they take part in the search. Everything was done quietly and all
the drugs and papers were handed over to them. They had said they would
need them as evidence in the coming trial.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I explained that we cooperated in drug interdiction
as much I we could, the same we do in the cases of alien smuggling but
that the United States, for strictly political reasons, had eluded establishing
any agreements for a systematic and serious cooperation project. I added
that given the way drug smugglers operated, by air or by sea, it was very
difficult to intercept a small plane by day or by night and force it to
land if it refused to do so.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I said that drugs were dropped at a distance of 5
to 20 miles off Cuban coasts. That some years ago, if they washed up on
the keys or the island people handed them over voluntarily; there were
no dollars here then. Now, much persuasion and organizational effort is
required to obtain the people’s cooperation. Sanctions against domestic
trafficking had to be tightened because a domestic market was emerging.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I also explained to him what had happened with two
purported Spanish businessmen. These people had established a joint venture
and operated a factory here. But, their real purpose --as would later be
discovered-- was to send drugs to Europe through Cuba by stuffing them
into the walls of containers where they imported raw materials from Colombia
and sent the manufactured products to Spain. I said to him that, in the
face of such deception and the risk of serious damage to the country, we
were compelled to establish the most severe sanctions for large-scale drug
trafficking through our country.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Allow me a digression now in this account of the
events.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Actually, these two <i>"businessmen"</i> could have
been arrested if only the Colombian authorities --in compliance with existing
agreements-- had informed us about the drugs that had been seized in Colombia
found hidden in the walls of several containers belonging to the alleged
businessmen. They simply made this information public in December.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">If they had only coordinated with us, those two could
have easily been arrested. But instead they made this public announcement,
adding that the containers were bound for Cuba. It was an incomplete, confusing
and odd report, which I analyzed also publicly on January 5, just a few
days later. I was most upset that they were talking about drugs bound for
Cuba and seized in Colombia as if they were talking about just any commodity
imported by the country on a regular basis. I protested that way of handling
things.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The result is that those guys are still at large
in Spain. They were arrested in January and held for a few days then set
free because there was no evidence against them, according to that country’s
authorities, to which we have offered all the necessary cooperation. In
Colombia, only the man in custody of the drugs was arrested.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">They was a public response to my January 5 statement
where those two individuals claimed their innocence and argued that it
was all a fabrication aimed at seizing their little factory. It was just
that, a cheap little factory with which they had deceived some of our people
and betrayed the good faith of a Cuban entity because they had proposed
an investment, a joint venture to supply the technology and market for
the ornamental objects produced.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">These gentlemen on whose deeds there is irrefutable
evidence should have been arrested and detained in Spain, in Europe or
wherever they try to hide. If there are people serving dozens of years
in prison for less serious crimes, why are these two gentlemen freely travelling
in Europe?</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Now, I shall continue with the story of my conversation
with the American lawmaker.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">After I told him about the attempt at large-scale
drug trafficking through Cuba by the two Spanish citizens, I also explained
to him that there had been attempts at smaller scale trafficking. That
recently a group of 18 people --British, Canadian and Jamaican citizens--
were arrested trying to introduce 50 kilograms of cocaine hidden in their
overcoats, that they would be brought to justice and face the sanctions
for small-scale trafficking, which have also been made more severe. They
were somewhat lucky, since the amendments made a few months later by the
National Assembly were not yet in force.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Finally, when he asked me if an anti-drug cooperation
agreement between the United States and Cuba would be of much help, I told
him that this island is more than 1200 kilometers long and has 5746 kilometers
of coasts. Also, that I believed serious talks should be held between both
countries on drug smuggling interdiction and that we wanted nothing in
return, not even permission for American farmers to sell food to Cuba.
That we worked on ethical principles and had done so for 40 years despite
the U.S. blockade and that we did not even ask for the lifting of the blockade
as a condition. I said that such an agreement would benefit the United
States fifty times more than it would Cuba but that we would also benefit
because the drugs that increasingly washed up on our coasts were harmful
to us.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">When he interrupted me to ask whether Cuba would
allow the U.S. authorities to act in our waters or airspace, I categorically
responded that it would not. I said that the United States would not accept
Cuban naval or aircraft to enter its territorial waters or airspace, that
such an agreement could only be reached on a reciprocal basis. I am convinced,
said I, that it is ridiculous, truly ridiculous that the US government
for fear of the Miami groups outcry has not signed an agreement with Cuba
on drug trafficking interdiction when we were ready to do it for nothing,
simply as an international moral duty.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I clearly expressed to him that three possible forms
of cooperation could be established: modest cooperation, larger and more
effective cooperation or a comprehensive cooperation. That for the two
first our own resources sufficed but for a highly effective comprehensive
cooperation we needed some technical and communication means that were
not within our reach, although we had all the skilled staff required.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In concluding I said more or less exactly the following:
"Please, ask the highest authorities in your country what level of cooperation
they want, whether the present level, a higher level or the highest level
possible. I simply say that we are ready for any of those degrees of cooperation.
Anyway, if they are not interested we will still continue to do what we
are doing on our own because it is our duty to defend ourselves from the
damage caused by drug trafficking; it is a national interest and an international
duty as well. That was the end of that part of my conversation with him.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The <i>Washington Post</i> articles we already mentioned
and the sensible statements made by some senior authorities, including
renowned US lawmakers, caused some alarm among the counterrevolutionary
mob in Miami and its Congressional allies whose electoral campaigns are
funded by the Cuban-American National Foundation --a confirmed terrorist
organization that in 1997 planned and funded attacks with powerful explosives
on hotels in Havana.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">If you consider the dates of these events --the <i>Washington
Post</i> articles on May 25; then, in the first half of June a series of
statements by officials, lawmakers, anti-drug authorities and others; and
a bill promoting to negotiate an agreement with Cuba-- and what immediately
followed, you can accurately outline and sketch the scheme quickly plotted
and readily unleashed by the counterrevolutionary mob, its allies and lobbies
working endlessly, round the clock, against Cuba, to thwart any anti-drug
cooperation. It is crystal clear, as you will see.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On June 19, that is, almost a month after the two
May 25 articles, a favorable climate was creating. Then, <i>El Nuevo Herald</i>,
a newspaper that often serves the interests of that mob published an article
by journalist Maria Travieso under the heading <b><i>"Strong Rejection
to Anti-Drug War with Cuba"</i></b>, which reads:</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"The State Department’s announcement that next
Monday officials from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the Coast Guard
service will visit Cuba to cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking
caused hot reactions in the Cuban sectors of southern Florida.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"`The sending of these officials did not surprise
me. It is consistent with the administration's policy of appeasement and
collaboration with Castro's regime,' said Republican congressman for Florida
Lincoln Diaz-Balart.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Diaz-Balart, who received a direct call from
the State Department informing him of the officials' trip to Cuba, was
clearly very annoyed."</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial">Look how the mechanism works and the fruits of the
government timid and hesitant actions against the virulence and permanent
blackmail by the anti-Cuban mob. They decide to send some officials to
discuss these issues and then call the heads of the mob to humbly inform
them that they are sending these people to Cuba. Of course, the outcry,
the uproar, the insults and even the threats against the administration
immediately began through all possible media and also the maneuvers to
jeopardize such action.</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"The federal official said that several weeks
ago, when the U.S. government leaked information to the press on Castro's
alleged support to the war against drugs, the beginning of what we will
see on Monday took place'.</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"He added that there is a major difference between
these meetings and the usual review of agreements by both countries on
migratory issues. ‘They have already admitted'</i> --this insolent says--
<i>`that
this is a matter of cooperation in an area where Castro has nothing to
do, because he is one of the biggest drug traffickers in the world,' Diaz-Balart
said."</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial">The article continues: <i>"The Cuban-American National
Foundation, through its chairman Alberto Hern&aacute;ndez..." </i>--who
happens to be the owner of one of the two .50-caliber semi-automatic rifles
they were planning to kill me with on Isla Margarita, with a telescopic
sight, infrared rays, a 1400-meter range and the capacity to pierce an
armored car at 400 meters or to shoot down a plane about to land or moving
along a runway, and so on; the owner of one of them, I repeat, is this
gentleman.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">A boat, also owned by them, was seized in Puerto
Rico. By mere chance, a Coast Guard cutter searching for drugs seized it
and the powerful weapons were found. Before they realized what was happening,
they were already in the hands of the Puerto Rican authorities. This happy
owner of the gun "very legally" registered in his name and organizer of
the attack continues to live completely free in the United States. He was
not included in the trial even when he was the Foundation leader. Now,
they have daddy’s fair child there but, as always, the other remains at
the top.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I continue with the article: <i>"The Cuban-American
National Foundation, through its chairman Alberto Hern&aacute;ndez, reacted
strongly to the announcement: `This is simply outrageous. We will take
our opposition wherever necessary. It is unacceptable for the Cuban community
in exile and on the island,' he said."</i> The only thing missing was a
threat to kill the president of the United States or to shoot him with
one of those guns bought there, that are so accurate and have such a long
range.</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Other colleagues of Diaz-Balart supported his
position. Florida Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen described
President Bill Clinton's government attitude as absurd. "This only goes
to prove the desire of the Clinton's administration to cooperate with Fidel
Castro's dictatorship. To say that his regime collaborates in the war on
drugs is as absurd, illogical and incorrect as can be,' she commented."</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial">On July 17, an EFE cable headed <b><i>"Republican
Members of Congress Propose Including Cuba in Drug Certification Process"</i></b>
read as follows:</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Two Republican leaders from the US House of Representatives
have proposed including Cuba in the State Department's annual evaluation
of countries cooperating in the fight against drug trafficking.</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"Congressmen Dan Burton (Indiana)"</i> --a well-known
name, it does ring a bell, an off-key bell that has rung loudly in association
with a genocidal law, in partnership with Helms; now the big shots come
into action, representatives and senators associated with the mob-- <i>"and
Benjamin Gilman (New York), co-sponsors of the bill, consider that Cuba
is one of the main countries involved in international drug trafficking.</i></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"The legislation coincides with reports that the
US government is readying to approve new measures to ease the economic
embargo on Cuba.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"The State Department does not include Cuba in
its evaluation of countries that cooperate with the United States in the
anti-drugs fight due to its interpretation that the law does not apply
to countries with which it does not engage in trade.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Two State Department officials visited Havana
last month to discuss possible cooperation projects including counter-drug
trafficking operations.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"The House of Representatives began its investigation
on Cuba and drug trafficking after Colombian police seized seven tons of
cocaine on December last that was supposedly destined for a company in
Havana."</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial">See how these gentlemen dare to mix Cuba up in this
vulgar affair. The United States and Europe have not even been capable
of arresting such dangerous subjects. Let them be sent to Cuba to be tried
by our courts in a public trial, with absolute and total transparency.
There is no need to fear because, in the end, the sanctions later approved
by the National Assembly were not yet in force. Let them be sent here and
let us argue the case before the courts but, of course, they must be caught
first.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Who is helping them so that they cannot be found?
Their main crime they committed here where they set up their factory, betrayed
the country's good faith and used our opening up to trade, to investments
and tourism to try to turn our national territory into a transit point
for drug trafficking. They put up a small factory here. It is unquestionably
obvious that they had a deliberate intent to traffic in drugs on a large
scale. They were already setting up other small financial businesses for
loans and other activities.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Now let’s see if they can hide in Europe and evade
Interpol, which cannot be all that easy. They are well known individuals
and must have quite a lot of money. Why have they not been caught? Or could
it be that they were sent to set up a provocation against Cuba? What could
the reason be? We are demanding that they be captured and sent to our country;
that would be fitting. We have a priority right to bring them to trial.
It was here that they put up their little factory; it was here that they
brought the containers of raw materials secretly stuffed with drugs; it
was here that they filled them with products from the factory and sent
them to Spain; it was here that they committed their main crimes: bringing
in the drugs, handling them, breaking the laws and deceiving the country.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Let them be sent here to be tried: that is our response
and our challenge that cannot be eluded; and may lawyers come from all
over the world, if they so wish, to defend them, to observe or to take
part in the trial and confirm the truth. You can see the way things are
twisted, all the tricks, the scheming, the slanders and lies.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I shall continue:</font>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"At the time, however, the US State Department
said that there were no links between the drug shipment and Cuban President
Fidel Castro’s government,"</i> concludes the EFE dispatch.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">To tell the truth, the FBI, the CIA, the Administration
and everybody there knows how things are here; they know it only too well.
Of course, they are never concerned about the slanders against Cuba, about
the many things that are said against Cuba; that over and over, infamous
attempts are made to link personalities from our country, leaders from
our country to this repugnant issue, with no respect for anyone.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">See how they used the most exemplary trial ever held
to turn it into a source of nasty schemes against Cuba; a trial that set
an example to the world of how any manifestation, any tendency towards
complicity with drug trafficking must be cut at the source.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">We also struggle tirelessly against something as
common throughout the world as corruption, to which no high official from
the Party or the government must ever give in.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">We cannot be Utopians and aspire to not having any
cases of people who commit such misdeeds. Rather, we must fight tenaciously
against them within the country's administrative apparatus and, of course,
they will never be tolerated in a senior political or government leader.
This trench must never be lost. (APPLAUSE)</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Here we have a case where the State Department, which
is aware of the truth about the matter and our protest at the time of the
seizure in Colombia, said according to this article <i>"that there were
no links between this drug shipment and Cuban President Fidel Castro’s
government"</i>. It should be acknowledged that this was a State Department’s
objective and honest statement.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Well then, I shall continue with the wire dispatches
because they really help demonstrate how the conspiracy is built up day
by day. Remember that we began in late May, and now we have reached July
7.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On July 7 itself, an AFP dispatch from Washington
stated:</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Republican Senator Dan Burton introduced a bill
before the US Congress on Wednesday to declare Cuba a major drug trafficking
state, in light of suspicions that the island's government is an accessory
to the smuggling of drugs into the United States."</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial">An EFE dispatch posted in Washington on July 13 --this
is another dispatch-- reads:</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Three US Cuban American lawmakers --two Republicans
and one Democrat-- accused the United States of covering up `Castro's tyranny,'
the trafficking in human beings and drugs, money laundering and a `series
of illicit dealings.'</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"They made these accusations because they believe
that the governments of Washington and Havana are encouraging the departure
of Cubans for the United States to economically benefit Castro.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln D&iacute;az-Balart,
both Republicans for Florida, and Robert Men&eacute;ndez, Democrat for
New Jersey, expressed their annoyance with President Bill Clinton's administration
for all the decisions it has adopted in favor of the Cuban government.'</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"The members of the US House of Representatives
spoke with the press after a meeting with representatives of the State
and Justice Departments and the Coast Guard Service on the latest incidents
involving Cuban rafters in Florida waters.'</font></i><font face="Arial">
They were meeting there with administration officials. Any time they wish,
they are received with full honors and given all sorts of explanations.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The dispatch continues: <i>"The three harshly criticized
the official authorization given to a group of members of the US Chamber
of Commerce to visit the island, as part of Washington's policy of promoting
people-to-people contact between the United States and Cuba.</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial">The government agreed to certain measures, a dream,
some advice received from the well-known Council on Foreign Relations in
New York to change its policy and do something different assuming it was
easier to destroy the Revolution by other means. That is the source, it
is not new; it was already set out in the Torricelli Act, lots of people-to-people
contacts as if the Cuban state and government did not exist. They even
subtly raised the matter of sending money, in fact, of every American buying
a Cuban but since there are so many Americans and just a little more than
10 million of us, the price of Cubans will rise; there is only one for
every 27 Americans.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">All this is well known. There has been talk about
that policy and other tactics: that the idea of suffocating the country
with the blockade should be abandoned; that, on the contrary, they should
influence, corrupt, alienate, destroy the Revolution from within. These
are two different lines with only one objective but the peaceful one will
always be preferable to the other although we know very well the aim pursued
by each of them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The mob harshly criticizes the current administration's
concept of the "promotion of people-to-people contacts". They do not want
anyone to visit this island. They are against migratory agreements, they
are against anti-drug agreements; they are totally against any different
tactic with regard to Cuba, any different initiative, no matter what the
intention or the interest of the US government might be. They simply advocate
the most extremist actions, the provocation of a conflict, even a war,
all the more so in the last few months, encouraged by the events in Yugoslavia.
They dream of seeing this country subjected to a similar operation.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The July 13 cable goes on to say: <i>"The lawmakers
suggested that to keep Castro's maneuvers in check Washington should threaten
Cuba with preventing the island’s access to oil and other pressures."</i>
Note the leonine or feline intentions behind the maneuvers we are unmasking
here.</font>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"Lincoln Diaz-Balart stated that `after all, what
exists between the United States and Cuba' --listen to this-- `is a convergence
of interests between leftist ideologists led by White House Samuel Berger
(a National Security advisor) and capitalist opportunists.'"</i> Listen
to him. He sounds like an outstanding student from the &Ntilde;ico L&oacute;pez
Communist Party Cadre School: <i>"convergence of interests between leftist
ideologists led by White House Samuel Berger and capitalist opportunists."</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial">The following day, July 14, AFP reported from Washington:</font>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"Anti-Castro Republican members of Congress warned
the White House this Wednesday that all anti-drug cooperation with Cuba
is in their view a violation of American law."</i> In fact, they are almost
threatening him with imprisonment.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In a letter to President Bill Clinton, Jesse Helms,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Benjamin Gilman,
chairman of the House International Relations Committee asked him to instruct
US officials to cease providing air traffic information to the Cuban authorities
for the purposes of anti-drug cooperation.</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Sharing such information would expose US officials
to criminal liability for the shooting down of civilian planes by the Cubans"</font></i><font face="Arial">,
the congressmen claimed.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">An intense publicity campaign was already underway.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On July 22 --note the date-- the <i>Diario de las
Am&eacute;ricas</i> published an article by journalist Santiago Arocha
under the headline <b><i>"Drug Trafficker Paid Expenses of Infiltrated
Cuban Spies,"</i></b> which reads as follows:</font>
<p><font face="Arial">"The group of people arrested in Miami by the FBI
last September and accused of spying for Cuba received money from a drug
trafficker sentenced by the US justice system, according to Federal Court
documents from the South Florida district obtained by <i>Diario de las
Am&eacute;ricas</i>."</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Look at how they mix up the drug-trafficking issue
with a group of Cuban Americans charged of spying for Cuba a case used
to create a tremendous scandal. I addressed the subject in Oporto on a
long CNN interview that everybody could watch.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Now, at this precise moment, they are trying to mix
the case up with the alleged financing of these citizens by a drug trafficker.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">They make things up, try to mix espionage with drugs
in order to create a scandal, to frighten and deceive the public and to
intimidate the US government.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">When they started the espionage scandal, Cuba's position
was expressed clearly and objectively. As part of the current campaign,
they came up with the idea of combining that episode with drug trafficking.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The article goes on:</font>
<p><font face="Arial">"While accepting funds from a person sentenced for
importing 150 kilos of cocaine, in their communications with Havana the
agents criticized the ‘United States social vices and huge distortions'".</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Actually, there is nothing strange about anyone there
speaking of social vices and huge distortions because those who act as
if they owned the United States have turned the "Little Havana" district
of Miami into Sodom and Gomorrah.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Finally --this is very important-- on July 23, three
days ago, the<b> </b><i>Miami Herald</i> published an article by well-known
journalist Juan O. Tamayo under the following headline: <b><i>"US plans
full review of Cuban connections to illegal drug trade"</i></b>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The article reads:</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"The Clinton administration has ordered a top-to-bottom
review of Cuba's alleged links to drug smugglers, in response to harsh
attacks on its efforts to expand anti-narcotics cooperation with Havana.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">The key part of the inquiry is `an all-sources
intelligence review,' a re-examination of all data on Cuba held by half-dozen
agencies, from the DEA to the CIA, top administration officials said.</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"The Justice Department was asked separately to
review evidence gathered by a Miami federal grand jury in 1993 that nearly
indicted President Fidel Castro's brother on cocaine smuggling charges,
officials added."</i> Nearly indicted! Alluding to or making any accusations
in this regard against Raul, a man so well known for his integrity throughout
his entire political and revolutionary life, is simply disgusting.</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"State Department lawyers were also asked to reconsider
whether the transit of drugs through Cuban waters and airspace is sufficient
to land Cuba on the list of countries that are major transit points for
the US market, the so-called `majors list'.</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"The reviews to be completed by October"</i> --listen
to that, the reviews to be completed by October-- <i>"have frozen recent
administration efforts to expand drug interdiction contacts with President
Fidel Castro’s government, including an unprecedented meeting held this
month between US and Cuban officials</i>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In other words, these guys, with all their screaming
and shouting, their impudence start destabilizing the government, which
should know very well what it is doing and should be very well informed,
extremely well informed of the truth about Cuba. It could ask some of its
allies what they know for a fact about Cuba in terms of drugs.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Oh, but these people immediately put up their show
and blackmail to put pressure on the man. They want him to hesitate and
take any steps whether it is an investigation, a review or a reshuffling
of papers. The result is that something really important for the American
people must wait until at least October.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Sure, I understand. We understand all this very well
because elections are involved, the ongoing politicking, concerns over
the votes of this and that group, and whether they can decide a presidential
election. It happens that a state like Florida has so many votes in the
presidential election, so many points and it is essential to win in big
states; calculations and more calculations. And this calculating begins
the day politicians begin dreaming or thinking of running for president.
Countless politicking interests, you could say. I cannot say political
interests in this case because, in our view, politics is something more
decent, more courageous and transparent. But it is not so for them. They
are slaves of their own demagogy, their own methods.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In response to the shouting they say, "Calm down,
we are your fairest and dearest friends", and they stop anything they are
doing. They had decided to send some officials simply to explore and make
the first contacts. They know what Cuba's cooperation means. They know
Cuba and the Cuban people. They know them well: the only country in the
world that could radically stop the one known case --in 40 years of Revolution--
when senior officials were involved in drug trafficking. They know it very
well. Cuba’s performance in this field is very useful to the United States,
to the American people, the children, adolescents and young people who
are victims of drug trafficking.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">But, no! Other things are far more important for
politicians: votes here or there, a nomination to the Senate or Congress,
and so on. That is the truth. In other words, this article shows how these
factors have put a brake on efforts aimed at cooperation.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I had predicted all of this to the congressman who
came here. "It is silly not to reach a serious agreement for fear of the
shouting in Miami!" I told him this in early June and look what happened
in July.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Here is something really interesting.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On Friday, July 23, our Interests Section in Washington
received an envelope from Senator Helms' office with a copy of a letter
sent by him and Congressman Benjamin A. Gilman to President Bill Clinton
on July 13, 1999, which reads:</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Dear Mr. President:</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"We write regarding the emerging notion that it
might be possible for the United States to cooperate with the Castro regime
in Cuba on counter-narcotics matters.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Mr. President, we defer to no one in our insistence
that the United States exhaust <u>all efforts</u> to stem the tide of illegal
drugs. In the case of Cuba, however, we expect that such cooperation will
do little more than enable the Castro regime to divert attention from the
fact that, since the early 1980s, senior officials of the Castro regime
have been repeatedly accused, in US federal courts, of conspiring to smuggle
cocaine into the United States.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"The purpose of this letter, however, is more
specific. We have been informed by State Department and Coast Guard officials
that they have routinely provided tracking data to Cuban authorities regarding
suspicious aircraft heading toward Cuban territory. We understand, in fact,
that these agencies have proposed the establishment of direct telephone
communications with the Castro regime in order to pass this data to their
Cuban counterparts more quickly.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"It appears to us, however, that such information-sharing
raises serious concerns under the analysis of applicable US criminal laws
set forth in the Memorandum of June 17, 1994, from Assistant Attorney General
Walter Dillinger to Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick."</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial">They continue with three long pages of demagogic
arguments, full of sophisms and lies, to conclude in a convoluted and threatening
style:</font>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>"We will appreciate"</i> --they tell the President--
<i>"your
review of any information sharing activities with the Castro regime and
an explanation of why these activities are not prohibited under the reasoning
of the Dillinger Memorandum. It is our expectation that you will
<u>instruct
US officials to cease and desist</u> from sharing such information with
the Cuban regime until you have ensured that they are not exposing themselves
to criminal liability by so doing."</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial">That same day, July 23, <i>El Nuevo Herald</i> published
a news item dealing with the review or re-examination of all intelligence
sources. That newspaper published some news that it undoubtedly found out
about through its relations with the counter-revolutionary Cuban mob, closely
linked to the extreme right in the US Congress. It is no coincidence that
on that same day, our Interests Section received an envelope with a copy
of the letter that was replied only after July 20, although it had been
signed and sent to Clinton on July 13.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">They had obtained something: they had paralyzed the
administration, which was beginning to take steps towards more efficient
drug-trafficking control. Any decision in this matter was postponed several
months. So, the usual thing happened, as I have already explained. Any
sensible and constructive initiative by the US administration sets off
the shouting, hysteria and blackmail of a mob that acts as if it owned
the United States. That, of course, leads to conciliatory gestures that
weaken or postpone the decision over a policy that is most correct and
advisable for the interests of the United States itself.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I have a few more things here. For instance, on June
25, one month after the <i>Washington Post</i> articles were published,
Representative [Charles] Rangel introduced a bill that was referred to
the International Relations Committee. This bill proposed <i>"to authorize
the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to enter into
negotiations with representatives of the Government of Cuba to provide
for increased cooperation between Cuba and the United States on Drug interdiction
efforts."</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial">Section 1 of the bill states, among other points:</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Illegal drug abuse is a national security issue
affecting every region, economic group, race and religion in the United
States.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Drug abuse-related crime is costing the United
States economy at least $5,000,000,000 per year.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"At least 30 percent of the illegal drugs that
enter the United States are transported through the Caribbean region.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"The flow of illegal drugs through the Caribbean
region cannot be stopped without cooperation from the Government of Cuba.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Numerous United States law enforcement authorities
have expressed the need for increased cooperation with Cuban authorities
on this matter."</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial">Hardly seven days had passed after submission of
this bill when the notorious Mr. Burton, Representative for Indiana, submitted
on his behalf and that of Mr. Gilman another bill proposing <i>"to provide
for the determination that Cuba is a major drug-transit country for purposes
of section 490(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.</i></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America in Congress assembled."</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial">Section 1 of this bill states that <i>"this Act may
be cited as the `Cuban Drug-Trafficking Act of 1999'".</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial">In an extremely wily, cynical and even confusing
way, so much so that it seems a crafty intrigue rather than a piece of
legislation, the bill sets forth an <i>"Exception": "Subsection (a) shall
not be effective if the President determines, based upon conclusive evidence,
that no substantial portion of the approximately 7.2 metric tons of cocaine
seized in December 3, 1998, in Cartagena, Colombia, was destined for transit
to the United States either directly or indirectly through Cuba."</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial">That same day, July 1, an ultra-conservative Representative
named Smith from New Jersey --home of Torricelli, Bob Men&eacute;ndez and
a real Cosa Nostra headquarters-- simultaneously presented on his own behalf
and that of Ms. McKinney an additional bill. This would be an amendment
to the Appropriation bill authorizing the State Department funds for fiscal
year 2000. He proposed adding the following amendment to the bill:</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Section 202. Report on Cuban Drug-Trafficking.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"Not later than 90 days after the date of the
enactment of this Act and every 180 days thereafter, the Secretary of State
shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees an unclassified
report (with a classified annex) on the extent of international drug trafficking
from, through, or over Cuba. Each report shall include the following:</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"(1) Information concerning the extent to which
the Cuban Government or any official, employee, or entity of the Government
of Cuba has engaged in, facilitated, or condoned such trafficking.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"(2) The extent to which the appropriate agencies
of the United States Government have investigated and prosecuted such activities
of the Cuban Government or any official, employee, or entity of the Government
of Cuba.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"(3) A determination of whether the Government
of Cuba should be included in the list of nations considered to be major
drug trafficking countries."</font></i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial">In summary: on June 25, New York Representative [Charles]
Rangel tabled a bill favoring cooperation with Cuba on drug control on
July 1, three Representatives, Burton and Gilman and Smith --all closely
linked to the Cuban-American National Foundation, which provides major
contributions to their election campaigns, especially to the first two--
tabled two bills, one of them as an amendment to a pressing appropriations
bill. It was based on complete lies and shameful procedures and arguments
and it posed gross legal obstacles to all forms of cooperation in drug
control.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">When the Cuban American mob's allies in Congress,
experts in legal chicanery, want something to move quickly they do not
introduce an independent bill, which would require long-drawn-out procedures
and a great deal of time. Instead, they introduce their bills in the form
of amendments to major bills that must be passed quickly. Often these bills
are so very long and full of details that the members of Congress pass
them without even reading them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Now then, we will see what the government does. Anyone
can see that that country is a chaos, full of contradictions. First, a
constructive bill is introduced and then the mob and its allies immediately
introduce two others and use the amendment mechanism as well. Rangel honorably
and honestly introduces his as an independent bill; the others resort to
the old discredited trick of amendments.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The review of all the crazy things they do and the
analysis of the letter sent by Mr. Helms and Mr. Gilman to the president
of the United States, together with the other things I have described draw
a clear picture of the immorality, dishonesty and demagoguery contained
in the way laws and amendments against our country find their way in the
United States.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Because of its geographical location, Cuba is undoubtedly
one of the most strategic points in the hemisphere for the fight against
drug trafficking. The Old Bahaman Channel, given its proximity to the United
States, has become a favorite area for drug smugglers to get their shipments
to US coasts. Airplanes drop their cargoes on the water along this route
to be picked up by speedboats with three powerful motors that can go up
to 100 kilometers an hour. Similar operations are carried out between medium-sized
boats and speedboats. Most of the times these speedboats elude capture,
just like the ones used to smuggle aliens. As a result, there has been
in recent years a boom in international drug trafficking activities in
the waters of this area.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In the first half of 1999, the drug loads that washed
up on Cuba's northern coast along the length of the Channel totaled 4,539
kilograms; these are the drugs that were left adrift and washed up on our
coasts. This figure represents a 60% increase compared to the same time
period last year, and it already exceeds in half the time, the 4,484 kilograms
seized this way throughout last year. It is plain to see how this activity
has increased, and how drug smugglers have chosen this area as one of their
favorites in the Caribbean.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">From Cayo Confites, off the north coast of Cuba,
you can see the lighthouse on one of the Bahamian islands. Truly effective
control of this lengthy route can only be accomplished in close cooperation
with Cuba.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I have here a 41-page report, with relatively small
print and single spacing, issued by the National Anti-Drug Division and
the Border Guard Troop Division, which recounts the principal international
drug trafficking cases recorded throughout the '90s. These 41 pages document
every operation, month by month, year by year and many of them have taken
place north of Cuba.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">No other country has ever done what we have done,
nor with greater selflessness. That is a source of pleasure for us. This
seems like a good moment --because we have invited members of the diplomatic
corps to be here with us, including friends of the United States coming
from Europe and other places-- to give them an idea of the sanity left
to many political leaders in that country, their ethic, common sense, even
the patriotism that is left to them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Here is the evidence. These things are irrefutable
and we are willing to discuss them with anyone, anywhere. There is neither
other country with a greater sense of morality nor one more capable of
defending its truths. (APPLAUSE) There is no other country more transparent
in its actions confronting tricks, misdeeds, conspiracies, stupidity and
arrogance.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Nothing about the aforementioned proposals against
Cuba frightens us in the least. We would not even be frightened by the
news that a meteor was headed straight for the Earth. (APPLAUSE) Our people
learned a long time ago not to fear anyone or anything.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I want to conclude with the following statement:</font>
<p><font face="Arial">By sabotaging an agreement between Cuba and the United
States to fight the international drug trafficking --similar to the one
established against the trafficking of immigrants-- Senator Helms, Representatives
Burton, Gilman, and Smith and 10 or 12 other lawmakers associated with
the Cuban-American National Foundation objectively become drug trafficking's
greatest allies.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">That is the truth. Whose interest does it hurt? Who
does it harm? They are largely accountable for the hundreds of tons of
various drugs that end up in the hands of millions of adolescents and young
people in the United States, or people who suffer the terrible scourge
of drugs. A major part of such drugs could be intercepted through serious,
responsible and efficient cooperation between Cuba and the United States.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">If I let myself get carried away, like they do, by
frustration and stupidity I might say that they receive money from drug
traffickers. Nevertheless, I calmly believe that it is demagoguery, combined
with vulgar political interests and hatred for a people they have not been
able to force into submission and whom they hope to destroy with their
economic warfare and genocidal laws, that have led them to stoop to such
despicable acts. (APPLAUSE)</font>
<p><font face="Arial">McCaffrey is a professional military man who can
be assumed to know something about tactics and strategy. It is not at all
strange for him to react with a natural understanding that you cannot win
a battle with such a vulnerable flank and your hands tied when it comes
to taking action in that direction.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">It is also understandable, as many intelligent people
in the United States are beginning to discern, that with the destruction
of the Cuban revolution and the moral values it has brought to the country
–which would be impossible, in any event-- this island would become the
most dangerous center of corruption, gambling, drug trafficking and crime
in the world, something much worse than a political, economic and social
system so despised by the extreme right in the United States.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">This is a system that amidst a cruel and merciless
political and economic war waged by the mightiest power that has ever existed
has managed to provide the people with full independence, health care,
education, culture, dignity and worldwide admiration and solidarity in
its heroic struggle. (APPLAUSE) This has been demonstrated by the almost
unanimous United Nations vote against the blockade on Cuba.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">For the time being, the Miami mob and its most reactionary
allies in Congress, with the review the administration has granted them
--the results of which are known beforehand, because the institutions assigned
with this unnecessary task will have to tell the truth out of an elementary
sense of self-respect-- have seen to it that something as necessary, indispensable
and beneficial to the US society as cooperation in international drug-trafficking
control will be delayed several months.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">It is certain that fanciful stories and unscrupulous
fabrications will not deceive these professionally prestigious institutions.
Throughout these 40 years there is not even a nail they can hang on to.
They will have to draw their own conclusions. I do not believe the administration
is going to put pressure on them because the administration is interested
in doing something constructive and positive in this field that is useful
for the American people.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">If serious cooperation were established, we could
even quantify the amount of drugs intercepted. It is the only possibility.
This island is 1,200 kilometers long; it is located between the Yucatan
Channel and the narrow sea separating Cuba from Haiti.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ours is the only country from which you can actually
control the international waters, and our own, south of the extensive Bahamian
islands, geographically the most convenient area for drug trafficking given
its proximity to the United States' coasts.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">But we do not only cooperate against drug smuggling
to the United States; we cooperate in the international community's fight
against drug trafficking in general, in conjunction with all of the countries
with which we have signed drug-drug-control agreements.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Who stand to benefit from this? Who stand to win
and who stand to lose, really? We are hurt --I already said it-- when drugs
are washed ashore, but we are taking measures and working with fishermen
and the population, urging them to cooperate. It is a hard job but our
country is organized and disciplined, and the masses always react positively.
It is these mass that we are now calling upon to confront another delicate
issue: a mob conspiracy to destroy the migratory agreements.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">All this has an impact. We know very well what they
are looking for, what they are aiming at. They are aiming at a Cuba-United
States conflict. Quite simply, this is their hope, their dream, as the
only way to destroy a Revolution nobody will ever be able to destroy.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Do you recall what Maceo said about those who attempt
to take over Cuba? What were they going to reap? (Shouts of "The dust of
its soil soaked in blood, if they do not perish in battle".)</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Unpatriotic persons do not care about anything. They
and those who have always supported them dream and underestimate Cuba,
as has happened so many times before. They have been underestimating our
country for 40 years now. They underestimated it when they thought they
could destroy our morale with covert wars. They underestimated it when
they thought that as soon as they landed at the Bay of Pigs, the people
would revolt but there they did not put up for long, for the people themselves
crushed them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">They underestimated our people when they thought
that after the socialist camp collapsed and the USSR disintegrated, the
Revolution would collapse as well. But here it is and with it the resolute
and courageous people gathered on this July 26 to commemorate the 46th
anniversary of the Moncada. (APPLAUSE)</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Perhaps such a sensible and simple step as the one
that the counter-revolutionary Cuban-American mob and its allies in the
US Congress are trying to sabotage will yield more than a substantial part
of the $17 billion the United States spends every year in the war on drugs.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Let us hope that the 50% of US voters who do not
abstain from voting can actually know about this and take it into account.
Some day the US people will be fully aware of these facts.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Cuba will unshakably continue marching forward along
the road paved that unforgettable July 26, 1953. (APPLAUSE)</font>
