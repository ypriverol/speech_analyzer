of the Revolution".</B></CENTER>

<P>People of Santiago,
<BR>Fellow countrymen throughout Cuba,
<P>&nbsp;My recollections take me back to that night on January 1st, 1959.
Again I am living all the excitement and every detail as if it was all
happening at this very moment.&nbsp; It does not seem real that destiny
has provided us with the strange privilege of addressing the people of
Santiago de Cuba again from the same place forty years later.
<P>&nbsp;That day before dawn when we had news that the tyrant and the
main bosses of his shameful regime had escaped from the irrepressible advance
of our forces, for a few seconds I felt surprisingly hollow.&nbsp; How
could that incredible victory have been possible? A little over 24 months
had passed from the time when we could again gather seven rifles, on 18
December 1956, after the extremely hard setback that practically annihilated
our group.
<P>&nbsp;We had resumed the struggle against a combined military force
of 80,000 men under arms with thousands of academy graduate commanding
officers, a high morale, attractive privileges, the unquestioned myth of
invincibility, an infallible advisory and steady supplies from the United
States. However, the ideal of justice embraced by a brave people made possible
the military and political miracle and subsequent baseless and ridiculous
attempts to save what was left of that exploiting and oppressive system
were swept away by the Rebel Army, the workers and the rest of the people
in 24 hours.
<P>&nbsp;Our passing sadness at the victory was actually a nostalgia for
the experience we had lived through, the fresh memory of the comrades who
fell throughout the struggle, the full awareness that those extraordinarily
difficult and adverse years forced us to be better than we had been before
and to turn those years into the most fruitful and creative of our lives.&nbsp;
We were to abandon our mountains, our fields, our habits of absolute and
necessary austerity, our stressful life always on the alert against an
enemy that could show up at any time, by land or air, during the 761 days
the war lasted; the tough but healthy, pure life of shared sacrifices and
dangers which brings men together as brothers and makes their best qualities
flourish together with the infinite capacity for devotion, selflessness
and altruism that every human being carries within himself.
<P>&nbsp;The wide gap between the enemy and ourselves in terms of means
and forces obligated us to do the impossible.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that
it was with rifles and anti-tank mines that we won the war, fighting in
every important action the artillery, the armored vehicles and especially
the enemy aviation which immediately showed to support them.
<P>&nbsp;The rifles and semiautomatic and automatic light-infantry weapons
we had were those that we could take from the enemy in combat. The explosives
used in our rudimentary workshops to produce the mines against the armored
vehicles and the accompanying infantry we obtained from the numerous bombs
they dropped on us, some of which did not explode.&nbsp; The unbeatable
tactic of attacking the enemy while in movement was a key factor.&nbsp;
Our commanding officers grew skillful in the art of provoking the enemy
to move out of their well fortified and, generally, unassailable positions.
<P>&nbsp;The operational enemy units or their garrisons were besieged and
their coming reinforcements destroyed; then, they were forced to surrender
out of hunger and thirst. They were constantly fired upon by our marksmen
who, day by day, tightened the circle avoiding live-costly head on attacks
since we lacked the suitable means and weapons for that.&nbsp; What we
learned in the mountains and heavy forests we ended up applying right on
the plains next to paved roads, under the shadow of citrus plantations,
fruit groves and even sugar-cane plantations useful to camouflage those
troops usually inexperienced, given the accelerated growth of our ranks
as more weapons were seized, although they were always commanded by more
experienced fighters to strike on the reinforcements by surprise.&nbsp;
Later, the same method was applied in the cities to isolate the different
military positions.
<P>&nbsp;That was how the city of Palma Soriano was occupied in only three
days and the plan devised to attack and overcome the 5000 troops force
in the Santiago de Cuba garrison town with only 1200 rebel combatants.&nbsp;
A hundred weapons from those seized in Palma had already been introduced
through the Santiago bay to start the uprising on the fifth day after unleashing
the operations that would successively encircle the four battalions defending
the periphery.&nbsp; I am leaving out more precise details about the plan.
I will rather point out that there was one rebel combatant for every four
enemy soldiers.&nbsp; We had never had a more favorable balance of forces!
<P>&nbsp;At Guisa, a few kilometers from Bayamo, the combat engagements
began with 180 men who had to fight the reinforcements sent through a paved
road and other routes from that city where the headquarters of the army
operational forces and thousands of its best troops with the support of
heavy tanks were deployed. Guisa fell in our hands on November 30, 1958,
after eleven days of intense combat when our forces grew with the weapons
seized and some additional reinforcements.
<P>&nbsp;This battle was a further demonstration of the extraordinary fighting
morale of our troops and their expeditiousness.&nbsp; Five months before,
on June of that same year, the enemy had launched its last apparently unbeatable
offensive against the General Command at La Plata, in the Sierra Maestra
mountains.&nbsp; However, we were no longer the inexperienced fighters
who had landed on December 2, 1956 although, again, there were not many
of us.&nbsp; The defense was undertaken with about 170 men but four weeks
later we came to around 300 fighters with the still very small forces headed
by Che [Guevara], Camilo [Cienfuegos], Ramiro [Valdes] and [Juan] Almeida
who had previously been instructed to move toward the positions occupied
by Column 1, the strategic objective of our enemy’s offensive, that is,
all our columns except the forces of the Second Eastern Front commanded
by Raul [Castro] which were too far away in the northeast mountains to
support our front.&nbsp; Hundreds of young volunteers without weapons were
training in the draftees’ school at Minas del Frio.
<P>&nbsp;After 74 days of intense combat, the enemy battalions sustained
close to one thousand casualties&nbsp; --dead, injured and prisoners combined--&nbsp;
440 of them remained our prisoners&nbsp; and were returned a few days later
through the International Red Cross. I am writing based on my own recollections.
Perhaps, historians will be able to further check this information with
our documents that have been preserved and with those found later in the
enemy's archives.&nbsp; I can assure you that over 500 weapons were seized
and given to the draftees from the school as they were taken from the enemy
when the fighting was over, without losing any time. Thus, with only 900
armed men marching in different directions the rebel columns invaded the
territory controlled by the enemy up to the center of the island, except
for the extensive eastern area firmly held by the Frank Pais Second Eastern
Front, and opened new war fronts that quickly developed.&nbsp; I was to
stay back in the headquarters with a few men.&nbsp; It was against this
background that Che and Camilo, with approximately 140 and 100 men respectively&nbsp;
--as far as I remember and without consulting any documents--&nbsp; carried
out one of the greatest deeds among the many I have known through the history
books. They left after a hurricane had hit the area and marched over 400
kilometers from the Sierra Maestra to the Escambray mountains.&nbsp; They
had to cross lowlands and marshy terrain infested with mosquitoes and enemy
soldiers under constant air surveillance, with no guides and no food, without
the logistic support of our underground movement weakly organized in the
area of their long route. They had to break from sieges, ambushes, successive
lines of containment and bombardments but they reached their goal.&nbsp;
Such was our confidence in the combatants who defeated the enemy offensive;
and, most important of all, such was the infinite confidence they had in
themselves and their legendary leaders.&nbsp; They were men of iron! To
the young people I recommend reading and re-reading the beautiful accounts
contained in the Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War written by Che.
<P>&nbsp;Since I have almost unwillingly been making these observations
about our struggle in the mountains, I shall now complete the story of
the events that led me once more to this beloved city on that January 1st,
whose 40th anniversary we are commemorating today.&nbsp; It was on 11 November
that I left La Plata with 30 armed men and 1,000 unarmed recruits.
<P>&nbsp;Those courageous and selfless youths were better trained in enduring
hunger, bombardment and a shortage of everything than they were in handling
weapons since there was never a single bullet available for live-shooting
training.&nbsp; They arrived in the school from all over the country in
enthusiastic waves but in those days only one out of ten could withstand
the conditions.&nbsp; Still, they filled our ranks and were more audacious
than our old fighters; taking inspiration from the traditions and stories
they heard they wanted to do in one day what others had done in years.
<P>&nbsp;Gathering small rebel units along the way, in addition to the
weapons from two enemy platoons which joined our ranks following their
Commander [Jose] Quevedo, our honorable and brave adversary in the Jig&uuml;e
battle, on the understanding that they would not fight against their former
comrades-in-arms, our long column brought together a vanguard force of
180 men with war weapons.&nbsp; In Guisa, Baire, Jiguani, Maffo and Palma
Soriano, settings of numerous actions, the recruits could realized their
fighting dreams as we advanced supported by other forces. Covering some
casualties from death, injuries or diseases of already equipped combatants
and with the weapons seized, my estimate is that once Palma was conquered
all the recruits who had left La Plata with me six weeks before were armed
and made up a formidable troop. Just in Palma, 350 weapons had been seized.
<P>&nbsp;I should point out, however, that not all the weapons that helped
turn the youths from our school at Minas del Frio into front-line fighters
were exclusively war trophies.&nbsp; In mid December, we received what
I considered the most precious aid in weapons from abroad: 150 semiautomatic
rifles and an automatic FAL [light assault rifle] for myself sent on behalf
of the Venezuelan people by Rear Admiral Larrazabal and the revolutionary
junta that took power in that country months before the Cuban triumph.&nbsp;
As may be assumed, those weapons were soon in action at the battles of
Jiguani, Maffo and Palma Soriano.
<P>&nbsp;That is why when we took over Palma and Maffo we had plenty of
weapons to provide the unarmed combatants and still send 100 for the uprising
in Santiago and a substantial number to Belarmino Castilla with instructions
to cut off the retreat of the battalion in Mayari.
<P>&nbsp;Since I have mentioned the Venezuelan aid, I should say that in
our revolutionary struggle we did not receive weapon supplies and munitions
from abroad except in very few cases of which by far the most numerous,
almost as much as all the rest that I remember or have heard mentioned,
was that of Venezuela.&nbsp; More than 90 percent of the weapons and munitions
we used to wage and win the war were seized from the enemy in combat.&nbsp;
They were only a few thousands but it was an unbreakable principle that
absolutely all of them were at all times in the front-line.
<P>&nbsp;These events have all been commemorated throughout the past year.
I have recalled just a few of them.
<P>&nbsp; Eternal honor and glory, infinite respect and affection to those
fell then to make possible the definitive independence of the homeland;
to all those who wrote that epic in the mountains, the countryside and
the cities, both guerrillas or underground fighters; to those who, after
the triumph, died in other glorious missions or loyally gave up their youth
and their energy to the cause of justice, sovereignty and the redemption
of their people; to those who have already died and those who are still
alive. On that January 1st we could speak of the triumph achieved five
years, five months and five days after 26 July 1953; on this anniversary,
taking the same date as reference, we can speak of a heroic and admirable
struggle of 45 years, five months and five days.&nbsp; (Applause.)
<P>&nbsp;Even today, for the younger generations, the Revolution is hardly
beginning.&nbsp; A day like this would be meaningless if we did not speak
for their benefit.
<P>&nbsp;Who are those present here?&nbsp; The vast majority are not the
same men, women and youth from that day.&nbsp; The people I am addressing
is not the same people from that January 1st.&nbsp; They are not the same
men and women.&nbsp; They are other, different people and still the same
eternal people.&nbsp; (Applause) Neither is the person talking from here
like this the same man from that day.&nbsp; It is someone much less younger
who bears the same name, dresses the same way,&nbsp; thinks the same and
dreams the same.&nbsp; (Applause.)
<P>&nbsp;Of the 11,142,700 people who make up the current population of
the country 7,190,400 had not been born yet; 1,359,698 were under 10 years
old.&nbsp; The vast majority of those who were 50 years old and who would
now be at least 90&nbsp; have died, although there are growing numbers
of people reaching that age.
<P>&nbsp;Some 30 percent of those fellow countrymen did not know how to
read or write.&nbsp; I think that maybe another 60 percent did not have
a sixth grade of schooling.&nbsp; There were only a few dozen technical
schools and senior high schools&nbsp; --not all within reach of the people--&nbsp;
a few teachers’ colleges, three public universities and one private.&nbsp;
There were 22,000 grammar and junior high school teachers.&nbsp; Perhaps
5 percent of adults, that is, about 250,000 people, had more than a sixth
grade of schooling.
<P>&nbsp;I remember some data.
<P>&nbsp;Today, the number of grammar and high school teachers with a much
higher level of education is over 250,000; doctors, 64,000; university
graduates, 600,000.&nbsp; There are no illiterates.&nbsp; It is very difficult
to find anyone with less than a sixth grade.&nbsp; Education is compulsory
up to ninth grade and after that they can continue, without exception and
free of charge, toward higher middle education.&nbsp; It is not worth the
trouble to look up for absolutely precise and exact data. There are facts
that nobody dares deny.&nbsp; Today, we can proudly state that we are the
country with the world's highest number per capita of educators, doctors
and physical education and sport teachers and with the lowest rate of infant
and maternal mortality in the Third World.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not intend, however, to talk about these and many
other social advances.&nbsp; There are much more important things than
these. The fact of the matter is that the people of today does not compare
with the people of yesterday.
<P>&nbsp;However, the illiterate and semiliterate people of yesterday with
barely a&nbsp; minimum of political culture were capable of making the
Revolution, defending the homeland, then achieving an extraordinary political
consciousness and starting a revolutionary process that has no parallel
in this hemisphere or the world. These words are not inspired in a ridiculous
chauvinism or the absurd pretense that we are better than other peoples
but rather on the fact that the Revolution born on that January 1st has
been subjected, by chance or fate, to the toughest test that any revolutionary
process in the world has been subjected to.
<P>&nbsp;Our heroic people of yesterday and today, our eternal people with
the participation of three generations now, has resisted 40 years of aggression
and blockade, of economic, political and ideological warfare by the richest
and mightiest imperialist power that history has known. The most extraordinary
page of patriotic and revolutionary steadfastness and glory this people
has written in the years of the special period when we were left absolutely
alone in the Western hemisphere 90 miles away from the United States and
we decided to carry on forward.
<P>&nbsp;Our people is not better than other peoples.&nbsp; Its enormous
historic valor derives from the peculiar fact that it has been subjected
to that test and it has resisted. It is not just a great people but a people
that has uplifted its spirit with the noble ideas and the justice of the
causes it defends. There are no other causes like these and there never
have been.&nbsp; Today,&nbsp; it would not make sense to selfishly defend
a national cause. In today's world an exclusively national cause cannot
in itself be a great cause.&nbsp; As a result of its own development and
historical evolution our world&nbsp; is rapidly going global, uncontrollably
and irreversibly so. Regardless of national and cultural identities and
the legitimate interests of the people in each country, no cause is more
important than a global cause, that is, the cause of Humanity itself.
<P>&nbsp;It is not our fault, nor can we take credit, if the struggle that
began on January 1st must inevitably become for the people of today and
tomorrow other people’s struggle for the benefit of all mankind.&nbsp;
No people on their own however great and rich they might be, much less
a middle size or small country, can solve their problems by themselves
and on their own. This reality can only be denied for lack of&nbsp; a forward-looking
approach, out of political shortsightedness or blindness or a total absence
of concern and sensibility for the human destiny.
<P>&nbsp;Solutions for mankind will not come from the goodwill of those
who now take possession of the world to exploit it, even though they cannot
dream or conceive of anything but the perennial nature of what is heaven
for them and hell for the rest of humanity, a real hell without any possible
remedy.
<P>&nbsp;The economic order prevailing in the world today will inevitably
fall.&nbsp; Even a schoolboy can understand that if he knows enough of
adding, subtracting, dividing and multiplying to pass a simple test in
arithmetic.
<P>&nbsp;Many resort to the childish argument of calling skeptics those
who talk about such issues.&nbsp; There are even those who dream of establishing
colonies on the Moon or on planet Mars.&nbsp; I do not criticize them for
dreaming; if they make it, that could perhaps be a place for some people
to take refuge in case the brutal and growing aggression to this planet
is not stopped.
<P>&nbsp;The current system is not sustainable because it is upheld by
blind, chaotic and ruinous laws that destroy society and nature.
<P>&nbsp;The very theoreticians of neo-liberal globalization, the best
academics and articulate advocates of the system are uncertain, hesitant
and confused.&nbsp; There are a thousand questions that cannot be answered.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Saying that the freedom of man and the absolute freedom of the market are
inseparable concepts is deceitful as if the laws of the market which have
given rise to the most selfish, unequal and merciless social systems man
has known were compatible with the freedom of the human being turned by
the system into simple merchandise.
<P>&nbsp;It would be much more accurate to say that without equality and
fraternity, the sacred slogans of the bourgeois revolution, there can never
be liberty and that equality and fraternity are absolutely incompatible
with the laws of the market.
<P>&nbsp;The tens of millions of children in the world forced to work,
to exercise prostitution, to give up body organs or sell drugs to survive;
the hundreds of millions of jobless people, the extreme poverty, the drug
trafficking, the smuggling of immigrants and human organs, like colonialism
yesterday and its current dramatic aftermath of underdevelopment, every
social calamity in the world today originated in systems based on those
laws.&nbsp; It should not be forgotten that the fight for markets led to
the dreadful carnage of two world wars in this century.
<P>&nbsp;It cannot be ignored that market principles are an inseparable
part of the historical development of mankind but any rational man has
every right to reject the supposed perpetuity of said social principles
as the basis for the subsequent development of the human species.
<P>&nbsp;The market's most fanatical advocates and followers have ended
up making it a new religion. Thus arises the theology of the market. Its
scholars are theologians rather&nbsp; than scientists.&nbsp; For them,
it is a matter of faith.&nbsp; Out of respect for the genuine religions
honestly practiced by billions of people in the world, and for the genuine
theologians, we might simply add that the theology of the market is sectarian,
fundamentalist and anti-ecumenical.
<P>&nbsp;For many other reasons the current world order is not sustainable.&nbsp;
A biotechnology expert would say that in its genetic map there are numerous
genes marked for its own destruction.
<P>&nbsp;New and unsuspected phenomena arise which escape the control of
governments and international financial institutions.&nbsp; It is no longer
a matter of artificially creating fabulous riches unrelated to the real
economy.&nbsp; Such is the case of hundreds of new multimillionaires who
made their fortunes when the stock prices in the United States Stock Exchanges
multiplied in the last few years, like an enormous balloon inflated to
absurd levels with the serious risk that, sooner or later, it will explode.&nbsp;
That already happened in 1929 giving rise to a deep depression that lasted
a whole decade.
<P>&nbsp;In August of this year, the simple financial crisis in Russia
which produces only 2 percent of the world's Gross Domestic Product made
the Dow Jones&nbsp; --a standard index in the New York Stock Exchange--
drop 512 points in one day.&nbsp; Panic spread.&nbsp; There was the threat
of a Southeast Asia contagion in Latin America, thus a great risk for the
US economy. So far they have been able to hold back the catastrophe but
not without great difficulties.&nbsp; Among those stocks quoted on the
Stock Exchanges are the savings and pension funds of 50 percent of Americans.&nbsp;
At the time of the 1929 crisis, it was only 5 percent and there were many
suicides.
<P>&nbsp;In a global world, whatever happens anywhere has an immediate
impact on the rest of the planet.&nbsp; The recent shock has been considerable.
Following the United States call the resources of the world's richest countries
were mobilized to put out or dampen the fire.&nbsp; However, they want
to keep Russia on the edge of the abyss and they keep imposing unnecessarily
harsh conditions to Brazil.&nbsp; The International Monetary Fund is not
moving a millimeter apart from its fundamentalist principles. The World
Bank is mutinying and denouncing.
<P>&nbsp;Everyone talks about an international financial crisis.&nbsp;
The only ones who have not heard about it are the Americans: they have
spent more than ever and their savings are below zero.&nbsp; That does
not matter, their transnational companies keep investing other people's
money.&nbsp; The growing trade deficit already amounting to 240 billion
does not matter either.&nbsp; Such are the privileges of the empire that
prints the world's reserve currency!&nbsp; In times of crisis, speculators
take refuge en masse in the Treasury bonds.&nbsp; Since the domestic market
is big and more is being spent the economy seems to be in good shape although
corporate profits have dropped.&nbsp; Megamergers; euphoria; stock prices
rise back.&nbsp; Again, the Russian roulette is the game.&nbsp; Everything
will be all right for ever.&nbsp; The system's theoreticians have discovered
the philosopher's stone!&nbsp; All access has been blocked so that no ghosts
can get in to disturb their dreams.&nbsp; It is no longer impossible to
square the circle.&nbsp; There will never be a crisis!
<P>&nbsp;But, is it perhaps the inflated balloon the only threat and the
only speculative game?&nbsp; Speculative operations with currencies constitute
a daily growing phenomenon reaching huge and uncontrollable heights. The
amount involved is at least a trillion dollars a day.&nbsp; Some say it
is 1.5 trillion.&nbsp; Barely fourteen years ago, this speculative figure
was only 150 billion in a year.&nbsp; There might be confusion with the
figures.&nbsp; They are hard to express and even harder to translate from
English into Spanish.&nbsp; What we call billon in Spanish is a trillion
in English.&nbsp; On the other hand, a billion in English equals 1,000
million in Spanish.&nbsp; Now, they have come up with the millardo which
means 1,000 million in Spanish and French. The language difficulties show
how hard it is to follow and understand the huge figures reflecting the
scope of speculation in the prevailing world economic order.&nbsp; The
vast majority of peoples in the world are paying for this with the constant
risk of a downfall.&nbsp; When they least expect it, the speculators attack
causing the devaluation of their currencies; in a matter of days they are
left without the hard currency reserves it took them perhaps decades to
accumulate. The existing world order has created the conditions for this.&nbsp;
No one is safe, absolutely no one. Supported by advanced computer software,
the packs of wolves know exactly where to attack, when and why.
<P>&nbsp;A Nobel Laureate in Economics proposed 14 years ago, when these
speculations were two thousand times lower, a 1 percent tax on every speculative
operation of this kind.&nbsp; Today, that 1 percent would bring in enough
resources to develop all the Third World countries!&nbsp; It would also
be a way of regulating and discouraging such harmful speculation.&nbsp;
But, did I say regulate?&nbsp; That contradicts the purest fundamentalist
doctrine!&nbsp; Certain words cannot be uttered in the temple of the fanatics
of the imposed world order, such as, regulation, public company, economic
development program, the least of planning and State involvement or influence
in the economy.&nbsp; All that disturbs the idyllic dream of the free market
and the private company paradise. According to them, everything must be
deregulated even the labor market.&nbsp; Unemployment benefits must be
reduced to an indispensable minimum, so as not to support "layabouts" and
"loafers", and the pension system restructured and privatized.&nbsp; The
State must only look after the police and the army to preserve law and
order, to suppress protests and make war.&nbsp; It should not even be allowed
to take part in the monetary policies of the Central Bank which must be
absolutely independent.&nbsp; Louis 14th would really hurt a lot because
if he once said: "I am the State", he would now have to say:&nbsp; "I am
absolutely nothing."
<P>&nbsp;Apart from the amazing speculation with currencies, the so-called
hedge funds are growing at an incredible and accelerated pace along with
the derivatives market&nbsp; --another rather new term.&nbsp; I will not
try to explain it.&nbsp; It is complicated.&nbsp; It would take time.&nbsp;
Suffice it to say that it is another system of speculative games, another
huge casino where they bet everything on everything based on sophisticated
risk estimates made with computers by high-level software experts and eminent
economists.&nbsp; They exploit uncertainty and use the savers money in
the banks in a practically unrestricted way.&nbsp; They can obtain huge
profits and bring about catastrophes.
<P>&nbsp;The fact that the existing economic order is untenable is proved
by the very vulnerability and weakness of the system which has turned the
planet into an enormous casino and millions of people, sometimes whole
societies, into gamblers distorting the function of money and investment,
since what they seek at all costs is not production or the increase of
the world riches but to turn money into more money.&nbsp; Such a distortion
will lead the world economy to an inevitable disaster.
<P>&nbsp;A recent event in the United States has been the source of scandal
and deep concern.&nbsp; One of the hedge funds I mentioned and tried to
basically explain, precisely the most famous in the United States&nbsp;&nbsp;
--the Long-Term Capital Management where two Nobel Prize Laureates in Economics
and some of the world's best software specialists work and where annual
profits exceed 30 percent--&nbsp; was on the brink of a bankruptcy whose
consequences would apparently have been incalculable.
<P>&nbsp;Relying on the prestige it had gained, and blindly trusting the
infallibility of its famous software specialists and Nobel Prize Laureates
in Economics, while its own funds amounted to only 4.5 billion dollars
it mobilized funds from 75 different banks amounting to 120 billion dollars
for its speculative operations. That is, it borrowed over 25 dollars for
every dollar in its own fund.&nbsp; Such action broke all the parameters
of the so-called financial practice.&nbsp; The calculations and the computers’
software failed.&nbsp; The losses were considerable; bankruptcy&nbsp; --a
dramatic word in that field--&nbsp; was inevitable.&nbsp; It was just a
matter of days. The United States Federal Reserve System came to the rescue
of the hedge fund.&nbsp; This contradicted everything the United States
preaches and the neo-liberal philosophy it upholds on the basis of what
is considered irresponsible behavior by such an institution.&nbsp; According
to common procedure, the famous hedge fund would have gone bankrupt and
the law of the market would have taught it a lesson by imposing the appropriate
punishment. The scandal broke out and the U.S. Senate summoned [Alan] Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve System, to testify.&nbsp; This senior official,
a product of Wall Street, is considered one of the most knowledgeable and
outstanding executives in the United States economy.&nbsp; He has received
most of the credit for the economic successes of the current administration
and, at the moment, he is receiving special tribute in financial circles
and the press as the man who halted the crisis in the United States stock
market by reducing the interest rates three consecutive times.&nbsp; He
is considered the most important person in the country, second only to
the President.&nbsp; Now then, this famous and appreciated chairman declared
at the Senate that if the fund was not bailed out an economic disaster
would follow afflicting the United States and the whole world.
<P>&nbsp;How sound is an economic system where the actions&nbsp; --described
as hazardous and irresponsible--&nbsp; of a speculative entity that possessed
only 4.5 billion dollars can lead the United States and the world to an
economic meltdown?
<P>&nbsp;Such weakness and failure in the immunology system would suggest
a diagnose very similar to AIDS. On this occasion I rather not elaborate
further on this. There are many other problems in the world economy.
<P>&nbsp;The prevailing order is suffering from inflation, recession, deflation,
a possible overproduction crisis and sustained falls in commodity prices.&nbsp;
Countries as wealthy as Saudi Arabia now have budget and trade deficits,
even though Saudi Arabia is a country exporting 8 million barrels of oil
a day.&nbsp; Optimistic growth forecasts are vanishing.&nbsp; There is
not the slightest idea as to how the problems of the Third World will be
solved.&nbsp; Where are the capital goods, technologies, distribution networks
and export credits they need to find markets, be competitive and export?&nbsp;
Where are the consumers of their products?&nbsp; Where will the resources
be found for health care in Africa whose 22 million HIV sufferers would
require 200 billion dollars a year at current prices to control a single
disease-?&nbsp; How many will die before a protective vaccine or a drug
to cure the disease is produced?
<P>&nbsp;The world needs a certain leadership to confront its current realities.&nbsp;
We are already six billion people on Earth.&nbsp; It is almost certain
that in only five more decades we will be 9.5 billion.&nbsp; It will be
an enormous challenge to provide food, health care, education, employment,
clothing, footwear, housing, drinking water, electric energy and transportation
to such a great number of people who will live in precisely the poorest
countries. The first thing will be to determine consumption patterns. It
is not possible to continue introducing tastes and ways of life inspired
in the squandering model of the industrial societies; it would not only
be impossible but suicidal.
<P>&nbsp;The development of the world needs to be planned and that task
cannot be left to the transnational companies and the blind, chaotic laws
of the market.&nbsp; The United Nations provide a good basis with its accumulation
of information and expertise.&nbsp; We must simply struggle to democratize
it, to put an end to dictatorship by the Security Council and within the
Council itself which should at least be expanded with new permanent members
so that the Third World is duly represented with all the prerogatives of
the current permanent members and a change of rules for decision-making.&nbsp;
The duties and authority of the General Assembly must also be expanded.
<P>&nbsp;I wish it would not be as a result of catastrophic economic crises
that solutions are found.&nbsp; Billions of people in the Third World would
be the most affected.&nbsp; A basic understanding of the technological
realities and&nbsp; the destructive power of modern weapons makes us think
about the duty to prevent that the conflicts of interests that will inevitably
break out lead to bloody wars.
<P>&nbsp;The existence of a single superpower and a stifling world economic
order make it difficult, perhaps even impossible, for a revolution like
ours to survive were it to emerge today and not when it had a mainstay
in a then bipolar world.&nbsp; That is how our country had the necessary
time to develop an invincible capacity for resistance and deploy worldwide
the strong influence of its example and heroism waging a great battle of
ideas from every rostrum.
<P>&nbsp;The peoples will struggle and the masses will play a significantly
decisive role in those struggles which will essentially be their response
to the poverty and sufferings imposed on them.&nbsp; Thousands of creative
and ingenious forms of political action and pressure will arise.&nbsp;
Many governments will be destabilized by the economic crises as they will
be trapped within the established international economic system.
<P>&nbsp;We are living times where awareness on afflicting realities is
lagging behind events.&nbsp; We must sow ideas and expose deceit, sophism
and hypocrisy with means and methods that counteract the institutional
lies and disinformation.&nbsp; The experience of 40 years of slanders falling
on Cuba like heavy rain has taught us to trust the instinct and intelligence
of the peoples.
<P>&nbsp;The countries of Europe have given the world a good example of
what can be achieved with rationality and intelligence.&nbsp; After centuries
of fighting one another they understood that even rich industrial countries
like them would not survive in isolation.&nbsp; [George] Soros, a well-known
character in the world of finances, and his group launched a speculative
attack that brought Great Britain to its knees. That country had been the
master of a great empire, the unquestioned queen of finances and owner
of the reserve currency; a role now played by the dollar and the United
States.
<P>&nbsp;The franc, the peseta and the lira also suffered the scourge of
speculation.&nbsp; The dollar and the euro are carefully watching each
other.&nbsp; A prospective adversary has emerged to challenge the privileged
US currency.&nbsp; The United States is anxiously betting on its difficulties
and failure.&nbsp; We shall follow events closely.
<P>&nbsp;In anguish, uncertainty and doubt some are looking for eclectic
alternatives.&nbsp; However, the world has no other alternative to the
morally and socially indefensible, ecologically and economically unsustainable
and inhuman neo-liberal globalization but to establish a fair distribution
of the wealth that human beings can create with their industrious hands
and fruitful intelligence. The tyranny of an order that imposes blind,
anarchic and chaotic principles leading the human species toward an abyss
must be stopped.&nbsp; Nature must be saved.&nbsp; National identities
must be preserved.&nbsp; The culture of every country must be protected.&nbsp;
Equality, fraternity and true liberty must prevail.&nbsp; The unfathomable
gap between the rich and the poor countries, and within each country, must
not continue to widen it must rather diminish until one day it ceases to
exist. Let it be the merits, the ability, the creative spirit and what
man can contribute to the well-being of humanity that determine their differences
and not theft, speculation or the exploitation of the weaker.&nbsp; A humane
spirit should truly be proclaimed, not with hypocritical words but with
deeds.
<P>Dear fellow citizens,
<P>&nbsp;The people waging a heroic struggle in the conditions of the special
period to save their homeland, the Revolution and the achievements of socialism
are adamantly advancing toward their goals like the combatants who marched
with Camilo and Che from the Sierra Maestra to the Escambray.&nbsp; As
[Julio Antonio] Mella said, any time in the future must be better.&nbsp;
This must be proven through the goals we have set ourselves for 1999. We
must consolidate our achievements, we should study, work, struggle and
fight in the spirit of our heroic comrades in Uvero, in the glorious days
of the huge enemy offensive, in the battles and the events that we have
recalled today.&nbsp; The setback at Alegria de Pio is already behind us,&nbsp;
we have passed by Cinco Palmas and rallied our forces.&nbsp; Now we are
ready to triumph just like 300 triumphed over 10,000.&nbsp; We are much
stronger now and victory is certain.&nbsp; (Applause)
<P>&nbsp;I assure you all, especially the youth, that the next 40 years
will be decisive for the world.&nbsp; You have incomparably more complex
and difficult tasks ahead of you,&nbsp; new and glorious goals. The immense
honor of being Cuban revolutionaries demands it of you.&nbsp; We will be
fighting for our people and for Mankind, and our voice will be heeded at
a great distance.
<P>&nbsp;Today's battle is hard and difficult.&nbsp; In ideological warfare
there are also casualties like in hot wars.&nbsp; Not everyone has the
heart to endure rough times and difficult conditions.
<P>&nbsp;I was reminding you today that during the war, under the bombs
and enduring all sorts of hardships, one out of every ten young volunteers
who enrolled in the school was able to withstand it but that one youth
was worth ten, a hundred, a thousand.&nbsp; Building awareness, shaping
the character, educating in the tough school of life in our times, instilling
solid ideas, using irrefutable arguments, preaching by the example and
trusting man's honor can create a situation where, out of every ten, nine
will remain at their combat position alongside the flag, alongside the
Revolution and alongside the Motherland (Applause).
