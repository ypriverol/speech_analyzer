<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Esteemed delegates, observers and guests,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You have honored me by asking but I will not make
a speech. I will limit myself to presenting a paper. (APPLAUSE) I will
do it in the style of a cablegram and it will mostly be a dialogue with
myself.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Month of July. Latin American and Caribbean Economists
Meeting. Subject: Serious world economic crisis in sight. Need to convene
an international conference. Focal point: Economic crisis and neoliberal
globalization.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Extensive debate.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Every school represented.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Exchange of arguments.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Work done along these lines.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Maximum possible reduction of expenses for everyone.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Morning, afternoon and evening sessions.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Exceptional seriousness and discipline have prevailed
during these five days.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We have all expressed ourselves in absolute freedom.
We have made it. We are grateful.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We have learned a lot from listening to you.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A great variety and diversity of ideas. An extraordinary
show of scholarly spirit and talent clearly and beautifully expressed.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We all have our convictions.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We can all influence each other.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the long run, we shall all reach similar conclusions.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">My deepest convictions: the incredible and unprecedented
globalization under discussion is a product of historical evolution, a
fruit of human civilization achieved in a very short period of time, in
no more than 3,000 years of the long presence of our ancestors on the planet.
They were already a completely developed specie. The man of today is not
more intelligent than Pericle, Plato or Aristotle, and we do not know as
yet if he is intelligent enough to solve today’s extremely complex problems.
We are betting on his doing it. That is what we have dealt with at our
meeting.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A question: Is it a reversible process? My answer,
the one I give to myself, is No.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">What kind of globalization have we today? A neoliberal
globalization, that is what many of us call it. Is it sustainable? No.
Will it be able to subsist for long? Absolutely, no. Is it a matter of
centuries? Categorically, no. Will it last only decades? Yes, only decades.
But rather sooner than later it will cease to exist.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Do I believe myself to be a sort of prophet or fortune
teller? No. Do I know much about economics? No. Hardly anything. To make
this statement it is enough to know how to add up, subtract, multiply and
divide, something children learn in grammar school.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">How will such transition take place? We do not know.
Will it be through violent revolutions or devastating wars? That seems
unlikely, irrational and suicidal. Will it be through deep and catastrophic
crises? Unfortunately, this is most likely, almost inevitable and it will
happen through many different ways and forms of struggle.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">What kind of globalization will it be? It can not
but be supportive, socialist, communist or whatever you want to call it.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Does nature, and the human specie with it, have much
time left to survive in the absence of such change? Very little time. Who
will be the builders of that new world? The men and women who inhabit our
planet.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Which will be their basic weapons? Ideas will be,
and consciousness. Who will sow them, cultivate them and make them invincible?
You will. Is it a utopia, just one more dream among so many others? No,
because it is objectively inevitable and there is no alternative to it.
It has been dreamed of before, only perhaps too early. As the most visionary
of the sons of this island, Jose Marti, said: "Today’s dreams will be tomorrow’s
realities".</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I have concluded my presentation. Now, if you wish
to raise any questions I am ready to answer.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thank you.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
