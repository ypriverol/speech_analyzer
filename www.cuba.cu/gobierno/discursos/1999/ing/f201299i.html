<p><br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The open stage in the proximity of the
United States Interest Section in Havana will resume its guiding and mobilizing
activities at 5 p.m. this Monday.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Eli&aacute;n's fate is uncertain.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Practically all of the many politicians
from both parties running for the presidential nomination have expressed
themselves demagogically or in an extravagant and reckless language against
the child's return to Cuba; they have discussed dilatory and even perfidious
formulas.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In addition to the announced technicalities
they intend to resort to as soon as the Administration makes a decision,
the extremist and terrorist South Florida mob, backed by the U.S. extreme
right, is threatening with violent actions to oppose the child's return
to his legitimate family and homeland. They claim that a human belt of
traitorous mercenaries will take position around the house of the distant
relatives where the child is being held in captivity to prevent action
by the federal officials in the event that the government of that country
adopts a decision in favor of his return to Cuba that would be both humanely
just and legally irrefutable.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As they are used to fascist methods, to
blackmail and go unpunished due to the weakness and tolerance of the U.S.
leaders for whom they were always instruments and accomplices, anything
can be expected of them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the moment, no one can know for sure
when and how the child will be returned. There is confusion and chaos in
the United States concerning this issue.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The last diplomatic note from the Cuban
government was presented to the U.S. State Department on December 12. It
stated the need for a prompt reply because of the great suffering both
the child and his family are enduring and the consequences this could have
on Eli&aacute;n's mental health. Eight days have passed and we have not
yet received a single word of reply.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On Monday, December 13, at 7:00 in the
morning, two U.S. officials --one of them a representative of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service-- had a private meeting with Elian's
father and closest relatives. This was considered an indispensable requirement,
practically the last step towards a fair, quick and honorable solution
of the problem.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the family's home, in the city of C&aacute;rdenas,
the father gave these U.S. officials 17 documents certified by the relevant
authorities, which proved beyond all doubt the paternity and, therefore,
the parental authority of Juan Miguel Gonz&aacute;lez Quintana, whose care
for and behavior toward his son Eli&aacute;n were unquestionably exemplary.
These same immigration authorities had handed over the boy to a distant
relative who has lived in the United States for 15 years --having gone
there nine years before the birth of Eli&aacute;n, whom he had seen perhaps
only once in his life-- without any request for documents to confirm the
distant kinship. This time seven days have passed and the father has not
yet received the slightest sign that his rights will be recognized.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Along with all this, the touching and impressive
Round Table held last Thursday with the participation of outstanding scientists
and specialists in pedagogy, psychology and child psychiatry chosen from
among the most prestigious and experienced in the country, offered scientifically
sound arguments that showed to the whole country that, in less than 48
hours, the child had suffered deep successive traumas. Also, that he had
been estranged from his natural environment, his school, his friends, his
teacher, his father and his loved ones most needed for his recovery. Our
scientists and specialists proved how desperately urgent is his return
to Cuba.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The absolutely shameful and obnoxious images
of those who took part in the child’s abduction in complicity with a gang
of perverse, unscrupulous and vicious people were extremely annoying and
revolting. The grotesque scene where a fierce she-wolf disguised as a woman
wrapped around that innocent boy, almost by force, the striped and spangled
banner --so different from the one he had respectfully saluted a few days
before in his school every morning-- shall go down in history as one of
the most infamous, loathsome and outrageous acts ever seen by our people.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One hundred books of political teachings
could not be more instructive about the meanness and decadence of the "turbulent
and brutal empire that scorns us". That image should be disseminated throughout
the world. The hypocrisy, the blatant and incredible boasting of ostentatious
presents with which they want to buy out the soul of a six-year-old boy
at any cost, are a reflection of the alienated society and the world that
they want to impose on this Cuban child arbitrarily and by force.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now, it is not only necessary to preserve
the child's identity and his father's parental authority, something that
no one in the world puts in doubt; it is also urgent to save his psychic
and mental health before the damage becomes irreversible.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our people will not permit the gruesome
and monstrous crime being coldly and shamefully committed against that
child before the world's astonished eyes.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are beginning today the second stage
of the mass battle we have been waging since Sunday, December 5. It has
been and still is a battle of ideas, of national and international public
opinion, of legal, ethical and humane principles, between the empire and
Cuba, backed by one of the largest and most combative mobilizations ever
to take place in our history.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Revolution has assigned the children
of primary and secondary school, the students of middle and higher education
and the young manual and intellectual workers of the country the mission
to be in the frontline of this great battle waged with the unanimous support
of the people.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This new stage of the struggle may be long.
Thus, it is required, now more than ever, that a rigorous organization
and strict discipline prevail together with intelligent and flexible planning,
creativity and the ability to adapt to constantly changing situations.
We need to act calmly, with equanimity and sang-froid.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are confronting a powerful, tenacious
and arrogant adversary. The most serious risk is that the naturally militant
spirit, human solidarity and justified irritation of our people might overflow
the principles of discipline and organization.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Under these circumstances, only those convened
by the organizers should be involved in the marches, rallies or functions.
It is not at all convenient that 20,000, 100,000, 200,000 people show up
where 10,000, 50,000 or 100,000 were expected; in other words, two or three
times more than those called upon in each area or sector. In the Fighting
People March, 300,000 were supposed to participate, but in the end more
than half a million people took part, and they flowed in from everywhere.
Thus, our activities could become disorganized and our great strength and
energy wasted. We must not exhaust ourselves but rather save that strength
and energy, renew them constantly and use them in an orderly fashion when
necessary and immediately replace them if need be.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">While thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds
of thousands, even millions of us muster up, as on December 9 and 10 when
from Thursday afternoon to Friday the same time almost three million people
were mobilized –and this is still far from our true potential, since to
preserve its forces the City of Havana mobilized barely 10% percent of
its potential on the day of the major demonstrations in the provincial
capitals-- we must preserve production and services at all costs, with
more tenacity and responsibility than ever.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our action must be qualitatively superior:
persuasive and convincing for the international public opinion; surprising,
disconcerting, timely and overwhelming for the small but powerful minority
within U.S. society that opposes Eli&aacute;n's return.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our people have a very high political culture;
they are united, cohesive and organized. We all belong to one or several
organizations, from the children’s (pioneers) organization to the veterans
of forty years of revolutionary struggle. We are all trained in combat
to a greater or lesser extent. We all share in the revolutionary strength,
the patriotism and the noble objectives that bind us together as brothers
and sisters. We all have the privilege of a united country. We can and
we must act like a huge invincible army.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That is why, fellow countrymen and women,
on resuming its arduous combat the Revolution, which has accumulated great
experience in more than 40 years of successful confrontation with the strongest
power ever to exist, does not simply appeal to us for discipline, but it
demands it.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are asking the Cuban students and youths,
who have received the great honor of a place in the frontline and who have
acted so brilliantly from the very first moments, to be an example of conscientious
and revolutionary discipline in this crucial and heroic struggle that the
Revolution demands from everyone to save Eli&aacute;n. He is a small child,
a schoolboy, a grandson and a son of all of Cuba; to save him is like saving
a symbol of the billions of children that should be educated, fed and given
the opportunity of a healthy and dignified life in this world. The enemy,
intent on committing a stupid, repugnant and loathsome injustice, will
not be able to withstand our morale, our truth and our irrepressible forces
in the struggle for this claim backed by justice and they will have no
alternative but to return Eli&aacute;n as soon as possible.</font>
