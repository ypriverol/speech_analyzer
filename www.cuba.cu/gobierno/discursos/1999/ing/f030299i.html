Fidel Castro Ruz, President of the Republic of Cuba, at the main lecture
hall in the Central University of Venezuela, on 3 February, 1999.</FONT></B>

<P><BR>
<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">TO ALL THOSE KIND AND PATIENT ENOUGH TO READ THIS
MATERIAL</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This speech, delivered at the main lecture hall of
the University of Venezuela, is especially significant for me. I delivered
it just a month and a half ago, on February 3, 1999.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I do not know how many mortals have had such a special
and unique experience as I lived that afternoon.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">After a spectacular political victory and supported
by a gulf of people, a new young President had been inaugurated only 24
hours before. During the visit I paid to that country on the occasion,
together with many other guests, the authorities and students of the aforementioned
university insisted that I deliver what people call a Master Lecture. The
sole qualifier is embarrassing and gives rise to angst, especially to those
of us who are not academics nor have mastered anything beyond the humble
craft of using words to say what we think in our own personal way and style.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">After overcoming my perennial resistance to such
adventures, I agreed to the engagement, always risky and delicate for someone
who, as an official guest, visits a country in full political excitement.
Furthermore, I was inexorably compelled by the unchanged solidarity towards
Cuba of those inviting me to speak. I had been there once already and never
forgot it. I felt as if I was going to meet the same people again.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Only as I was about to leave for the campus something
struck my mind: time goes by and we do not realize it.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Exactly forty years and ten days had gone by since
I had had the privilege of speaking to the students in the imposing main
lecture hall of the same militant and prestigious University of Venezuela,
on January 24, 1959. One day before, on January 23, 1959 that year, I had
arrived in Venezuela. It was the first anniversary of the people’s triumph
over an authoritarian military government. Only three weeks before we had
achieved our own revolutionary triumph on January 1<SUP>st</SUP>, 1959.
A huge crowd awaited me at the airport and followed me everywhere during
my stay. There was no difference with the experience lived in my own homeland.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I am trying to recall precisely what was going on
inside of me. Such a rich mixture of ideas, feelings, and emotions coming
from my mind and from my heart! In that confusion of recollections I rather
rely on logic than on my memory.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I was 32 years old. In 24 months and 13 days we had
overcome a force of 80 thousand men; we had started with 7 rifles, gathered
after the great setback of our small group of 82 men, three days after
our landing, on December 2, 1956.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Full of ideas and dreams but still very inexperienced,
we took part in a gigantic rally held on January 23 at Plaza del Silencio.
The next day we visited the National University, a traditional bulwark
of the Venezuelan people's intelligence, rebelliousness and struggles.
Personally, I still felt like the young graduate who had left the university
only 8 years before. Since the treacherous March 10, 1952 coup d’&eacute;tat,
we had spent almost 7 of those 8 years preparing for armed rebellion, in
prison, in exile, in our return and successful warfare, without ever losing
touch with our university students.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">That time I spoke to University professors and students
of liberating the oppressed peoples of Our America. Now I was coming back
with the same revolutionary fever and 40 years of experience in the epic
struggle of our people against the mightiest and most selfish power ever.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Nevertheless, I was facing a great challenge. These
were other University professors and students, another Venezuela and another
world. What did these young people think? What would their concerns be?
To what extent did they agree or disagree with the current process? To
what extent were they aware of the objective situation in the world and
their own country? I had accepted the kind and friendly invitation upon
arrival in Venezuela two days before. I did not even have the minimum amount
of time to inform myself properly. What were their interests? What was
I going to tell them? How much freedom to speak could a state guest have
when attending the inauguration of a new government? I felt compelled by
a fundamental respect for the sovereignty and pride of the country that
began our wars of independence to avoid interference in its domestic affairs.
How would the most diverse social media, institutions and political parties
interpret my words? Still, I had no other choice but to talk and I had
to do it with complete honesty.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">With some facts in mind, four or five pages of references
that had to be typed for exact quoting and three or four basic ideas, I
headed resolutely for my meeting with the students. I had been asked to
hold the rally outdoors so that there would be more space. I insisted on
the convenience of meeting indoors, in the main lecture hall, as the ideal
place –in my opinion- to meditate and communicate.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When I reached the campus I saw thousands of chairs
in different open spaces, full of students who, in front of huge screens,
wanted to watch the lecture. The 2800 seats of the main lecture hall were
occupied. The ordeal began. I spoke with candor and, at the same time,
with full respect for the rules I felt I should respect. I expressed my
essential ideas. In summary: what I think about neo-liberal globalization
and how absolutely unsustainable the economic order imposed on humankind
is, both socially and environmentally. Also its origin designed by imperialist
interests and encouraged by the progress of productive forces and scientific
and technological breakthroughs as well as its temporary nature and inevitable
demise for historical reasons. Likewise, the swindling of the world and
the unimaginable privileges usurped by the United States. A special emphasis
was made on the significance of ideas and the demoralization and uncertainty
of neo-liberal theoreticians. The strategies and tactics for struggle,
probable course of events and our full confidence in man’s ability to survive
were also analyzed.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Here and there I told anecdotes, stories, and small
autobiographical references that came up spontaneously in the course of
my reflections; that was the absolutely non-Master Lecture I gave. With
my usual passion and devotion and greater conviction than ever, I shared
the ideas I uphold with cold and reflexive fanaticism. As a combatant who
during the long 1959-99 period has not stopped fighting for a minute, I
had had the rare privilege of meeting in a historical and renowned University
with two different generations of students in two radically different worlds.
Both times I was received with the same warmth and respect.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">After all the emotions I have lived through I should
have been accustomed, but I was not.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Hours had gone by. At the end, I promised that when
we meet again, in forty years time, I would be briefer. Many from the enthusiastic
and militant crowd stayed in their seats until the end following my words
with interest and attention; others left. Perhaps, it was too late. I shall
never forget that meeting.</FONT>

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I do not have a written speech, unfortunately (LAUGHTER),
but I brought some notes that I thought would be useful for the sake of
precision. Still, I have realized that a booklet is missing, one that I
had read, underlined, noted with great care and then... left at my hotel.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) I have sent for it, and I hope they find it because
this copy here is not underlined.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At least I should address this audience formally,
shouldn’t I? (LAUGHTER) I am not going to make a long list of the many
excellent friends we have here. (SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE SAYS: "WE CANNOT
HEAR!") Listen, I do not have that much voice (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) and
if I start shouting... I thought there were better microphones here. (LAUGHTER)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">How many of you cannot hear over there? Please, raise
you hands. (HANDS RAISED) If someone does not fix this, we can invite you
to sit around here or some place where you can hear. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I am going to try to get closer to this small microphone,
right? But allow me to begin properly.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Dear friends, (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I was going to say that today, February 3, 1999,
it is 40 years and 10 days to this day that I first visited this university
and we met in this same place. Of course, you understand that I am moved
--without the melodrama you find in certain soap operas at the moment--
(LAUGHTER) as it would have been unimaginable then that one day, so many
years later, I would return to this place.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Several weeks ago, on January 1<SUP>st</SUP>, 1999,
on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the triumph of the Revolution,
I stood on the same balcony where I had spoken on January 1<SUP>st</SUP>,
1959 in Santiago de Cuba. I was reflecting with the audience gathered there
that the people of today are not the same people who were there at the
time because of the 11 million Cubans we are today, 7 190 000 were born
after that date. I said that they were two different people and yet, one
and the same eternal people of Cuba.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I also reminded them that the immense majority of
those who were 50 years old then are no longer alive, and that those who
were children at that time are over 40 today.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">So many changes, so many differences, and how special
it was for us to think that there was the people that had started a profound
revolution when they were practically illiterate, when 30% of adults could
not read or write and perhaps an additional 50% had not reached fifth grade.
We estimated that with a population of almost 7 million, possibly little
over 150 000 people had gone beyond fifth grade while today the university
graduates alone amount to 600 000, and there are almost 300 thousand teachers
and professors.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I told my fellow countrymen --in paying tribute to
the people who had achieved that first great triumph 40 years before--
that in spite of an enormous educational backwardness, they had been able
to undertake and defend an extraordinary revolutionary feat. Something
else: Probably their political culture was lower than their educational
level.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Those were times of brutal anti-communism, the final
years of McCarthyism, when by all possible means our powerful and imperial
neighbor had tried to sow in the minds of our noble people all possible
lies and prejudices. Oftentimes, I would meet a common citizen and ask
him a number of questions: whether he believed we should undertake a land
reform; whether it would be fair for families to own the homes for which
at times they paid big landlords almost half their salaries. Also if he
believed that it was right that all those banks where the people’s money
was deposited should be owned by the people in order to finance with those
resources the development of the country instead of being owned by private
institutions. Whether those big factories –-most of them foreign-owned--
should belong to, and produce for, the people... things like that. I could
ask ten, fifteen similar questions and he would agree absolutely: "Yes,
it would be great."</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In essence, if all those big stores and all those
profitable business that only enriched their privileged owners belonged
to the people and were used to enrich the people, would you agree? "Yes,
yes, he would answer immediately. He agreed completely with each of these
simple proposals. So, then I asked him: "Would you agree with socialism?
(APPLAUSE) Answer: "Socialism? No, no, no, not with socialism." Let alone
communism... There was so much prejudice that this was an even more scaring
word.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Revolutionary legislation was what contributed the
most to creating a socialist consciousness in our people. Then, it was
that very people –-illiterate or semi-illiterate at the beginning-- who
had to start by teaching many of its children to read and write. The same
people that out of love for liberty and yearning for justice had overthrown
the tyranny and carried out, and heroically defended, the most profound
social revolution in this Hemisphere.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1961, only two years after the triumph, with the
support of young students working as teachers about 1 million people learned
how to read and write. They went to the countryside, to the mountains,
the remotest places and there they taught people that were even 80 years
old how to read and write. Later on, there were follow-up courses and the
necessary steps were taken in a constant effort to attain what we have
today. A revolution can only be born from culture and ideas.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">No people become revolutionary by force. Those who
sow ideas have no need to suppress the people ever. Weapons in the hands
of that same people are used to fight those abroad who try to take away
their achievements.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Forgive me for touching on this issue because I did
not come here to preach socialism or communism and I do not want to be
misinterpreted. Nor did I come here to propose radical legislation or anything
of the sort. I was simply reflecting on our experience that showed us the
importance of ideas, the importance of believing in man, the importance
of trusting the people. This is extremely important when mankind is facing
such complicated and difficult times.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Naturally, on January 1<SUP>st</SUP> this year in
Santiago de Cuba it was fitting to acknowledge, in a very special way,
that that Revolution which had managed to survive 40 years and mark this
anniversary without folding its banners, without surrendering, was mainly
the work of the people gathered there, young people and mature men and
women. They had received their education under the Revolution and were
capable of that feat, thus writing pages of noble and well-earned glory
for our nation and our brothers and sisters in the Americas.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We could say that thanks to the efforts of three
generations of Cubans, vis-a-vis the mightiest power, the biggest empire
ever in Man's history, this sort of miracle came true: that a small country
would undergo such an ordeal and achieve victory.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Our even greater recognition went to those countrymen
who in the past 10 years –-the latest 8 years, to be precise-- had been
willing to withstand the double blockade resulting from the collapse of
the socialist camp and the demise of the USSR which left our neighbor as
the sole superpower in a unipolar world, unrivalled in the political, economic,
military, technological and cultural fields. I do not mean the value of
their culture but rather the tremendous power they exercise to impose their
culture on the rest of the world. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">However, it was unable to defeat a united people,
a people armed with just ideas, a people endowed with a great political
consciousness because that is most important for us. We have resisted everything
and are ready to continue resisting for as long as need be (APPLAUSE) thanks
to the seeds planted throughout those decades, thanks to the ideas and
the consciousness developed during that time.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It has been our best weapon and it shall remain so,
even in nuclear times. Now that I mention it, we even had experiences related
to that type of weapons because at a given moment, who knows how many bombs
and how many nuclear missiles were aimed at our small island during the
well-known Missile Crisis in October 1962. Even in times of smart weapons
--which sometimes make mistakes and strike 100 or 200 km away from their
targets (LAUGHTER) but which have a certain degree of precision-- man’s
intelligence will always be greater than any of these sophisticated weapons.
(APPLAUSE AND EXCLAMATIONS)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The type of fight becomes a matter of concepts. The
defense doctrine of our nation, which feels stronger today as it has perfected
these concepts, is based on the conclusion that at the end –-the end of
our invaders-- it would be a body combat, a man-to-man and a woman-to-invader
combat, whether man or woman. (PROLONGED APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We have had to wage, and will have to continue waging,
a more difficult battle against that extremely powerful empire: a ceaseless
ideological battle that they stepped up with all their resources after
the collapse of the socialist camp when fully confident in our ideas we
decided to continue forward. More than that, to continue forward alone;
and when I say alone I am thinking of state entities, without ever forgetting
the immense and invincible support and solidarity of the peoples which
we always had and which makes us feel under a greater obligation to struggle.
(APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We have accomplished honorable internationalist missions.
Over 500 000 Cubans have taken part in such hard and difficult missions.
The children of that people which could not read or write developed such
a high consciousness that they shed their sweat, and even their blood,
for other peoples; in short, for any people in the world. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When the special period began we said: "Now, our
first internationalist duty is to defend this bulwark". We meant what Mart&iacute;
had described in the last words he wrote the day before his death, when
he said that the main objective of his struggle had to go undeclared in
order to be accomplished. Mart&iacute;, who was not only a true believer
in his ideas but also a wholehearted follower of Bol&iacute;var's, (APPLAUSE)
had set himself an objective. According to his own words, it was "to timely
prevent with the independence of Cuba that the United States should expand
itself over the Antilles and fall, with this additional might, on our lands
in the Americas. Everything I have done up so far, and everything I will
do, is for this purpose." (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It was his political will and he expressed his life's
aspiration: to prevent the fall of that first trench which the northern
neighbors had so many times tried to occupy. That trench is still there,
and will continue to be there, with a people willing to fight to death
to prevent the fall of that trench of the Americas. (APPLAUSE) The people
there is capable of defending even the last trench, and whoever defends
the last trench and prevents anyone from taking it begins, at that very
moment, to attain victory. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Comrades, if you allow me to call you that. That
is what we are at this moment and I also believe that here, at this moment,
we are defending a trench. (APPLAUSE) And trenches of ideas –-forgive me
for quoting Mart&iacute; again-- are worth, as he said, more than trenches
of stones. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We must discuss ideas here, and so I go back to what
I was saying. Many things have happened in these 40 years but the most
transcendental is that the world has changed. This world of today in which
I am talking to you --to those who had not been born then, and many were
far from being born at the time-- does not resemble the world of those
days.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I tried to find a newspaper where there might be
a note on that rally at the university. Fortunately, we do have the complete
text of the speech delivered at Plaza del Silencio. The revolutionary fever
we had come down with from the mountains only a few days before accompanied
us when speaking of revolutionary processes in Latin America and focusing
on the liberation of the Dominican people from Trujillo’s clutches. I believe
that issue took most of the time --or a good part of the time of that meeting--
with a tremendous enthusiasm shared by all.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Today, that would not be an issue. Today, there is
not one particular people to liberate. Today, there is not one particular
people to save. Today, a whole world, all of mankind needs to be liberated
and saved. (APPLAUSE) And it is not our task, it is <I>your</I> task. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There was not a unipolar world at that time, a single,
hegemonistic superpower. Today, the world and all mankind are under the
domination of an enormous superpower. Nonetheless, we are convinced that
we will win the battle (APPLAUSE) without panglossian optimism -–I believe
that is a word writers sometimes use (LAUGHTER). I believe so because you
can be sure that if you drop this notebook (SHOWING IT) it will fall in
a second, that if this table were not here, this notebook would be on the
floor. And the table on which this mighty superpower ruling a unipolar
world is objectively standing, is disappearing. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">These are objective reasons, and I am sure mankind
will provide all the indispensable subjective ones. For this, neither nuclear
weapons nor big wars are necessary but ideas. (APPLAUSE) This I say on
behalf of that small country we mentioned before, which has struggled staunchly
and unhesitatingly for 40 years. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You were saying, calling –-to my embarrassment--
the name by which I am known, I mean "Fidel", because I do not have any
other title actually. I understand that protocol demands the use of "His
Excellency the President" and so on and so forth. (APPLAUSE AND CALLS OF
FIDEL! FIDEL!) When I heard you chanting: "Fidel! Fidel! What is it with
Fidel that Americans cannot put him down?" I had an idea. So I turned to
my neighbor on the right, I mean on the right in terms of geography, (LAUGHTER
AND EXCLAMATIONS) there are some people making signs I do not understand,
but I say that all of us are in the same combat unit. (APPLAUSE) So, I
told him: "Well, actually what they should be asking is: What is it with
the Americans that cannot put him down? (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) And, that
instead of saying "him" when asking: "What is it with the Americans that
cannot put him down? They could say: "What is with the Americans that cannot
put Cuba down?" It would be more accurate. (APPLAUSE) I realize words are
used to symbolize ideas. That is the way I have always understood it. I
never take credit, nor can I take credit, for that myself. (EXCLAMATIONS
OF "LONG LIVE FIDEL!")</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Yes, we all hope to live long, all of us! (APPLAUSE)
In the ideas that we believe and in the conviction that those following
in our steps will carry them forward. However, your task --it should be
said-- will be more difficult than ours.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I was saying that we are living in a very different
world. This is the first thing we need to understand; then, I was explaining
certain political characteristics. Furthermore, the world is globalized,
really globalized, a world dominated by the ideology, the standards and
the principles of neo-liberal globalization.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In our view, globalization is nobody’s whim; it is
not even anybody’s invention. Globalization is a law of history. It is
a consequence of the development of the productive forces --excuse me,
please, for using this phrase which might still scare some due to its authorship--
it is a consequence of scientific and technologic development, so much
so that even the author of this phrase, Karl Marx, (APPLAUSE) who had great
confidence in human talent, possibly was unable to imagine it.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Certain other things remind me of some of the basic
ideas of that thinker among great thinkers. It comes to one’s mind that
even what he conceived as an ideal for human society could never come true
--and this is increasingly clear-- if it was not in a globalized world.
Not for a second did he think that in the tiny island of Cuba –-just to
give you an example-- a socialist society, or the building of socialism
would be attempted, least of all so near to such a powerful capitalist
neighbor.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">But, yes, we have tried. Furthermore, we made it
and we have defended it. And we have also known 40 years of blockade, threats,
aggression, and sufferings.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Today, since we are the only ones, all the propaganda,
all the mass media mastering the world are used by the United States in
the ideological and political warfare against our revolutionary process
in the same way as it uses its immense power in all fields --mainly the
economic-- and its international political influence in the economic warfare
against Cuba.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We say "blockade", but blockade does not mean much.
I wish it were an economic blockade! What our country has been enduring
for a long time is true economic warfare. Do you want evidence? You can
go anywhere in the world, any factory owned by an American company, to
buy a cap or a kerchief to export to Cuba. Even if produced by nationals
of the country in question with raw materials originated in the same country,
the United States government thousands of miles away, bans the sale of
such a cap or kerchief. Is that blockade or economic warfare?</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Do you want an additional example? If by any chance
one of you wins the lottery -–I do not know if you have lottery here--
or finds a treasure, that is possible, and decides to build a small factory
in Cuba, you can be sure of receiving very soon the visit of a senior American
diplomat, perhaps even the ambassador himself. He will try to persuade
you, put pressure or threaten with reprisals so that you do not invest
your little treasure in a small factory in Cuba. Is it blockade or economic
warfare?</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Neither does it allow the sale of medicine to Cuba,
even if that medicine is indispensable to save a life, and we have had
many examples of such cases.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We have withstood that warfare and like in all battles
-–whether military, political or ideological-- there are casualties. There
are those who may be confused, some really are, softened or weakened by
a combination of economic difficulties, material hardships, the parading
of luxury in consumer societies and the nicely sweetened but rotten ideas
about the fabulous advantages of their economic system, based on the mean
notion that man is an animal moved only by a carrot or when beaten with
a whip. We might say that their whole ideological strategy is based on
this.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There are casualties, but also, like in all battles
and struggles, other people gain experience, fighters become veterans,
multiply their qualities and help preserve and increase the morale and
strength needed to continue fighting.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We are winning the battle of ideas. (APPLAUSE) Still,
the battlefield is not limited to our small island, although the small
island has to fight. Today, the world is the battlefield; it is everywhere,
in all continents, in all institutions, in every forum. This is the good
side of the globalized struggle. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) We must defend
the small island while fighting throughout the huge world they dominate
or try to dominate. In many fields they dominate it almost exclusively
but not in all fields, nor in the same way, nor in absolutely every country.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They have discovered very intelligent weapons but
we, the revolutionaries, have discovered an even more powerful weapon,
more powerful: man thinks and feels. (APPLAUSE) We have learned that around
the world, in the countless internationalist missions we have discharged
in one field or another throughout the world. Suffice it to mention a single
figure: 26 000 Cuban doctors have taken part in them.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The country that was left with only 3000 out of the
6000 doctors it had at the triumph of the Revolution, many of them unemployed
but always wanting to migrate to obtain such and such income and salaries.
The Revolution has been able to multiply those 3000 who stayed by training
more and more doctors from those who began studying first or second grade
in the schools immediately established throughout the country after the
Revolution. These people have such a spirit of sacrifice and solidarity
that 26000 of them have accomplished internationalist missions (APPLAUSE)
just as other hundreds of thousands Cubans have worked as professionals,
teachers, constructors and combatants. Yes, combatants, and we take pride
in saying this (APPLAUSE) because fighting against the fascist and racist
soldiers of apartheid and contributing to the victory of African peoples
to whom that system was the greatest insult is, and will forever be, a
reason to feel proud. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">But in this ignored -–highly ignored-- effort we
have learned a lot from peoples. We have come to know those peoples and
their extraordinary qualities. Among other things we have learned, not
only through abstract notions but also in ordinary everyday life, that
all men may not be equal in their features but all men are equal in their
talents, feelings and other virtues. This proves that, in terms of moral,
social, intellectual and human abilities, all men are genetically equal.
(APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Many have made the big mistake of taking themselves
for a superior race.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I was saying that life has taught us many things,
and this is what nurtures our faith in the people, our faith in man. We
did not read this in a little book, we have lived through it; we have had
the privilege of living through it. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I have elaborated a bit on these first ideas because
of the lost booklet and the microphone problems (LAUGHTER) so I will have
to be briefer on other topics. Yes, I should to be briefer, among other
things, for personal reasons. Later, I will have to revisit what I said
here, (LAUGHTER) check if a comma or a dot are missing, if any data was
wrong. I can assure you that for every hour of speech -–which may seem
easy-- two and three hours of revision are needed, going over it once again.
A word might be missing. I never remove an idea I have expressed but at
times I have to complete it or add a supplementary concept because oral
language differs from written language. If I point out to my neighbor,
whoever reads it in a paper does not understand anything, (LAUGHTER) or
almost anything. Written language only has exclamation and quotation marks
(LAUGHTER) while the tone, the hands, the soul you put into things cannot
be put in writing.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I realized this difference and now we take good care
in transcribing and reviewing papers because the issues we discuss can
be important, objectively speaking. Besides, one needs to be extremely
careful with a great number of things you cannot even think of.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At a given moment, while I was thinking of the rally
I was going to have with you at 5 p.m., I asked myself: What am I going
to tell the students? (APPLAUSE) I cannot mention any names, with few exceptions.
I can hardly mention any country because at times when I say something
in the best of intentions to illustrate an idea I run the risk of being
immediately misquoted and then broadcast throughout the world creating
a lot of diplomatic problems. (APPLAUSE) And since we have to work together
in this global struggle, we cannot make it easy for the enemy and its well-designed
and efficient propaganda mechanisms to carry out their permanent work of
planting confusion and misinformation. They have done a lot already but
not enough, you see? (LAUGHTER) I have to limit myself a lot for these
reasons and I apologize for it.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There is no need here for an extensive explanation
on what neo-liberalism is all about. How can I summarize it? Well, I would
say this, for instance: Neo-liberal globalization wants to turn all countries,
especially all our countries, into private property.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">What will be left for us of their enormous resources?
Because they have accumulated an immense wealth not only looting and exploiting
the world but also working the miracle alchemists longed for in the Middle
Ages: turning paper into gold. At the same time, they have turned gold
into paper (LAUGHTER) and with it they buy everything, everything but souls
--more accurately said-- everything but the overwhelming majority of souls.
They buy natural resources, factories, whole communication systems, services,
and so on. They are buying even land around the world assuming that being
cheaper than in their own countries it is a good investment for the future.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I wonder: What is it they are going to leave us after
turning us practically into second class citizens -–pariahs would be a
more precise term-- in our own countries? They want to turn the world into
a huge free-trade zone, it might be more clearly understood this way because,
what is a free-trade zone? It is a place with special characteristics where
taxes are not paid; where raw materials, spare parts and components are
brought in and assembled or various goods produced, especially in labor-intensive
sectors. At times, they pay not more than 5% of the salary they must pay
in their own countries and the only thing they leave us with are these
meager salaries.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Sadder still: I have seen how they have put many
of our countries to compete with one another by favoring who offer more
advantages and tax exemptions to investments. They have put many Third
World countries to compete with one another for investments and free-trade
zones.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There are countries --I know them-- enduring such
poverty and unemployment that they have had to establish dozens of free-trade
zones as an option within the established world order. It is this or not
having even free-trade zone factories and jobs with certain salaries, even
if these amount to only 7%, 6%, 5% or less of the salaries the owners of
those factories would have to pay in the countries they come from.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We stated this at the World Trade Organization, in
Geneva, several months ago. They want to turn us into a huge free-trade
zone, yes, that precisely, then with their money and technologies they
will start buying everything. It remains to be seen how many airlines will
remain national property, how many shipping lines, how many services will
remain the property of the people or the nations.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">That is the future we are offered by the neo-liberal
globalization. But you should not think that is offered to the workers
only. It is also being offered to the national businessmen and to the small
and medium-size owners. They will have to compete with the transnational
companies technologies, with their sophisticated equipment, and their world-wide
distribution networks; then, look for markets without the substantial trade
credits their powerful competitors can use to sell their products.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We in Cuba can have a great factory, let’s say a
fridge factory. We have one but it is not great and it is far from being
the most modern in the world. It suits us well down there, of course, with
warm weather raising in the tropics. Let us assume that other Third World
countries manufacture fridge of acceptable quality and even at a lower
cost. Their powerful competitors constantly renew their designs, invest
huge sums of money to lend prestige to their trade marks, manufacture in
many free-trade zones paying low wages or anywhere else, tax-free. They
also have abundant capital or financial mechanisms for credits that can
be repaid in 1, 2 or 3 years, whatever. They dump the market with electric
appliances produced in a world riddled with anarchy and chaos in the distribution
of investment capital, under the generalized motto of export-based growth
and development, as the IMF advises.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">What space is there left for national industries?
How can they export and to whom? Where are the potential consumers among
the billions of poor, hungry and unemployed living in a large part of the
globe? Shall we have to wait until all of them can buy a fridge, a TV set,
a telephone, an air conditioner, a car, a PC, a house, a garage, fuel and
electricity or until they get an unemployment subsidy, market shares and
a safe pension? Is that the path leading to development, as they tell us
millions of times by all possible means? What will happen to the domestic
market if the accelerated reduction of customs barriers -–an important
source of budget revenues in many Third World countries-- is imposed on
them?</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Neo-liberal theoreticians have been unable to solve,
for instance, the serious problem of unemployment in most of the rich countries,
let alone the developing countries, and they shall never find a solution
under such a ridiculous conception. It is a huge contradiction in the system
that the more they invest and resort to technology, the more people are
left jobless. Labor productivity and the most sophisticated equipment born
out of human talent multiply material wealth as well as poverty and layoffs,
what good are they to mankind? Perhaps to help reduce working hours, have
more time for resting, leisure, sports, cultural and scientific upgrading?
That is impossible because the sacred market laws and competition patterns
--increasingly more imaginary than real-- in a world of transnationals
and megamerges do not allow it at all. Anyway, who are competing and against
whom? Monopoly-and-merger-oriented giants against giants. There is not
a place or a corner in the world for the other alleged players in this
competition. For wealthy countries, state-of-the-art industries; for Third
World workers, manufacturing jeans, tee-shirts, garments, shoes; planting
flowers, exotic fruits and other products increasingly demanded in industrialized
societies because they cannot be grown there. We know that in the United
States, for instance, they even grow marijuana in greenhouses (LAUGHTER
AND APPLAUSE) or in courtyards, and that the value of the marijuana produced
in that country is higher than all their corn production, although they
are the biggest corn producers in the world. (LAUGHTER) In the long run,
their laboratories are, or will wind up being, the biggest narcotics producers
in the globe, for the time being under the label of sedatives, anti-depressants
and other types of tablets and products which young people have learned
to combine and mix in various ways.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the happy developed world, tough agricultural
tasks like picking tomatoes -–for which a perfect machine has not yet been
invented, a robot capable of picking them according to ripeness, size and
other characteristics-- cleaning the streets and other unpleasant jobs
that nobody wants to do in consumer societies, how do they solve this?
Oh! That is what Third World immigrants are for! They themselves do not
do that type of work.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">For those of us turned foreigners inside our own
borders -–as I already said-- what they leave is the manufacturing of blue
jeans and things like that. Under their "wonderful" economic laws, they
make us produce blue jeans as if the world population already was 40 billion
and every person had enough money to buy a pair of jeans. I am not criticizing
the garment; it is very becoming to young people, more so in the case of
young women. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) No, no, I am not criticizing the garment
I am criticizing the jobs they want to leave for us and that has absolutely
nothing to do with high technology. So, our universities will become redundant
and be left to train low cost technical staff for the developed world.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You may have read in the press these days that the
United States, in view of the needs of their computer, electronic, etc.,
etc. industries has decided to acquire in the international market -–actually
the Third World-- and grant visas to 200 000 highly-skilled workers for
their state-of-the-art industries. You had better be careful because they
are looking for trained people. (LAUGHTER) This time it is not to pick
tomatoes. They are not very literate, and many people can see this when
they confuse Brazil with Bolivia or Bolivia with Brazil, (LAUGHTER AND
APPLAUSE) or when surveys show that they do not even know many things about
the very United States. They do not even know if a Latin American country
they have heard of is in Africa or Europe, and this is not an overstatement.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) They do not have all the geniuses or highly skilled
workers for their state-of-the-art industries, so they come to our world
and recruit a few who are then lost for our countries, forever.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Where are the best scientists of our countries, in
which laboratories? Which of our countries has laboratories for all the
scientists it could train? How much can we pay that scientist and how much
can they pay?</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Where are they? I know many outstanding Latin Americans
who are there. Who trained them? Oh! Venezuela, Guatemala, Brazil, Argentina,
any Latin American country did but they have no possibilities in their
homeland. Industrialized countries have the monopoly of laboratories and
the money. They recruit them and take them away from poor nations. But
not only scientists, athletes too. They would like to buy our baseball
players the way slaves were sold on one of those stands, I do not remember
what they are called... (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They are treacherous. Since there is always a soul
to be tempted. So says the Bible and that referring to the first human
beings that were supposed to be better, right? Because supposedly they
were not so wicked nor were they familiar with consumer societies. In those
days there was no dollar. All of a sudden, even an athlete who is not absolutely
first rate, gets paid a couple of millions, or four, five or six millions,
he is given an enormous publicity and since Big League batters seem to
be so bad, they have some success. I mean no offense for American professional
athletes; they are hard working, highly motivated people. Also a commodity
bought and sold in the market, although at a high price, but there must
be shortcomings in their training because they smuggle in some Cuban pitchers
--who, would rank first, second or third-- or a shortstop, or a third base.
These get there and the pitcher strikes out their best batters and the
shortstop does not let a ball go past him. (APPLAUSE AND EXCLAMATIONS)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We would be practically rich if we auctioned Cuban
baseball players. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) They no longer want to pay American
baseball players because those are too expensive. They have organized academies
in our countries to train players at a very low cost and pay them lower
salaries, but still a salary of millions of dollars a year. Together with
this, all the TV advertising, plus automobiles from here to there (POINTS
OUT) and beautiful women from all ethnic groups linked to automobile advertising
(LAUGHTER) and the rest of the commercial advertising you see in some tabloids
can tempt more than one of our countrymen.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In Cuba we do not spend any newsprint or other resources
in such frivolous advertising. The very few times I watch American TV,
I can hardly stand it because every three minutes it stops for a commercial,
sometimes a man working out on an exercise bike which is the most boring
thing in the world... (APPLAUSE AND EXCLAMATIONS) I am not saying it is
wrong, I say it is boring. Any program, even soap operas are interrupted
in their sweetest moments of love... (LAUGHTER)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In Cuba we buy some soap operas from abroad because
we have not been able to cover our needs and some made in Latin American
countries are so attractive to the Cuban audience that they even cause
people to stop working. At times, we also get good films from Latin America
but practically everything circulating in the world is sheer Yankee-made,
canned culture.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Actually, what little paper we have in our country
is used for textbooks and for our few newspapers with few pages. We cannot
use resources to print those glossy magazines --I do not know what they
are called-- with many pictures, read by beggars in any street of our capitals,
advertising those fancy cars with their beautiful escorts and even a yacht
and other things, right? (LAUGHTER) That is how they poison people with
propaganda, so that beggars are also cruelly influenced and made to dream
of a Heaven -–unattainable for them-- offered by capitalism.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">As I said, in our country we operate differently.
Still, they have an influence with the image of a society that is not only
alienating, and economically unequal and unfair but also socially and environmentally
unsustainable.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I usually say as an example that if the consumer
pattern means that in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan o China there
may be an automobile in every household... I apologize to those present
who have one. Apparently there is no other choice, there are many avenues
and the distances are long here. I mean no criticism but a warning against
a model not applicable in a world that has yet to develop. (LAUGHTER) You
will surely understand me because Caracas cannot accommodate many more
cars. You know they are going to have to build avenues three or four stories
high. (LAUGHTER) I can imagine that if they were to do the same in China,
then the 100 million hectares of arable land would have to be transformed
into highways, gas stations and parking-lots leaving practically no space
to grow a single grain of rice.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The consumption pattern they are imposing on the
world is sheer madness, chaotic and absurd. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is not that I think the world should become a
monastery. (LAUGHTER) However, I do believe that the planet has no other
choice but to define which are going to be the consumption standards or
patterns, both attainable and obtainable, in which mankind should be educated.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Everyday, a lower number of people are reading books.
And why should human beings be deprived, for example, of the pleasure of
reading a book, or of many other satisfactions in the field of culture
and recreation, not only for the sake of acquiring material wealth but
also spiritual richness? I am not thinking about men and women working,
as in the times of [Frederick] Engels, for 14 or 15 hours a day. I am thinking
of men and women working 4 hours a day. If technology so allows it, then
why work 8 hours? It is only logical that, as productivity increases, less
physical and mental effort will be required; that there be less unemployment
and the people have more spare time. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Let us call a free man he who does not need to work
all week, Saturdays, Sundays or double shifts included, to make ends meet,
dashing at all hours in large cities, rushing to the subway or to take
a bus... Whom are they going to convince that that is a free man? (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If computers and automatic machines can work wonders
in terms of the generation of material goods and services, then why cannot
man benefit from the science that he created with his intelligence for
the well-being of humanity?</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Why must the person endure hunger, unemployment,
early death from curable diseases, ignorance, the lack of culture and all
sorts of human and social afflictions for exclusively commercial reasons
and profits? Why, for the sole interest of an over-privileged and powerful
elite operating under frenzied economic laws and institutions which are
not, were not, and will not be eternal?</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Such is the case of the well-known market laws. The
market has become today an object of idolatry, a sacred word pronounced
at all hours. Why should this be so when it is possible to generate all
the wealth required for meeting reasonable human needs compatible with
the preservation of nature and life on our planet? We must ponder and reach
our own conclusions. Obviously, it is reasonable for people to have food,
health, a roof, clothing and education. Also adequate, rational, sustainable
and secure transportation means; culture, recreation, a broad variety of
options and many more things that could be at the reach of human beings
and not, of course, a private jet or a yacht for each of the 9. 5 billion
who will live on the planet within 50 years.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They have impaired the human mind.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thank goodness that these things did not happen back
in the days of the Garden of Eden or of Noah's Arc in the Old Testament.
I can imagine that life was a bit more peaceful then. (LAUGHTER) Even if
they did have a flood, we are also the victims of floods, all too frequently.
Observe what happened recently in Central America. No one knows for sure
if as a result of all the climatic constraints we might end up buying tickets
or standing in line to board an arc. (LAUGHTER)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is the situation, they have instilled all this
in people’s minds. They have alienated millions and hundreds of millions
of people and made them suffer even more, as those people are unable to
meet their basic needs because they do not even have a doctor to see or
a school to attend.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I mentioned the anarchic, irrational and chaotic
formula imposed by neo-liberalism: the investment of hundreds of billions
without rhyme or reason; having tens of millions of workers manufacturing
the same things: television sets, computer parts, and clips or chips, whatever
they are called... (LAUGHTER) an endless number of gadgets, including a
large numbers of cars. Everyone is doing the same thing.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They have doubled the capacity for manufacturing
cars. Who will buy these cars? Buyers can be found in Africa, Latin America
and in many other parts of the world. Only that they do not have a dime
to buy cars nor gas, or to pay for the highways or repair shops, which
would ultimately ruin Third World countries even more by squandering the
resources needed for social development while further destroying the environment.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">By creating unsustainable consumer patterns in industrialized
countries and sowing impossible dreams throughout the rest of the world,
the developed capitalist system has caused great injury to mankind. It
has poisoned the atmosphere and depleted its enormous non-renewable natural
resources, which mankind will need in the future. Please, do not believe
that I am thinking of an idealistic, impossible, absurd world; I am merely
trying to imagine what a real world and a happier person could be like.
It would not be necessary to mention a commodity, it suffices to mention
a concept: inequality has made more than 80% of the people on the planet
unhappy, and this is no more than a concept. Concepts and ideas are required
that will make possible a viable world, a sustainable world and a better
world.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I find amusing the writings of many theoreticians
of neo-liberalism and neo-liberal globalization. Actually, I have little
time to go to the cinema, practically never, or to watch videos, however
good they may be. I rather amuse myself reading the articles these gentlemen
write. (LAUGHTER) I can see their analysts, their wisest and most perceptive
commentators, immersed in many a great contradiction, in confusion and
even despair; they want to square the circle. It must be awful for them.
(APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I recall that once they showed me a squared figure
with two lines on the top like this, one in the middle and another one
downwards. (HE POINTS) The object of the game was to draw over the lines
with a pencil without lifting it once. I do not know how much time I lost
attempting to do it instead of doing my homework or studying math, languages
or other subjects. In my childhood days there were no toys like those invented
by the industry to entertain children during school time so that they fail
their grades but we used to invent games ourselves in which we lost a lot
of time.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">But they amuse me and I truly enjoy them, at least,
I am grateful to them for that (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) but I am also thankful
for what they teach me. And do you know whose articles and analyses humor
me the most? Oh, the most conservatives, the ones who do not even want
to hear about the State, who want no mention of it, whatsoever. Those who
want a Central Bank on the Moon (LAUGHTER) so that no human being will
dare to lower or rise interest rates. It’s unbelievable!</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They are the ones who make me happiest because when
they say certain things, I ask myself: " Am I wrong? Could this article
not have been written by a left wing extremist, a radical?" (LAUGHTER)
But, what is this? After seeing [George] Soros write book after book and
the last one... yes, I had to read that one too. I had no alternative because
I reasoned: "Well, this man is a theoretician but he is also an academician
and, furthermore, he has I do not know exactly how many billion dollars
as a result of speculative operations. This man must know all about this,
all the mechanisms and the tricks. However, he entitled his book: <I>'Capitalism
Global Crisis</I>', which is quite something. There he states it with absolute
seriousness (LAUGHTER) and apparently with such a conviction that I said
to myself: "Goodness, it seems that I am not the only madman in this world!"
(LAUGHTER) Actually, many have expressed similar concerns. I pay more attention
to them than to the adversaries of the current World Economic Order.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The leftists want to prove that the system will inevitably
collapse. (LAUGHTER) This is only logical since it is their duty and, after
all, they are right. (LAUGHTER) However, the others do not want this to
happen. They become despondent and write many things when faced with a
crisis and all sorts of threats. They baffled. The least you can say is
that they have lost faith in their own doctrines.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Then, those of us who decided to resist in solitude...
I do not mean geographical solitude but almost complete solitude in the
field of ideas because in the aftermath of these disasters there is a skepticism,
which is then multiplied by the expert and powerful propaganda machinery
of the empire and its allies. All of this causes many people to feel pessimistic
and confused since they do not have all the necessary elements for analyzing
circumstances from a historical perspective, consequently, they lose hope.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Those first days were truly bitter, and even before
that, as we watched how many people, here and there, became turncoats --and
I am not criticizing anyone but the coats... (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) Then,
again, things change so quickly! Those illusions are now way behind --as
we say in Cuba, and I do not know if you also have this saying here-- they
lasted less than a candy bar at a schoolyard. (LAUGHTER)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They took to the former Soviet Union their neo-liberal
and market recipes, causing destruction, truly incredible destruction,
disintegrating nations. They brought about the economic and political dismantling
of federations of republics reducing life expectancy in some cases by 14
and 15 years, multiplying infant mortality by three to four times and generating
social and economic problems which not even a resurrected Dante would dare
to imagine.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is truly pathetic. Those of us who try to be as
well-informed as possible about everything that happens everywhere, and
we have no other choice but to be more or less well informed, more or less
profoundly, otherwise, we would be disoriented. We have what we think is
a quite clear notion of the disasters that the market god and its laws
and principles have caused. They, together with the recipes that the International
Monetary Fund and other neo-colonizing and re-colonizing institutions have
recommended and practically imposed on every country. Even wealthy countries
like the Europeans have found it necessary to unite and establish a currency
so that experts like Soros do not to bring down even the pound sterling.
That is a currency not so long ago reigned as a medium of exchange and
was the sword and the symbol of a dominating empire that was the master
of the world's reserve currency. All these privileges are now in the hands
of the United States while the British had to suffer the humiliation of
watching the fall of their pound sterling.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Such was the case of the Spanish <I>peseta</I>, the
French franc and the Italian lira; they staked their bets on the immense
power of their billions because these speculators are gamblers who play
with marked cards. They have all the information, the most prominent economists,
Nobel Prize laureates, such as the case of the famous company which was
one of the most prestigious in the United States, called the Long Term
Capital Management. You will have to excuse my "excellent " English pronunciation,
(LAUGHTER) but I prefer the title in Spanish, and practically everyone
knows it by its original name, which has been hispanicized. With a total
fund of almost 4.5 billion dollars, the company mobilized 120 billion for
speculative operations.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Company had two Nobel Prize Laureates on its
payroll together with the most experienced computer software producers.
And there you have it. The illustrious gentlemen made a mistake because
so many unusual things are happening that they did not foresee some of
them. For instance, the difference between treasury bonds at 30 and 29
years was larger than reasonably expected, immediately all the computers
and Nobel Prize laureates decided that they had to straddle. Apparently,
they had problems with the crisis that ensued, which they did not anticipate.
They thought that they had discovered the miracle of a ceaselessly growing
Capitalism, without crisis... We are fortunate that this did not occur
to them two or three thousand years ago! It was fortunate that it took
Columbus some years to discover this Hemisphere, (LAUGHTER) proving the
Earth was round. Also that other economic, social and scientific advances
were equally delayed since it was on them that such a system, inseparable
from its crises, took root, otherwise there would not be any human beings
left on this planet. Perhaps there would be nothing left.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Those from the Long-Term, as it is commonly known,
made a mistake and lost. It was a disaster and it was necessary to go to
their rescue, violating all international, ethical, moral and financial
norms that the United States had imposed on the world. The President of
the Federal Reserve declared in the Senate that if that fund was not bailed
out, there would inevitably be an economic catastrophe, both in the United
States and in the rest of the world.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Another question: What kind of economy is that prevailing
today where a handful of multi-millionaires can cause an economic catastrophe
in the United States and in the world? I do not mean the big ones, not
Bill Gates and others like him since Bill Gates' fortune is about fifteen
times the initial capital with which Long Term mobilized enormous sums
from savers, obtaining loans from over 50 banks. But, oh! The international
economy would have collapsed had it not been bailed out. And this was stated
by one of the most competent and intelligent persons in the United Sates,
the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">That distinguished gentleman knows more than a thing
or two. The problem is that he does not say everything he knows because
part of the method consists in a total lack of transparency and strong
doses of sedatives in case of panic accompanied by sweet and encouraging
words: "Everything is all right, the economy is running smoothly". This
is the accepted and always applied technique. However, the President of
the Federal Reserve had to admit before the US Senate that a catastrophe
would have occurred if the Fed had not done what it did.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">These are the bases of neo-liberal globalization.
Do not worry, you may subtract one or 20 more from their fragile structure.
What they have created is unsustainable! However, they have caused anguish
for many people throughout the world. They have ruined nations with the
International Monetary Fund's formula and continue to impoverish countries.
They cannot avoid the ruin of these countries, yet they do not cease to
do foolish things and in the stock markets they have inflated the prices
of shares and continue to do so ad infinitum.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the U.S. stock markets, more than one third of
the families’ savings and 50% of the pension funds have been invested in
shares. One can imagine the impact of a catastrophe similar to that of
1929, when only 5% of the population had their savings invested in the
stock market. Today, they would feel terrified and run in haste. That was
what they did in August after the crisis in Russia whose share of the world's
gross product is only 2%. That crisis made the Dow Jones, the key index
of the New York Stock Market, fall in one day by more than 500 points;
512 to be exact, causing an enormous commotion.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The truth is that the leaders of this dominating
system spend most of their time running around the world, from banks to
financial institutions. (LAUGHTER) And when they saw what occurred in Russia,
a track and field Olympics ensued. They met with the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York. Clinton delivered a speech, stating that recession
and not inflation was the real danger. In a matter of days, in practically
a few hours, they made a 180 degree shift and instead of increasing interest
rates what they actually did was to lower them. On October 5 and 6, all
the directors of central banks met in Washington. Speeches were delivered,
an undetermined number of criticisms were raised to the Monetary Fund and
the so-called measures were adopted to reduce the danger. A few days later
the US government met with the G-7, which decided to contribute 90 billion
dollars to stop the crisis from extending to Brazil and from there to the
rest of South America. They were trying to impede the flames from reaching
the over-inflated stock markets of the United States. A small pin, the
smallest of holes and the balloon would deflate. These are the risks threatening
neo-liberal globalization.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">That was what they did. Then some of us, myself included,
reflected on it and I said: "They have resources, they have the possibility
to maneuver and postpone the great crisis for a time". They could postpone
it but not ultimately avoid it. I reflected on the matter and said: "Apparently
they have succeeded thanks to all the measures adopted or imposed: lowering
interest rates; 90 billion dollars to support the Fund which had no funds;
(LAUGHTER) the steps taken by Japan to confront the bank crisis; Brazil’s
announcement of harsh economic measures and the timely statement that the
US economy had grown more than expected in the third quarter."</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It seemed that things would hold on. However, only
a few days ago, we were again surprised by the news from Brazil on the
current economic situation. This truly hurts us very much for reasons connected
to this very issue, that is, the effort that our peoples must make to join
forces and wage the hard struggle that awaits us. Actually, a destructive
crisis in Brazil would have an extremely negative impact on Latin America.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At present, despite everything they did, Brazilians
are faced with a complicated economic situation, regardless of the fact
that the United States and the international financial institutions used
up a large part of their recipes and ammunition. Now, after the first months
since the great scare, they are demanding new conditions and seem more
indifferent to the fate of Brazil.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">As for Russia, they intend to keep it on the brink
of an abyss. This is not a small country. It is the largest country in
the world with a 146 million population and thousands of nuclear weapons
where a social explosion, an internal conflict or any other event can cause
terrible damage.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Yet, these gentlemen who manage the world economy
are so insane and reckless that, after ruining a country with their recipes,
it does not even occur to them to use some of their own printed paper because
that is precisely what the Treasury bonds are, a refuge for terrified speculators.
When faced with any risk, speculators would buy United States Treasury
bonds. It does not occur to them to use some of the 90 billion designed
for the Fund in the prevention of an economic or political catastrophe
in Russia. What occurs to them is to impose a bunch of impossible conditions.
They demand that budgets, which are already below the indispensable limit,
be cut. They also demand free conversion and immediate payment of high
debts; a host of requirements that would deplete the remaining reserves
of any country. They refuse to think, they have not learned their lesson.
They intend to maintain that country in a precarious situation, at the
edge of the sword, with humanitarian assistance, imposing conditions and
generating truly serious dangers.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">However, the Russian issue has not been solved. A
country they impoverished, thanks to their advisors and formulas. Nor have
they solved the Brazilian issue, a problem they were so very much interested
in solving, since it could affect them very closely. Therefore it seemed
to me, for example, that this was the last stronghold of the United States
stock markets.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It was a close call. Some of the aforementioned measures
stabilized the situation a bit. Once again the sale and purchase of shares
was unleashed and once again they are off on a race to outer space, preparing
the conditions for an even greater crisis, and relatively soon. No one
knows what the consequences for the US economy and its society will be.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is impossible to imagine what would occur in the
event of another 1929. They believe they have done away with the risk of
a crisis like that of 1929, and actually they have solved nothing. They
have not even been able to prevent the Brazilian crisis consequently, they
may affect the whole integration process in South America, the whole integration
process in Latin America and the interests of all our countries. That was
why I said that recently we had received bad news.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">However, there is a cause for everything and an explanation,
and after waiting and watching how they think, what they say, what they
do one can actually guess what is hidden in their minds. The important
thing with those people is not so much to believe what they are saying
but, based on what they are saying, to penetrate their brains with the
least possible trauma as we would not want to harm them (LAUGHTER) to know
what they are actually thinking, to know what they have not said and why
they have not said it.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is how they behave. This is also why it is to
us a matter of profound interest, a source of reflection, encouragement
and reassertion of our convictions. Because we lived through the days of
uncertainty and bitterness that I previously described, and witnessed the
loss of faith of many progressive men and women. Now, we can see that the
truths are gaining ground and that many people are now beginning to think
more profoundly. And those who claimed the end of history and the final
victory of their anachronistic and selfish concepts are now in decline
and in undeniable demoralization.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">These past 8 years --since 1991, in other words,
from the collapse of the USSR to date-- have been hard years for us in
every sense, in this sense as well, in terms of ideas and conceptions.
Now we see that the high and mighty, those who thought they had created
a system or an empire that would last one thousand years are beginning
to realize that the bases of that system, of that empire, are falling apart.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">What is the legacy of this global capitalism or of
this neo-liberal capitalist globalization? Not only that capitalism that
we know from its very sources, that capitalism from which this one was
born which was progressive yesterday but reactionary and unsustainable
today. A process many of you, historians, and those who are not like the
students of economics must know. A history of 250 to 300 years, whose primary
theoretician, John Adams, whom you know well, published his book in 1776,
the same year of the Declaration of Independence of the United States.
He was a great talent, undoubtedly, a great intelligence. I do not think
he was a sinner, a culprit or a bandit. He studied the economic system
that emerged in Europe while it was in full bloom. He pondered, examined
and outlined the theoretical bases of capitalism. The capitalism of his
day, because John Adams could have never imagined this one.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">On those days of small workshops and factories, Adams
felt that the individual interest was the prime motivation of economic
activity and that its private and competitive quest constituted the basic
source of public welfare. It was not necessary to appeal to man’s humanity
but his love of himself.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Personal property and management were all that was
compatible with the small industries’ world that John Adams knew. He did
not even live to see the enormous factories and the impressive masses of
workers at the end of the 18th century. He could much less imagine the
gigantic corporations and modern transnational companies with millions
of shares and managed by professional executives who have nothing to do
with the ownership of these entities and whose main function it is to occasionally
report to the shareholders. They decide, however, which dividends are paid,
how much and where to invest. These forms of property, management and enjoyment
of the wealth produced have nothing to do with the world he lived in.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Nevertheless, the system continued to develop and
gained considerable momentum during the English Industrial Revolution.
The working class emerged and so did Karl Marx, who in my view, with all
due respect to those who may be of a different view, was the greatest economic
and political thinker of all times. No one learned more about the laws
and principles of the capitalist system than Marx. Presently, more than
a few members of the capitalist elite, anguished by the current crisis
are reading Marx, seeking a possible diagnosis and remedy for the evils
of today. Socialism, as the antithesis of capitalism, surfaced with Marx.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The struggle between those ideas symbolized by both
men of thought has persisted for many years and still continues. The original
capitalism continued to develop under the principles of its most prominent
theoretician until approximately World War I.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">From before the war, a certain level of globalization
existed. There was a gold standard for the international monetary system.
In 1929, there was the great crisis followed by the great recession that
lasted over 10 years. Then, another important thinker emerged, John Maynard
Keynes. He is one of the four pillars of economic thought that had an enormous
political impact on the last three centuries and the indelible seal of
each of his predecessors. Keynes was a man of advanced ideas for his time,
not like Karl Marx's although quite respectful of Marx and coincided with
him in certain concepts. He elaborated the formulas that extricated the
United States from the great depression.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Of course, he did not do it alone. A group of scholars
agreed with him and were under his influence. At that time, there were
practically no economists, nor were they taken very seriously. I do not
know if this was for better or for worse, it all depends... (LAUGHTER)
However, highly trained groups began to surge. They had plenty of statistical
information and conducted extensive studies and during the Roosevelt administration
in a country that was both exhausted and anguished by endless years of
recession; many of them became prominent cabinet members or other. Keynes's
theories helped pull capitalism out of the worst crisis it had ever known.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There was a temporary suspension of the gold standard
that was later re-established by Roosevelt in 1934, if I remember correctly.
I do know, however, that it was maintained until 1971. It must have lasted
37 consecutive years until Mr. Nixon came along and the great empire embezzled
us all. (LAUGHTER)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Perhaps you are rightly wondering why I am talking
about this. I have mentioned these characters, although I still have not
referred to the fourth one, because it is very important to know the history
of the system which currently rules the world; its anatomy, principles,
evolution and experiences, in order to understand that this creature, which
came into being almost three centuries ago, is reaching its final stage.
(APPLAUSE) It is convenient to know this, and it is almost time to perform
an autopsy on it before it finally dies, lest that many of us would die
with it, or if this takes too long, that all of us would die as well. (LAUGHTER
AND APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I mentioned the gold standard because it had a lot
to do with the problems that we are now confronting. Towards the end of
World War II, an attempt was made to establish an institution that would
regulate and step up world trade. The economic situation was in shambles
as a consequence of the long, destructive and bloody war. Therefore, the
well-known Bretton Woods Agreement was established by a number of countries,
including the most influential and the wealthiest.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The United States was already the richest nation
accumulating 80% of the world gold. A fixed exchange currency was established
based on gold, the gold-dollar standard so to say, because gold was combined
with the US bank note, which then became the international reserve currency.
This gave the United States a special privilege and an enormous power,
which it has continued to use in its own best interest. It gave that country
the power to manipulate the world economy, set rules, and prevail in the
International Monetary Fund where 85% of the votes are required to make
any decision. So with its 17.5%, the U.S. may obstruct any decision of
that institution. Thus, it controls and is practically the owner of the
Fund. It has the last say and has been able to impose worldwide the economic
order that we suffer today.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">However, Nixon cheated before that. Initially the
U.S. had 30 billion dollars in gold whose price was maintained through
a strict control of the market at 35 dollars the so-called troy ounce.
Soon, it began to incur in tax-free expenditures, tax-free wars. The United
States spent more than 500 billion dollars on the Vietnam adventure. By
then, they were running out of gold. They only had 10 billion dollars left
and, at that pace, they were going to lose it all. In a speech delivered
on 17 August 1971, I think, Nixon openly declared that he suspended the
US dollar conversion into gold.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">As I already explained, they were able to maintain
a fixed price for gold thanks to a strict control of the market, the aforementioned
35 dollars an ounce. If there were an excess gold supply in the market
they would buy, after all, it did not cost them anything. They would hand
over those bank notes and receive gold in exchange, thus avoiding a drop
in prices. If an excessive gold demand threatened to raise its price, they
would do the opposite. They would sell gold from their abundant reserves,
in order to lower its price. Many countries backed their currency with
gold reserves or with US bank notes. At least, there was a relatively stable
monetary system for trade.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">From the moment that Nixon, defrauding the whole
world and everyone who owned one of those bills announced that the value
of US dollar bills would no longer be received in physical gold he suspended
the most sacred commitment undertaken through an international treaty.
This is something he did unilaterally, by presidential decree or through
some other legal procedure, it was not even a House decision, and the world
had hundreds of billions of dollars in the central banks' reserves.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They kept the gold. Later, prices rose. The value
of the remaining gold, worth 10 billion dollars, rose to more than the
30 billion dollars they initially had in physical gold. They also kept
all privileges of the system, the value of their Treasury bonds and their
bank notes that continued to be the compulsory reserve currency in the
countries’ central banks. In order to get those dollars the countries had
to export all their goods, while the United States only had to pay the
printing costs. Consequently, the U.S. economic power became even greater,
and in exchange, it began to destabilize the world. How? The other currencies
suffered fluctuations. Their values changed from day to day. Money speculation
was unleashed; speculative sales and purchases of currencies amounting
today to colossal sums, based on the constant fluctuation of their values.
A new phenomenon had emerged, which is now beyond control.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Currency speculation which only 14 years ago involved
150 billion dollars a year now amounts to more than 1 trillion a day. I
would like to point out, so that we may understand each other in this Babel
Tower of figures and numbers which often give rise to confusions as well
as translation mistakes and misunderstandings, that I am not referring
to the term <B><I>bill&oacute;n</I></B> in Spanish, as there is much confusion
between the meaning of <B><I>billion</I></B> in English and <B><I>bill&oacute;n</I></B>
in Spanish. (LAUGHTER) The former equals one thousand million and the latter
one million million. This is what they call a "trillion" in the United
States. A new term has just begun to circulate, the <B><I>millardo</I></B>
which also represents one thousand million. I said, and I repeat, in order
to avoid any confusion, that the currency speculative operations reached
a figure of more than a million million dollars a day, that is, one trillion.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It has grown by two thousand times in 14 years as
a result of the measures adopted by the United States in 1971 which caused
the fluctuation of all the currencies, either within certain limits or
freely. Consequently, we now have this new capitalism, something which
would have never occurred to John Adams, not even in his worst nightmares
(LAUGHTER) when he wrote his book on the wealth of nations.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Other new and equally uncontrollable phenomena have
emerged --I already mentioned one-- the hedge funds. In fact, there are
hundreds or thousands of these. Think of what might be happening, and what
the repercussions might be, after the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve
declared that one of them might have caused an economic cataclysm in the
United States and the rest of the world. He is well informed. He should
know in detail what is truly happening.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">One can guess, judging by certain articles published
in a number of conservative magazines because they know. At times, they
need to print something that will support their arguments. However, they
try to be extremely discreet. But there are no longer so many foolish people
in the world (LAUGHTER) and it is not hard to discern what they did not
want to say. A phrase published in a very famous British magazine criticizing
the measures adopted by Greenspan in connection with the well-known hedge
fund said more or less that perhaps Greenspan had additional information.
I cannot exactly recall the phrase used which was more subtle.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">However, it is possible to discern from this magazine,
which is careful about what it prints and is a highly specialized journal
that it knew more than it was saying. And although it did not agree with
the decision of the Chairman of the Reserve, it knew perfectly well what
he meant when he ascertained that "It is necessary to save this Fund".
Undoubtedly, both the magazine and Greenspan knew why the latter felt that
there could be a chain of bankruptcies of the most important banks in strategic
centers.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The fourth personality who has definitely marked
the latest stage of capitalist economic development thinking is Milton
Friedman. He is the father of the strict supply-side economics applied
by many countries throughout the world and which the International Monetary
Fund advocates so strongly: the last recourse against the inflationary
phenomenon that surged with extraordinary strength after Keynes.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At present, we can find anything: a number of countries
immersed in a depression, others in inflation, recipes and measures that
destabilize governments. The world has already realized that the International
Monetary Fund will economically ruin and politically destabilize the countries
it assists or tries to assist. Now more than ever we can rightly say that
the assistance of the International Monetary Fund is like the Devil's kiss.
(APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Allow me to point out some facts which I would like
to draw to your attention and which respond to the question I asked myself
when I said: "What is the legacy of capitalism and neo-liberal globalization?"
After 300 years of capitalism, the world now has 800 million hungry people.
Now, at this very moment, there are 1 billion illiterates, 4 billion poor,
250 million children who work regularly and 130 million people that have
no access to education. There are 100 million homeless and 11 million children
under five years of age dying every year of malnutrition, poverty and preventable
or curable diseases.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There is a growing gap between the poor and the rich,
within countries and between countries; a callous and almost irreversible
destruction of nature; an accelerated squandering and depletion of important
non-renewable resources; pollution of the air and underground waters, rivers
and oceans; climatic changes with unpredictable but already perceptible
consequences. During the past century, more than 1 billion hectares of
virgin forests were devastated and a similar area has become either deserts
or wastelands.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thirty years ago hardly anyone discussed these issues;
now it is crucial for our specie. I do not wish to give any more figures.
I believe that these data serve to qualify a system which claims to be
perfect, to grant a rating of 100 points, 90, 80, 50, 25 or perhaps less
than 25. All this is very easy to demonstrate and its disastrous results
may be conceptualized as self-evident truths.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In face of all this, perhaps many are wondering,
"What is to be done?" Well, the Europeans have invented their own recipe.
They are uniting. They spoke about a single currency that has already been
approved and is now in the process of implementation. The good wishes of
the United States, according to spokespersons of that country, have not
been lacking, good wishes which are as great as they are hypocritical (LAUGHTER)
because everyone knows that what they really want is for the Euro to fail.
They say, "What a wonderful thing, the Euro is very good, it is an excellent
idea". This is the case of a rich, developed Europe with an annual G.D.P.
per capita of 20 000 USD in some countries and of 25 000 to 30000 USD in
others. Compare these countries with others in our world with 500, 600
or 1000 USD.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">And what shall we do? This is a question that we
must all ask ourselves within this context, at a moment when they are trying
to swallow our countries. And you can rest assure that this is what they
would like to do. We should not expect another miracle like that when the
prophet was delivered from the gut of a whale (LAUGHTER) because if that
whale would swallowed us, we are really going to be fully digested at full
speed.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Yes, this is our hemisphere and I am here speaking
from no other place than Venezuela, Bolivar’s glorious homeland, (APPLAUSE)
where he dreamed, where he conceived the unity of our nations and worked
for its attainment at a time when it took three months to travel from Caracas
to Lima on horseback and when there were no cellular phones, nor airplanes,
nor highways, nor computers, nor anything of the sort. And yet, he realized
and foresaw the danger that those few, recently independent colonies, far
up North, could pose. He was prophetic when he said, "The United States
seem destined by Providence to plague the Americas with misery in the name
of liberty". He launched the idea of our peoples’ unity and struggled for
it until his death. If it was a dream then, today it is a vital necessity.
(APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">How can solutions be worked out? They are difficult,
very difficult. As I said, the Europeans have set a target and are immersed
in a tight competition with our neighbor of the North; this is obvious,
a strong and growing competition. The United States does not want anyone
to interfere with its interests in what it considers to be its hemisphere.
It wants everything absolutely for itself. On the other hand, China in
the Far East, is a huge nation and Japan is a powerful, industrial country.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I believe that globalization is an irreversible process
and that the problem is not globalization <I>per se</I>, but rather the
type of globalization. This is why it seems to me that for this difficult
and tough undertaking, for which the peoples do not have much time, the
Latin Americans are the ones who should hurry the most and struggle for
unity, agreements and regional integration not only within Latin America
but also between Latin America and the Caribbean. (APPLAUSE) There we have
our English speaking sister nations of the Caribbean, the CARICOM members,
who after barely a few years of independence have acted with impressive
dignity.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I say this based on their behavior towards Cuba.
When everybody in Latin America, except for Mexico, severed all ties with
our country in response to American pressures, the Caribbean nations, together
with Torrijos, were the first to break through. They have struggled to
break Cuba’s isolation until the present when Cuba maintains relations
with the immense majority of the Latin American and Caribbean countries.
(APPLAUSE) We know them and we appreciate them. They cannot be left to
their own fate, they cannot be left in the hands of the WTO and its agreements.
They cannot be left at the mercy of the US banana transnational enterprises,
which try to take away the small preferences that they so badly need. You
cannot mend the world by leveling everything to the ground; that is the
way the Yankees do it, by razing everything.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Several of these countries live from their plantations
and produce only 1% of the banana marketed, 2% at the most, which is meaningless.
The United States government, to protect a US transnational that owns three
plantations in Central America, filed an appeal with the WTO and won. Now
the Caribbean nations are very worried because similar procedures may be
applied to take these preferences away and because measures are being adopted
to liquidate the Lome Convention, by virtue of which they enjoy some considerations
as former colonies and countries in dire need of resources for development.
It is unfair to take these considerations away from them.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is not fair to treat all nations equally, as there
are marked differences in their levels of development that cannot be ignored.
It is not right to use the same recipe for all. It is not right to impose
a single formula. Formulas for controlling and developing economic relations
are of no avail if they will only benefit the wealthy and the powerful.
Both the IMF and the WTO want everything <I>tabula rasa</I>.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The OECD, the exclusive club of the wealthy, was
rather secretly preparing a supranational multilateral investment agreement
to establish the laws that would govern foreign investment. Something like
a world wide Helms-Burton Law, and all that rather very quietly. They had
almost everything ready and then a non-governmental organization got hold
of a copy of the draft. The copy was disseminated through Internet creating
a scandal in France, which rejected such a draft agreement, apparently
they had not paid much attention to what was brewing at the OECD. Later,
I think the Australians did the same, consequently the draft was abandoned
which had been so secretly worked out.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is how many important and decisive international
treaties are produced. Then, they put the draft on the table so that those
who want to sign it may do so and those who do not, well, everyone knows
what happens to those who do not want to sign. (LAUGHTER) Not a single
word was discussed with the countries that were to apply such unavoidable
standards. This is how they treat us. This is how they handle the most
vital interests of our peoples.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They will continue. We must be very vigilant and
alert with these institutions. We must say that they were laying a big
trap for us. So far, we have managed to sidestep it but they will continue
with their scheming to make our living conditions even worse. It was not
only a matter of competing with everyone and with the whole world making
desperate concessions in every field. The Agreement on Multilateral Investments
was intended to facilitate their investments in the conditions they deem
fit, respecting the environment if they wish, or poisoning the rivers in
every country if they feel like it, destroying nature without anyone being
able to demand anything from them. But Third World countries are a majority
in the WTO and, if we can stop them from deceiving and dividing us, we
can fight for our interests. Cuba could not be excluded from the WTO because
it belonged to it since its foundation.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">But they do not want China in, at least they are
putting up great resistance. (LAUGHTER) China is making great efforts to
enter the WTO because a 1000 percent tariff can be applied to countries
not belonging to this institution and their exports can be completely blocked.
The richest countries are setting the rules and requirements that better
suit them.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">What is it that suits them? What is it they are after?
They want to see the day when there will be no tariffs, when their investments
will not be charged by the tax authorities in any country. They obtain
years of tax exemption as a concession from underdeveloped countries thirsty
for investments where they get the lion's share and the right to do as
they please with their investments in our countries with no restriction
whatsoever. They also impose the free circulation of capital and goods
throughout the world. Of course, the exception is that commodity bearing
the name of Third World people who are the modern slave, the cheap manpower
so abundant in our planet, flooding the free-trade zones in their own land
or sweeping streets, harvesting vegetables and doing the hardest and worst
paid jobs when legally or illegally admitted into the former metropolis
or into consumer societies.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is the type of global capitalism they want to
impose. Our countries full of free-trade zones would have no other income
but the meager salary of those fortunate enough to get a job, while a bunch
of billionaires accumulate fortunes, which no one knows how big they will
get.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The fact that an American citizen, no matter how
great his talent and expertise in technology and business matters, owns
a 64 billion dollar fortune, which is the annual income of more than 150
million human beings in the poorest countries, is something awesomely unequal
and unfair. That this capital has been accumulated over a few years, because
the stocks value of the large American enterprises doubles every three
or four years through stock exchange transactions inflating the value of
assets <I>ad infinitum</I>, shows a reality that cannot be considered rational,
sustainable or endurable. Someone is paying for all that: the world and
the astronomic figures of poor, hungry, ill, illiterate and exploited people
populating the Earth.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">What year 2000 are we going to celebrate and what
kind of a new century will we live in? Besides, this century does not end
on December 31st. People are self-deceived, because the last year in this
century is actually the year 2000 and not 1999. However, there will be
celebrations and I believe that some will be very happy to celebrate, in
a special way, on December 31, 1999, and on December 31, 2000, and those
who sell nougat, beverages, Christmas presents, Santa Clauses and all that
will do great business with two end-of-the-century days instead of one.
(LAUGHTER) France will sell more champagne than ever.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It’s all right with me. I spent this last Christmas
Eve writing a speech. It is better that way because you do not fall in
the temptation of broaching additional topics and issues and you strictly
follow what you have promised yourself. That was what I was doing at midnight,
this last Christmas Eve but I was happy. It was the eve of the fortieth
anniversary of a revolution they were not able to overcome. (PROLONGED
APPLAUSE) I was really happy, I cannot pretend otherwise.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The world will reach that 21st century with people
living under New York bridges, wrapped in papers, while others amass enormous
fortunes. There are many tycoons in that country but the number of those
living under bridges, at the entrance of buildings or in slums is incomparably
higher. In the United States millions live in critical poverty, something
in which the fanatic advocates of the economic order imposed upon humanity
cannot take pride.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A few days ago I was talking with an American delegation
visiting Cuba, actually well informed, friendly and outstanding religious
people and scientists, and they told me that they were engaged in building
a pediatric hospital in the Bronx. I asked them: "Is not there a pediatric
hospital in the Bronx?" And they answered: "No." "And how many children
are there in the Bronx?" I asked. And they said: "Four hundred thousand
children." So there are 400 000 children in a city such as New York, many
of them of Puerto Rican descent, of Hispanic descent in general, and Black,
who do not have a pediatric hospital.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">But they also said that, "There are 11 million American
children who do not have medical insurance." They are mostly Black, mixed,
natives or the children of Hispanic immigrants. Do not think discrimination
in that society is based only on the color of the skin, no, it is not.
Whether they have blond or dark hair, they are at times treated with contempt
simply because they are Latin American. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There was a time when I visited that country, then
I sat in cafeterias or lived in those motels at the side of the road and
more than once I felt their contempt; they almost felt furious to have
a Hispanic around. It impressed me as a society full of hatred.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The 11 million children without medical insurance
belong, most of them, to those minorities living in the United States.
They have the highest infant mortality rate. I asked them what was the
infant mortality rate in the Bronx and they said they thought it was about
20 or 21 per 1000 live births in the first year of life. There are worse
places --in Washington itself it is quite high-- and in areas where Hispanic
immigrants mostly live it is 30 or 30 odds. It is not the same everywhere.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Their infant mortality is higher than that of Cuba.
The blockaded country, the country targeted for their war and from which
they stole 3000 physicians, today has an infant mortality of 7.1 per every
1000 live births. (APPLAUSE) Our rates are better and they are very similar
throughout the country. It is 6 in some provinces, not precisely in the
capital; it may be 8 in others, but it is within that rank, two or three
percentage points of difference with the national average because medical
care reaches all social sectors and regions.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Even after the beginning of the special period, in
these eight terrible years, we were able to reduce infant mortality to
7.1 from 10 (APPLAUSE) in 1998. It was an almost 30 percent reduction and
that even when we entered a very difficult stage after the demise of the
socialist camp and especially the Soviet Union, with which we had most
of our trade. Also the US economic war against Cuba grew more severe. In
1993, for example, despite all our efforts, the per capita daily calories
intake had declined to 1863 from 3000 and to approximately 46 g of animal
or plant protein from 75 g. Oh, but among other essentials, a very inexpensive,
subsidized litter of milk was guaranteed to children under 7 years of age.
(APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We have managed to help the most vulnerable groups.
If there is a severe drought or any other natural disaster we try to find
resources wherever we can to protect everyone but specially the children
and the elderly.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The establishment of new very important scientific
centers has been one of the advances of the Revolution during the special
period. Our country produces 90 per cent of its medications, even though
some raw materials must be imported from very distant places. We have shortages
of medications, that is true, but everything possible has been done to
always have the most essential ones in stock, to have a central reserve,
in case some may be missing one day, and we are trying to have more reserves.
These actions had to be taken because we must anticipate in order to be
in capacity to protect those in greatest need. Of course, it is also possible
to receive medications sent by relatives abroad; we facilitate it as much
as possible, we do not charge anything at all, no tariff is paid for that,
but we do all we can for the state to offer these resources to all our
population.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Despite the said decline in food consumption, we
have been able to reduce infant mortality by 30 percent, as I said before.
We have also maintained and even raised life expectancy. On the other hand,
not a single school was closed; (APPLAUSE) not a single teacher lost his
job, on the contrary, teacher-training colleges and institutions are open
for all those who wish to enroll. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I must clarify that we have not been able to do the
same in all professions. In Medicine, we have already had to set certain
limits, looking for higher qualifications, for a higher quality in those
entering the profession because we graduated many physicians in our struggle
against our neighbor and we let them migrate if they wanted to. In that
battle we established 21 medical colleges. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Right now we are offering 1000 scholarships to Central
American students to be trained as physicians in our country (APPLAUSE)
and an additional 500 each year for ten years; we are establishing a Latin
American medical college. (APPLAUSE AND COMMENTS) With the cuts we have
made in expenses, even in defense expenses despite the dangers we face,
we will be able to locate the medical college in the former facilities
of an excellent school for civil and military navy captains and technicians
whose school has been moved to another facility. The medical college will
be ready in March and the first Central American students will arrive for
a six months premedical catch-course to refresh their knowledge and prevent
later dropouts. In September more than a thousand Central American students
will be studying their first year of Medicine in Cuba. (APPLAUSE) I do
not know if it is necessary to add that their studies will be absolutely
free of charge. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Perhaps I should say --and do not take it as an advertisement
for Cuba but as something having to do with the ideas about what can be
done with very little-- that we offered 2000 physicians to the Central
American countries hit by hurricane Mitch (APPLAUSE) and we have said that,
if a developed country or some developed countries --and some have already
answered --supply the medications, our medical personnel is ready to save
in Central America every year --I repeat, every year!-- as many lives as
were lost in the hurricane, supposing the hurricane caused no less that
30 000 casualties, as reported. Twenty-five thousand of those lives to
be saved would be children's.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">According to estimates medications to save a child
often cost only a few cents. What cannot be bought at any price is a trained
physician ready to work in the mountains, (APPLAUSE) in the remotest places,
in swampy areas, full of insects, snakes, mosquitoes and some diseases
that do not exist in our country. And none of them hesitate. The immense
majority of our physicians have volunteered for that task. They are ready
for it and 400 of them are now working in Central America; 250 physicians
are already working in Haiti, a country that receive the same offer after
it was hit by hurricane Georges.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The percentage of lives that can be saved in Haiti
is higher because infant mortality there is 130 or 132. It means that by
reducing it to 35 --and in our country we know very well how to do it--
100 children a year for every 1000 live births would be saved. That is
why the potential is larger. Its population is 7.5 million, and the birth
rate is very high, thus, physicians there may save more lives. In Central
America the average rate in the countries hit by the hurricane is about
50 or 60, almost half of the lives that can be potentially saved.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I warn you that these are conservative estimates.
There is a margin over and above the figures mentioned. On the other hand,
we do not want our physicians working in the cities because we do not want
any local physician to be affected in any way by the presence of the Cuban
physicians. Cuban physicians offer their services in the places where there
are no physicians and where other physicians would not go. On the contrary,
we want to have the best relations with local physicians, we want to cooperate
with them, whether they are in private practice or not. If they are interested
in a case, it is all right with us.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We have said that cooperation with local physicians
is necessary and also cooperation with other sectors. Our physicians are
not going there to preach political ideas; they are going to accomplish
a humane mission. That is their task. There should also be cooperation
with priests and pastors, since many of these have been carrying out their
work in isolated places. Some of our first physicians to arrive lived in
parish facilities.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">So they are working in coordination and we are very
pleased of it. They are working in intricate places, where there are indigenous
people who speak their own language, people with great dignity, and peasants
who live in small villages. That facilitates the physicians' work because
in Cuba peasants live far from each other in the mountains so they must
walk long distances to visit the patients regularly while in a village
they can visit more than once a day.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A program is being implemented there that says much
about what can be done with a minimum of material resources. What is most
important and those gentlemen, the managers of the financial institutions
I have mentioned do not know it, is that there is a capital worth much
more than all their millions: the human capital. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Perhaps, one day I meet one of those assistants to
Bill Gates, who is a computing champion, then I will ask him a question:
Can you tell me how many Americans have served abroad since the Peace Corps
was created? Just to know if they are more than the number of Cubans who
have done likewise thanks to the generous and cooperative spirit of that
very slandered and ignored island and people, against which a war that
was not waged against apartheid fascists is being waged. I am speaking
about an economic war. I know many decent, altruistic Americans. I know
many, and it is a very high merit that so many altruistic people live in
a place whose system only sows selfishness and the venom of individualism.
I respect these Americans. I have met some that have served with the Peace
Corps but I am sure that they have not been able to mobilize, since their
creation, the number Cuba has mobilized.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Once, when Nicaragua requested 1000 teachers --later
they asked for some more-- we invited volunteers and 30 000 offered. Then,
when the bandits organized and supplied by the United States who waged
that dirty war against the <I>Sandinistas</I> murdered some of our teachers
who were not in the cities, but in the most isolated places in the countryside,
sharing the peasants living conditions-- 100 000 volunteered to go. (APPLAUSE)
This is what I mean! And I must add that most of them were women because
women are the majority in that profession. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">That is why I am discussing idea; that is why I am
discussing consciousness. That is why I believe what I am saying, that
is why I believe in mankind. Because when so many of our fellow countrymen
and women went or were ready to go to those places, consciousness and the
idea of solidarity and internationalism proved to be a mass phenomenon.
(APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I will complete my idea. I already said that they
took half our physicians and more than half of the professors of the only
medical college in Cuba. We accepted the challenge --there is nothing like
a challenge-- and today Cuba has 64000 physicians, one for every 176 people,
(APPLAUSE) twice the number of physicians per capita in the most industrialized
of all the countries in the First World. And what I did not say is that
since the beginning of the special period we have incorporated 25 000 new
physicians in health institutions and communities throughout the country
in towns, country, plains and mountains. This is really human capital!</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is much easier to conquer a person than to buy
it. (APPLAUSE) Fortunately, it is much easier, because with its so-called
easing of the blockade --actually intended to deceive the world-- what
the U.S. administration is practically saying is that every American should
buy a Cuban. (LAUGHTER) I say: Well, let us raise the price then (LAUGHTER)
because there are 27 Americans for every Cuban. After all it has done against
our country, after intensifying its economic war under the pressure of
the extreme right, this administration had the ultimate idea: to buy us
one by one. (LAUGHTER) Not ministers, administrative cadre or political
leaders but common citizens, by granting every American a permission --always
with the Administration's prior consent, of course-- to send remittances
to Cubans even if they are not related.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I say: Very well, now we know we are worth something
(LAUGHTER) since there are people willing to pay for us, a very rich government
trying to buy us out. There are 4 billion poor in the world and they are
not willing to pay a dime for any of them. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) Our
quotation in the market has been climbing.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I am telling you this because we are extending our
medical care program to Suriname, which requested over 60 physicians. Even
from a region in Canada, an autonomous province, its authorities requested
physicians. They say: "We do not find physicians wanting to serve in the
Arctic Circle. They do not want to come." We immediately told them: "Yes,
but you discuss it with your government. It is up to you." Of course, conditions
would be different, not because we would profit from it but because it
is only logical for things to be different in case of an industrialized
country. The physicians' services would be reasonably although modestly
remunerated, since what moves us are not economic interests, but sincere
wishes for international cooperation in the field of health, in which we
have enough human resources.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If the Canadian official can overcome all the obstacles
to take the physicians there, we will have Cuban doctors from the Amazonian
jungle to the Arctic Circle. (APPLAUSE) But we are focused on the Third
World. We pay our physicians their modest salaries in our country. It is
good, we are all happy about that and our physicians are very happy with
this arrangement, their morale is very high and they come from a great
internationalist tradition.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We have received requests for cooperation from other
places. Thus, the idea emerged of helping Haiti and later Central America.
Now we see it is extending through Latin America and the Caribbean. We
have no money, but we have human capital. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You should not think I am boasting when I say that
they would have to bring together all the physicians in the United States
--I do not know how many they are-- to try to find 2000 volunteers ready
to go to the swamps, mountains and inhospitable places where our physicians
go. It would be worthwhile to see what would happen, even though I know
there are also altruistic physicians over there, that is for sure. But
to find 2000 willing to leave the standard of living a consumer society
offers and go to a swamp in Mosquito Coast, a place that not even the Spanish
conquerors could stand, and that is really saying something (LAUGHTER AND
APPLAUSE) that, perhaps, they may be unable to do. But Cuban physicians
are there: that is human capital. If we take one out of every three physicians,
we could offer the rest of Latin America the program we have offered Haiti
and Central America, in places where similar conditions exist, where children
and adults die for lack of medical care, in places no one else goes to.
We have made the offer and it seems it will be accepted and our country
will be in a position to respond. Such is the kind of human capital that
can be created!</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">How many lives can be saved? We have suggested and
publicly proclaimed the idea of having the countries in our region unite
to save a million lives every year, including the lives of hundreds of
thousands children. The cost of saving a million lives can be accurately
estimated and saving the lives of children is the least costly, because
older people need more laboratory tests and radiography, more medications
and all that while children survive almost by themselves after the first
year of life. At times a vaccine worth a few cents saves a life. Polio
is a case in point.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We believe that a million lives can be saved every
year with a small part of the money wasted in extravagant expenditures
and there are physicians ready for the task. There may be more than enough
medications in Europe but they will not save a million lives without the
15 000 to 20 000 physicians required to undertake a program such as this.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I am telling you about this so you know what Cuba
is today, why Cuba is like that and what the prevailing standards are in
Cuba, a country so miserably slandered in matters of human rights. A country
where in forty years of Revolution there has never been a missing person,
where there has never been a tortured person, (APPLAUSE) where there are
no death squads and no political assassinations and nothing like that has
ever happened. A country where there are no elderly people abandoned, no
children living in the streets, without schools or teachers, no people
left to their own lot.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We very well know what has happened in some of the
places where our neighbors from the North have been, such as those who
organized in 1954 the ousting of the government in one of the most important
countries in the Central American region. They brought in their advisers
with their handbooks on torture, repression and death. For many years there
were no prisoners, this category did not exist, only dead and missing persons.
A hundred thousand missing persons in just one country! And 50 thousand
killed. We could add what happened in many other countries with tortures,
murders, missing persons, repeated U.S. military interventions under any
pretext or no pretext at all.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They do not remember that, they do not speak about
that, they have lost their memory. In the light of the terrible experience
undergone by the peoples of our America, we challenge them. We will demonstrate
with actual facts, with realities, who has a humane sense of life, who
has true humanitarian feelings and who is capable of doing something for
mankind that is not lies, slogans, misinformation, hypocrisy, deception
and all they have been doing in our region throughout this century. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I know you do not need me to clarify all this to
you but since I broached the subject I feel it is my duty to say so. It
is very often that one meets misinformed persons who believe at least some
of the tons of lies and slanders that have been cast against our country,
in an attempt to hit us, to weaken us, to isolate us, to divide us. They
have not been able to divide us and they won’t be able to! (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I have said all these things to you in the greatest
intimacy. I could not come now and speak to you as I did in 1959 about
organizing an expedition to solve a problem in a neighboring country. (LAUGHTER)
We very well know that today no country can solve its problems by itself.
That is a reality in this globalized world. We can say here: "Either we
are all saved or we all sink." (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mart&iacute; said: "Humanity is my homeland." This
is one of the most extraordinary things he said. That is how we have to
think: Humanity is homeland!</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I remember a case in Cuban history of a Spanish officer
who during the Ten Years War --the first war for the independence of Cuba--
when the Spanish government executed eight innocent medical students accused
of desecrating the tomb of a rightist Spanish extremist, broke his sword
in an imperishable gesture of indignation and protest and exclaimed: "Humanity
comes before one's motherland." (APPLAUSE) Of course, some parts of mankind
are closer from home. When we think of mankind, the first thing that comes
to our mind is our Latin American and Caribbean brothers and sisters, whom
we never forget. (APPLAUSE) Then, comes the rest of that humanity on our
planet. We will have to learn that concept, those principles contained
in Mart&iacute;'s words --not only learn them, but feel them and practice
them.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is the Latin American countries’ duty to unite
without losing a single minute; the Africans are trying to do it. In Southeast
Asia they have the ASEAN and are looking for other forms of economic integration.
Europe is doing it at a swift pace. That is, there will be sub-regional
and regional alliances in various parts of the world.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Bol&iacute;var dreamed of an extended regional federation
from Mexico to Argentina. As you well know, the gentlemen from the North
sabotaged the Amphictyonic Congress. They opposed Bol&iacute;var's idea
of sending an expedition commanded by Sucre to liberate the island of Cuba
and remove all risks of threat or counterattack by the fearful and tenacious
Spanish metropolis; so we were not forgotten in Venezuelan history. (APPLAUSE)
Now that we are free from the domination of a much stronger power, our
most sacred duty is to defend our freedom for the very interest and security
of our brothers and sisters in this hemisphere.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Obviously, we must work out various forms of cooperation
and integration, step by step, but with swift steps if we want to survive
as a regional entity with the same culture, the same language and so many
things in common. This is something that Europe does not have. I do not
know how an Italian understands an Austrian (LAUGHTER) or a Finn, how a
German speaks with a Belgian or a Portuguese. But they have been able to
create the European Union and they quickly advance towards a larger economic
integration and a total monetary union. Why can we not be capable of at
least considering this type of formulae? Why do we not encourage all the
unitary and integrationist trends in every country sharing our language,
our culture, our beliefs and the mixed blood running through the immense
majority of us? And, where there is no mixed blood in our veins, there
should be mixed blood in our souls. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Who were those who fought in the Ayacucho battle?
Men from the lowlands and from Caracas; Venezuelans from the West and the
East, Colombians, Peruvians and Ecuadorians who were together and that
is how they could do what they did. The unforgettable cooperation of Argentineans
and Chileans was also present. Our greatest sin is that we lost, after
almost 200 years.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Eleven years from now we will celebrate the 200th
anniversary of the proclamation of the Venezuelan independence and later,
in succession, that of the other countries. Almost two hundred years! What
have we done in those 200 years, divided, fragmented, Balkanized, submitted
as we have been? It is easier to control the seven dwarfs than to control
a boxer, even he is a lightweight. (LAUGHTER) They have wanted to keep
us as divided neighboring dwarfs so they can control us.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I was discussing the need for unity not only in South
America but in Central America and the Caribbean as well, and this is the
moment to state it given what is happening in Venezuela. They have tried
to divide us. The great power in the North wants FTAA and nothing more;
a Free Trade Agreement and fast-track --I believe fast-track means quick,
right? A quick step? Yes, I also recommend a fast-track for us, a fast-track
to unite. (APPLAUSE) The Latin American answer to the fast-track from the
North should be a fast-track from the Center and the South. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Brazil should have our support and encouragement.
We very well know that the United States does not like the existence of
MERCOSUR, for it is an important embryo of an alliance that may become
wider and grow. Some neighboring countries are not too far away from MERCOSUR.
We see it as a sub-regional alliance, as a step toward a regional alliance,
first of South America and then another step, as quick as possible, to
embrace the Caribbean and Central America.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We are considering the need to advance in the contacts,
the concept, the arrangements and the practical steps that may be taken
in that direction before we can afford to consider the creation of a common
currency. We believe that in that field the most we can do right now is
to elaborate ideas and concepts. Meanwhile, we need to avoid, at all cost,
the political and economic suicide of replacing our national currencies
with the American currency, no matter the difficulties and fluctuations
imposed by the present economic order. That would be tantamount to the
annexation of Latin America to the United States. We would not be considered
independent nations any more and we would be renouncing every possibility
of taking part in the structuring of the future world. Under the present
circumstances it is absolutely indispensable to unite, to come together
and to expand our forces.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The meeting of the Caribbean Basin states will he
held in the Dominican Republic on April. Later, almost immediately, there
will be a meeting with the European Union in Rio de Janeiro. We have some
common interests with the Europeans; they are interested in some of our
things and we are interested in some of theirs. Living under the slavery
of only one currency, as we are now, is a tragedy and we are happy that
with the euro, a rival to the Olympic champion, to the gold medal winner,
has come into being. (LAUGHTER)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The strengthening of the United Nations is another
necessity that cannot be deferred. The United Nations must be democratized.
The General Assembly, where all the member countries are represented, should
be granted the highest authority, as well as the functions and role befitting
it. The Security Council’s dictatorship must end together with the dictatorship
the United States exercises within that body. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If the veto power cannot be eliminated because those
who have the last word about such a reform are precisely those with the
power to veto it, we strongly demand that the privilege be at least shared.
The number of permanent members must be suitably increased from the five
they are now in compliance with the growth of the UN membership and the
great changes that have taken place in fifty years. The Third World, where
a great number of countries emerged as independent States after World War
II, should have the possibility to share equal prerogatives in that important
United Nations body. We have defended the idea of having two representatives
for Latin America and the Caribbean basin, two for Africa and two for the
underdeveloped regions in Asia, as a minimum. If two are not enough, the
figure could be risen to three, in one or more of the above mentioned regions.
We constitute the immense majority at the United Nations General Assembly
and cannot continue being ignored.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We would not oppose the admission of other industrialized
countries but we give absolute priority to the presence of permanent representatives
of Latin America and the Caribbean and the other above mentioned regions
in the Security Council, with the same prerogatives of its other permanent
members. (APPLAUSE) If it is not so, we will have three categories of members:
permanent members with veto power, permanent members without veto power
and non-permanent members. And there is still more of this madness. Aimed
at dividing and thus preserving the privileges of their present status,
at the same time it reduces the prerogatives of the potential new permanent
members, the United States has come up with the idea of rotating that condition
among two or more countries from the various regions; that is, to reduce
this vital reform to zero, to nothing, to simple salt and water.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There is another way to regulate the irritating veto
prerogative with an increase in the number of members needed to apply it,
that is, the General Assembly may be given the possibility of taking part
in the main decisions. Would not this be more democratic and fair?</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A battle must be waged there. All the Third World
countries should unite. We say that to Africans when we meet with them,
also to Asians, to the Caribbeans, to everyone in every international agency:
the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Countries Movement, the Lome meetings,
the Group of 77, everywhere. We are a large number of countries sharing
common interests, wishing to advance and develop; we are the overwhelming
majority in almost all international institutions and you may rest assured
that we are advancing in building an awareness about the fate reserved
to us. We must work, persuade, fight and persevere. We must never be discouraged.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Those in the North are constantly scheming to divide
us. I am going to give you four examples having to do with Latin America.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They do not like MERCOSUR that has already achieved
some measure of economic success even though it is but an embryo of the
great regional integration we hope for, and they do not want at all. What
is it they devise? Well, many things. First, they organize those hemispheric
meetings leaving out Cuba, a reaction to the first Ibero-American Summit
in Guadalajara.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They devise the idea of having only one Latin American
permanent member in the Security Council, to have several important members
of our region confronting each other. They immediately add the advisability
of rotating the position among Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, of course,
with no veto power. Then, they create the special category of strategic
ally for Argentina. That plants distrust and restlessness among important
fraternal neighbors that should closely unite and cooperate, particularly
now when MERCOSUR is advancing.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They invent the Machiavellian decision of releasing
the sale of sophisticated arms to countries in the region, which may unleash
a costly, destructive and fissiparous arms race among them. Why arms when
there is neither a Cold War nor the ghost of the Soviet Union or any other
foreign threat to security but that coming from the United States itself?
Can these arms contribute to the unity, cooperation, integration, progress
and peace among us? What do we need to open up our eyes and finally understand
the geo-strategic purposes of this policy?</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They have not been able to continue leaving our small
country out everywhere. We already take part in the Ibero-American Summits.
We are members of the Association of Caribbean States. We belong to the
Latin American Economic System and have been included in the Latin American
Integration Association. We maintain excellent relations with the Caribbean
Community (CARICOM). We will be present in the important Summit of the
European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean to be held in Rio de Janeiro.
We have been admitted as observers among the countries in the Lome Convention.
We are active members of the Group of 77 and hold an outstanding place
as founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement. We belong to the WTO and
are very present at the United Nations, which is a great forum and an institution
that, once democratized, may become a basic pillar for a fair and humane
globalization.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">What are we doing there? Talking, explaining, submitting
problems that we know touch a large part of mankind very dearly because
we are free to do it. There are brotherly countries in Africa, Asia, Latin
America and other places that would like to submit many things with much
energy but do not have the same possibilities Cuba has. Being already excluded
from all international financial institutions, blockaded and submitted
to an economic warfare, invulnerable to any retaliation of that type, strengthened
by forty years of hard long struggle which gives us an absolute liberty
to do anything, Cuba can speak up. They may be in crucial need of a credit
from the World Bank or from the Inter-American Bank or from another regional
bank, or of some negotiation with the International Monetary Fund, or of
an export credit, which is one of the many mechanisms used by the United
States to limit their possibilities of action. That is why quite often
Cuba has taken upon itself such task.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In spite of everything, there are people in our impoverished
world who are so courageous that, for example, at the United Nations, the
Cuban motion against the blockade received the support of 157 votes against
2. (APPLAUSE) We had spent seven years in this exercise. The first time
there were some 55 votes in favor and four or five against and all the
rest, abstentions or absences. Who could want to be at odds with the Yankees?
Because voting there is by show of hands. (LAUGHTER)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">But people lose fear and fear was gradually lost;
dignity may grow and it does. The following year, there were more than
sixty, then more than seventy, then over a hundred. Now, after we have
the support of almost 160 countries and only two are against, it can hardly
grow anymore. In the end, there will be no country supporting this inhuman,
cruel and unlimited action except the United States, unless a day comes
when the United States votes for us and supports the Cuban motion. (LAUGHTER
AND APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We are making progress, gaining ground. The peoples
know, intuitively or instinctively, that we are very often slandered. The
peoples have a great instinct! Besides, the peoples know them because they
are everywhere doing all sorts of things, abusing people and sowing selfishness
and hatred. People know them. Contempt is difficult to hide and the Third
World countries suffer under such arrogance and contempt.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The various US administrations with their blockade,
their constant harassment and their exclusions have given us the possibility
of fighting them in full and of being even joyful to be excluded in exchange
for the freedom to speak without compromise in any forum of the world where
there are so many fair causes to defend. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">For the reasons I have already explained we may have
some sympathies with other countries. As for them, who are the main stronghold
of reaction and injustice in our times, we can say the truth and always
the truth, with and without relations, with and without a blockade. They
should entertain no illusions that, if some day they lift the blockade,
Cuba will stop speaking as frankly and honestly as it has done for forty
years! (APPLAUSE AND COMMENTS) It is a historic duty.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I will finish in a minute, if you allow me. (VOICES:
"NO!") Remember I am a visitor here (LAUGHTER) and I am here before you,
before the university students. I am in this country that I sincerely admire
and deeply love. (APPLAUSE) I am not flattering you. I was always very
fond of history. The first thing I studied was precisely history because
when I began the first grade they immediately handed me a book on sacred
history where I learned some things I still remember. (LAUGHTER) Of course,
I learned about the history of the Arc, the Exodus, the battles and the
crossing of the Red Sea. At times, when I speak with some rabbi friends
and I ask them: "Tell me the truth, where did you turn"? (LAUGHTER) In
jest, because I really respect religions and I have considered it an elementary
duty to respect the beliefs of every individual.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At times I discuss even theological issues about
the world, the universe. When the Pope visited Cuba, I had the satisfaction
and the opportunity of meeting some very intelligent theologians whom I
bombed with every type of questions. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) I did not
dare ask any of them about dogma or matters of faith but I did ask other
types of questions about space, universe, the theories about its origin,
the possibilities of there being life on other planets and things that
can be very seriously dealt with. With seriousness and respect you can
talk about any topic, and based on that respect ask questions and at times
even make jokes.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Well, here I am and I was going to tell you that
I should say something about Venezuela, right? If you allow me to (APPLAUSE
AND EXCLAMATIONS OF: "YES!") You are going to say: "He came to Venezuela
and did not say anything about us." Let me warn you that this is not an
easy task, for the reasons I have already explained.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I began telling you that it is a country I love dearly.
This is when I began to tell you about my love for history, for universal
history, for the history of revolutions and wars, for the history of Cuba,
the history of Latin America, and especially for that of Venezuela. That
is why I identified myself so much with Bol&iacute;var's life and ideas.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Fate would have it that Venezuela should be the country
to fight the most for the independence of this hemisphere. (APPLAUSE) It
began here and you had a legendary precursor like Miranda, who even lead
a French army in campaign waging famous battles which, at a point in time,
during the French Revolution, prevented an invasion of French territory.
He had also fought in the United States for that country's independence.
I have a wide collection of books about Miranda's great life, although
I have not been able to read them all. The Venezuelans, therefore, had
Miranda, the forefather of Latin America's independence, and later Bol&iacute;var,
the Liberator, who was always for me the greatest among the greatest men
in history. (From the audience they shout: "FIDEL TOO!")</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Please, put me in the forty-thousandth place. I always
remember one of Mart&iacute;'s phrases deeply engraved in my mind: "All
the glory in the world can fit into a kernel of corn." Many great people
in history were concerned about glory and that is no reason to criticize
them. Perhaps it was the concept of time, the sense of history, the future,
the importance and survival of events in their lives what they took for
glory. This is natural and understandable. Bol&iacute;var liked to speak
about glory and he spoke very strongly about glory. He cannot be criticized;
a great aura of glory will forever be attached to his name.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mart&iacute;'s concept, which I entirely share, associates
glory to personal vanity and self-exaltation. The role of the individual
in important historic events has been very much debated and even admitted.
What I especially like about Mart&iacute;'s phrase is the idea of man's
insignificance as compared to the enormous significance and transcendence
of humanity and the immeasurable reach of universe, the reality that we
are really like a small speck of dust floating in space. However, that
reality does not diminish man's greatness a single bit. On the contrary,
it is enhanced when, like in Bol&iacute;var's case, he carried in his mind
a whole universe full of just ideas and noble sentiments. That is why I
admire Bol&iacute;var so much. That is why I consider his work so immense.
He does not belong to the stock of men who conquered territories and nations,
or founded empires that gave fame to others; he created nations, freed
territories and tore empires. He was also a brilliant soldier, a distinguished
thinker and prophet.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Today, we are trying to do what he wanted to do and
remains to be done. We are trying to unite our peoples so that tomorrow,
following the same train of unitary thought, the only one which corresponds
with our specie and our age, human beings will be able to know and live
in a united, brotherly, just and free world. That is what he wanted to
do with the white, black, native and mixed peoples of our America.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Here we are in this land for which we feel special
admiration, respect and love. When I came 40 years ago, I expressed it
with deep gratitude because nowhere else was I better received, with so
much affection and enthusiasm. The only thing I could be ashamed of is
that I was actually in kindergarten when that first meeting in this prestigious
university was held. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Having said this, I will now express, as briefly
as possible, the reflection I wanted to make about Venezuela. I am sure
not all of you will agree with it. The idea is to make and honest, calmed
and objective analysis.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Figures and data this visitor has tried to analyze
lead him to the conclusion that in this new dawn the people of Venezuela
will have to face courageously and intelligently serious difficulties arising
from the current economic situation.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Commodity exports according to Central Bank report:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1997: 23.4 billion dollars (services, which have
almost balanced expenditures and income, are not included here).</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1998: 17.32 billions. In other words, the value
of exports dropped by 6.080 million dollars in only one year.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Oil (the main export item) Prices: 1996: around 20
USD per barrel; 1997: 16.50 USD; 1998: around 9 USD.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The basic minerals: iron, aluminum, gold and by-products
like steel, have all, to a greater or lesser degree, significantly dropped
in price. Both items make up 77% of exports. I mean, oil and minerals.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Favorable balance of trade:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1996- 13.6 billion dollars</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1998- 3.4 billions</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Difference: 10.2 billions in just 2 years</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Balance of payment:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1996- 7 billions favorable to Venezuela</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1998- 3.42 billions unfavorable to the country</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Difference: more than 10 billions.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">International reserves available:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1997: 17.818 millions</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1998: 14.385 million dollars</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Net losses: approximately 3.5 billions in one year</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Foreign debt:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1998: 31.6 billions, not including the private
short-term financial debt. Almost 40% of the country's budget are spent
servicing the foreign debt.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Social situation according to different national
and international sources literally ratified yesterday by President Ch&aacute;vez:
(APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Unemployment, he said: Official figures report 11%
to 12%. Other figures indicate 20%.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Underemployment (which supposedly includes unemployment)
--the parenthetical expression is mine-- is around 50%.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Almost a million children in a <I>state of survival</I>
– his own terms.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Infant mortality is almost 28 per 1000 live births.
15% of those deaths are due to malnutrition.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Deficit in housing: 1.5 millions.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Only one in 5 children completes grammar school;
45% of adolescents do not attend secondary school.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you allow me, I will give you an example: 95%
of children of that age are in secondary school in Cuba. That is almost
as high as you can go. I say this because 45% children out of school are
really an impressive figure.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To these data given by the President in his tight
synthesis, we could add others taken from various, reliable sources.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">More than a million children are in the labor market;
over 2.3 millions, who are out of the school system, have no trade whatsoever.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the last ten years, more than a million Venezuelans
who belonged to the middle class "c" category --as you can see, there are
also categories within the middle class-fell to the category of poor and
destitute amounting today to 77% of the population. This is due to a drop
in incomes, unemployment and the effects of inflation. This means that
categories "c", "d" and "e" include today from the poor to the destitute.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This was occurring, as President Ch&aacute;vez said
with meaningful and bitter words, in Bol&iacute;var's original homeland,
the country in the Americas which is the richest in natural resources,
has almost one million square kilometers and a population of no more than
22 millions.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I am trying to meditate with you here.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I must say, first and foremost, that I am a friend
of Ch&aacute;vez's, (APPLAUSE) but no one asked me to address any special
issue. No official in his team, no Venezuelan politician or friend knew
absolutely anything about what I was going to talk about this afternoon
here, in such an important and strategic place as the Central University
of Venezuela. I am offering this reflections under my total and absolute
responsibility in the hope that they can be useful.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">What are we worried about? I seem to perceive at
this moment an exceptional situation in the history of Venezuela. I have
witness two unique moments: first that moment in January 1959, and forty
years later, I have seen the extraordinary volatility of the people on
February 2, 1999. I have seen a people reborn. A people such as I saw in
Plaza del Silencio (Silence Square) where I was a bit more silent than
I have been here... (LAUGHTER) I even had to reply to an excellent citizen
of Caracas, because in fulfilling my elementary duty as a visitor, I mentioned
a few personalities that were in the government, beginning with Admiral
Larraz&aacute;bal, and when I mentioned another important political personality
of the time, there was noise, protests, which, in turn, made me protest.
I complained because that really embarrassed me. I think I even blushed.
I told them: "I am not mentioning names here for you to boo." I expressed
my complaint to the multitude gathered there at Plaza del Silencio. Those
were unquestionably revolutionary masses.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It was once again very impressive to see the people
in such extraordinary high spirits although under different circumstances.
Back then, hopes had been left behind. I do not want to explain why; I
leave that to the historians. This time hope lies ahead. I see in these
hopes a true rebirth of Venezuela, or at least an exceptionally great opportunity
for Venezuela. I see it coming not only in the interest of the Venezuelans,
I also see it in the interest of Latin Americans. I see it as something
in the interest of other peoples in the world, as it advances --because
there is no other choice-- towards a universal globalization.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There is no way of escaping it, and there is no alternative.
So I am not trying to flatter you with my words. I rather remind you of
your duty, the duty of the nation, of the people, of all those who were
born after that visit, of the youngest, of the more mature, who really
have a great responsibility ahead of you. I think opportunities have often
been lost, but you would not be forgiven if you lose this one. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The person speaking to you here has had the privilege
and the opportunity of accumulating some political experience, of having
lived through a revolutionary process in a country where, as I have already
said, people did not even want to hear about socialism. And when I say
people, I mean the vast majority. That same majority supported the Revolution,
supported the leaders, supported the Rebel Army but there were ghosts they
were afraid of. What Pavlov did with his famous dogs, it is the same thing
the United States did with many of us and who knows with how many millions
of Latin Americans: create conditioned reflexes in us.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We have had to fight a lot against scarcity and poverty.
We have had to learn to do a lot with little. We had good and bad moments,
the former especially when we were able to establish trade agreements with
the socialist block and the Soviet Union and demanded fairer prices for
our export products. Because we observed how the prices of what they exported
rose while those of our products, in the course of a five-year trade agreement,
remained the same. Then, at the end of the five-year period, we had less
purchasing power. We proposed a sliding clause: when the prices of the
products that they exported to us rose, the prices of the products that
we exported to them also automatically rose. We resorted to diplomacy,
to the doctrine and the eloquence that revolutionaries in a country that
had to overcome so many obstacles must have.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Actually, the Soviets felt great sympathy for Cuba
and great admiration for our Revolution. It was very surprising for them
to see that after so many years a tiny country, right next to the United
States, would rebel against that mighty superpower. They had never contemplated
such possibility and they would have never advised it to anyone. Luckily
we never asked anybody for advise, (LAUGHTER) although we had already read
almost a whole library of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and other theoreticians.
We were convinced Marxists and socialists.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">With that fever and that blind passion that characterizes
young people, and sometimes old people too, (APPLAUSE) I assumed the basic
principles that I learned from those books and they helped me understand
the society where I lived. Until then it was for me an intricate entanglement
for which I could not find any convincing explanation. I must say that
the famous <I>Communist Manifesto</I>, which Marx and Engels took so long
to write --you can tell that its main author worked conscientiously, a
phrase he liked to use, and must have revised it more times than Balzac
revised each page of any of his novels-- impressed me tremendously because
for the first time in my life I realized a few truths that I had never
seen before.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Before that, I was a sort of utopian communist. I
began to draw my own conclusions and ended up being a utopian communist
while studying from an enormous book with some 900 mimeographed pages,
the first political economy course they taught us in Law School. It was
a political economy inspired in the ideas of capitalism but which mentioned
and analyzed very briefly the different schools and criteria. Later, in
the second course, I paid much attention to the subject and meditated on
the basis of rational viewpoints, so I ended up being a utopian communist.
I call it that because my doctrine had no scientific or historic basis
whatsoever. It was based on the good wishes of a student recently graduated
from a Jesuits’ school. And I am very grateful because they taught me some
things that have helped me in life, above all, to have strength, a certain
sense of honor and definite ethical principles that these Spanish Jesuits
although very distant from any of the ideas I uphold today instilled in
their pupils.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I came out of that school an athlete, an explorer
and a mountain climber. I entered the University of Havana ignorant about
politics, without a revolutionary private tutor who would have been so
useful to me at that stage of my life.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">That is how I came to have my own ideas, which I
preserve and maintain with growing loyalty and fervor. Maybe it is because
I now have a little more experience and knowledge, and maybe also because
I have had the opportunity of meditating about new problems that did not
even exist during Marx's time.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">For example, the word <I>environment</I> was probably
never pronounced by anyone in all of Karl Marx's life, except Malthus who
said that the population grew in geometric progression and that there would
not be enough food for so many people. He thus became a sort of forerunner
of today's ecologists, although he maintained ideas concerning the economy
and salaries we cannot but disagree with. (LAUGHTER)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">So I am wearing the same coat I wore when I came
to this university 40 years ago, (APPLAUSE) the same one I wore when I
attacked the Moncada garrison, when we disembarked from <I>Granma</I> (APPLAUSE).
I would venture to say, despite the many pages of adventure that anyone
can find in my revolutionary life, that I always tried to be wise and sensible,
although perhaps I have been wiser than sensible.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In our conception and development of the Cuban Revolution,
we acted as Mart&iacute; said when, on the eve of his death in combat,
he addressed the great anti-imperialist objective of his struggle: "It
had to be in silence and sort of indirectly since the achievement of certain
goals demands concealment for, if proclaimed for what they really are,
obstacles so formidable would rise as to prevent their attainment."</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I was discreet, but not as much as I should have
been because I would explain Marx's ideas and the class society to everyone
I met. So, in the people's movement whose slogan in its fight against corruption
was "Dignity against Money" which I had joined as soon as I arrived at
the university, they were beginning to take me for a communist. Towards
the end of my university studies, I was no longer a utopian communist but
rather an atypical communist who was acting freely. I based myself in a
realistic analysis of our country's situation.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Those were the times of McCarthyism and Cuba’s Marxist
Party, the People's Socialist Party was almost completely isolated. However,
within the movement I had joined, which had now become the Cuban People's
Party, a large mass, in my opinion, had a class instinct but lacked a class
consciousness: peasants, workers, professionals, middle-class people, good,
honest, potentially revolutionary people. Its founder and leader, a man
of great charisma, had dramatically taken his own life a few months before
the 1952 coup d'&eacute;tat. The younger ranks of that party later became
an important part of our movement.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I was a member of that political organization which,
as it usually happened, was already falling into the hands of rich people,
and I knew by heart what was going to happen after the then inevitable
electoral triumph. But I had come up with some ideas, also on my own --just
imagine the things a utopian can think up-- about what had to be done in
Cuba and how to do it, despite the United States. Those masses had to be
led along a revolutionary path. Maybe that was the merit of the tactic
we pursued. Of course, we were reading Marx's, Engels's and Lenin's books.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When we attacked the Moncada garrison we left one
of Lenin's books behind, and the first thing the propaganda of Batista's
regime said during the trial was that it was a conspiracy of corrupt members
of the recently overthrown government, bankrolled with their money, and
communist too. No one knows how both categories could be reconciled.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the trial, I assumed my own defense. It was not
that I thought myself a good lawyer but I thought that I was the person
who could best defend myself at that moment. I put on a gown and took my
place with the lawyers. It was a political and not a penal trial. I did
not intend to be acquitted but to disseminate ideas. I began to cross-examine
all those killers who had murdered dozens upon dozens of our comrades and
were there as witnesses; I turned the trial against them. (APPLAUSE) So
the next day they took me out of there, they put me away and declared me
ill. (LAUGHTER)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">That was the last thing they did although they really
wanted to do away with me once and for all; but, well, I knew very well
why they checked themselves. I knew and I know the psychology of all of
those people. It was due to the mood and the situation with the people,
the rejection and huge indignation caused by all the murders they had committed.
I also had a bit of luck. But the fact is that at the beginning, while
they were questioning me, this book of Lenin appears. Someone takes it
out and says: "You people had a book of Lenin."</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We were explaining who we were: Mart&iacute; followers,
that was the truth, that we had nothing to do with that corrupt government
that they had ousted from power, that our objectives were such and such.
However, we did not say a word about Marxism-Leninism, neither did we have
to. We said what we had to say but since the subject of the book came up
at the trial, I felt really irritated and said: "Yes, that book by Lenin
is ours, we read Lenin's books and other socialist books, and whoever does
not read them is an ignorant." That is what I told the judges and the rest
of the people there. (APPLAUSE) That was insufferable. We were not going
to say: "Listen, that little book was planted there by somebody..." (LAUGHTER)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Our program had been presented when I defended myself
at the trial, therefore, those who did not know how we thought was because
they did not want to know. Perhaps they tried to ignore that speech known
as <I>History Will Absolve Me </I>with which I defended myself all alone
over there. Because, as I have explained, I was expelled, they declared
me ill, they tried all the others and sent me to a hospital to try me,
in a small ward. They did not exactly hospitalize me but put me in an isolated
prison cell. In the hospital, they turned a small ward into a courtroom
with the judges and a few other people crammed into it, most of them from
the military. They tried me there, and I had the pleasure of saying there
all that I thought, everything, quite defiantly.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I wonder why they were not able to deduce what our
political thought was, for it was all there. It contained you might say
the foundation of a socialist government program although we were convinced
the time was not ripe, that the right time and stages would come. That
was when we spoke about the land reform among many other things of a social
and economic nature. We said that all the profits obtained by all those
gentlemen with so much money --that is, the surplus value but without using
such terminology-- (LAUGHTER) should be used for the development of the
country, and I hinted that it was the government's responsibility to look
after the development of the country and that surplus money.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I even spoke about the golden calf. I recalled the
Bible once again and singled out "those who worshipped the golden calf",
in a clear reference to those who expected everything from capitalism.
Those were elements enough for them to deduce our way of thinking.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Later, I have meditated that it is likely that many
of those who could be affected by a true revolution did not believe us
at all, because in the 57 years of Yankee neocolonialism, many a progressive
or revolutionary program had been proclaimed. The ruling classes never
believed our program to be possible or permissible by the United States.
They did not pay much attention to it. They heeded it and even found it
funny. At the end of the day, all the programs used to be abandoned and
people would become corrupt. So they probably said: "Yes, the illusions
of these romantic young men are very pretty, very nice, but, why worry
about that?"</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">They did not like Batista. They admired the frontal
fight against his abusive and corrupt regime and they possibly underestimated
the thoughts contained in that declaration, which were the basis of what
we later did and of what we think today. The difference is that many years
of experience have further enriched our knowledge and perceptions about
all those problems. So, as I have said, that is the way I have thought
since then.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We have undergone the tough experience of a long
revolutionary period, especially during the last ten years, confronting
extremely powerful forces under very difficult circumstances. Well, I will
tell you the truth: we achieved what seemed impossible. I would venture
to say that near miracles were performed. Of course, the laws were passed
exactly as they had been promised always with United States angry and arrogant
opposition. It had had great influence in our country, so it made itself
felt and the process became increasingly radicalized with each blow and
aggression we suffered.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thus began the long struggle we have waged until
today. The forces in our country polarized. Fortunately, the vast majority
was in favor of the Revolution and a minority, around 10% or less, was
against it. So there has always been a great consensus and a great support
for all that process until today. One knows what to worry about, because
we made a great effort to overcome the prejudices that existed, to convey
ideas, to build a consciousness and it was not an easy work.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I remember the first time I spoke about racial discrimination.
I had to go on television about three times. I was surprised at how deeply
rooted, more than we had supposed, had become the prejudices brought to
us by our northern neighbors: that certain clubs were for white people
only and the rest could not go there, as well as certain beaches. Almost
all the beaches, especially in the capital, were exclusively for whites.
There were even segregated parks and promenades, where according to the
color of your skin you had to walk in one direction or another. What we
did was to open all the beaches for all of the people and from the very
first days we prohibited discrimination in all places of recreation, parks
and promenades. That humiliating injustice was incompatible with the Revolution.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">One day I spoke and I explained these things. There
was such reaction, such rumors and so many lies! They said we were going
to force white men into marrying black women and white women into marrying
black men. Well, just like that other preposterous invention that we were
going to deprive families of the parental custody of their children. I
once again had to go on television on the subject of discrimination to
reply to all those rumors and machinations and explain the matter once
again. That phenomenon, which was nothing but an imposed racist culture,
a humiliating, cruel prejudice was very hard to eradicate.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In other words, during those years, we devoted a
great deal of our time to two things: defending ourselves from expeditions,
threats of foreign aggression, dirty war, assassination attempts, sabotages,
etc. and building consciousness. There was a moment when there were armed
mercenary bands in every province of our country, promoted and supplied
by the United States. But we confronted them immediately, we gave them
no time. They had not the slightest chance to prosper because our own experience
in irregular warfare was very recent and we were practically one of the
few revolutionary countries which totally defeated these bands despite
the logistic support they received from abroad. We had to devote a lot
of our time to that.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">One problem I see, one source of concern I have is
that many expectations have been raised in Venezuela by the extraordinary
results of the elections, and it is logical. What do I mean? I mean the
natural, logical tendency of the people to dream, to wish that a great
number of accumulated problems be solved in a matter of months. As an honest
friend of yours, in my own opinion, I think there are problems here that
will not be solved in months, or years. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">That is why I read the data. Because we are daily
looking at and analyzing similar data in our country: the price of nickel
or sugar; the yield of a hectare of sugar cane; if there is a drought,
if there is not; how much income we are getting; how much we owe; what
must be purchased urgently; what the prices of powdered milk, cereals,
indispensable medicines, inputs for production and all the other things
are and what it is to be done.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At a given point in time our sugar production was
boosted, almost doubled. There were good prices, we purchased machinery
and began to build the infrastructure. Investments in industry and agriculture
increased, limited only by Soviet technological resources, which were more
advanced in some fields and less advanced in others. They generally consumed
too much fuel.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">But we bought all the steel we needed that was not
covered by our national production. Half a million cubic meters of timber
arrived in Cuba from Siberia every year, purchased with sugar, nickel and
other products that, thanks to the sliding prices --the agreement we had
reached before the oil prices surge-- increased their prices as the price
of oil increased. (APPLAUSE) And do you know how much we got to consume?
Thirteen million tons a year. Not only due to all the transportation services,
the mechanization of agriculture and port facilities, the construction
of tens of thousands of kilometers of highway, hundreds of big and small
dams, mainly for agriculture, houses, dairy farms, all equipped with milking
machines, thousands of schools and other social facilities but also because
of the power consumption in industries and homes. The electrification of
the country benefited 95% of the population. There were resources but I
could add that we were not even able to manage them with maximum efficiency.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now we do, we have learned. In times of abundance,
you do not learn much, but in times of scarcity, real scarcity, you learn
quite a lot. But we did all those things that allowed us to achieve these
results in the economic, social and other spheres I have talked about.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Our country also holds first place in education,
in teachers per capita. Recently, UNESCO issued a very rewarding report.
A survey was conducted among 54,000 children in the third and fourth grade
of grammar school about their knowledge of mathematics and language, in
14 Latin American countries, among the most advanced. An average was obtained:
some were above the average and others were below but Cuba ranked first
by a wide margin, almost twice the average of the rest of Latin America.
(APPLAUSE) In all the parameters, such as students' age per grade, retention
rate, non-repeating students and other factors which measure the quality
of grammar school, we hold, without exception, the place of honor, placing
our country, all by itself, in category 1.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There are a large number of new teachers and every
passing year they accumulate more knowledge and experience, just like there
is a large number of doctors who gather more and more knowledge with each
passing year. The same thing happens with professionals in general and
several fields in particular. The percentage of the gross income that we
invest in science is incomparably higher than that of the most advanced
countries in Latin America, with tens of thousands of scientific workers,
many of them with postgraduate degrees and constantly raising their knowledge.
We have done a lot of things and invested mainly in human capital.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">What do I fear? It is this, which I frankly say here
and I am willing to say anywhere. You people lived through periods of abundance
(THEY TELL HIM THAT VERY LONG AGO) okay, long ago. In 1972 the price of
oil was 1.90 USD a barrel. For example, at the triumph of the Revolution,
Cuba could buy the 4 million tons of fuel it consumed with a few hundred
thousand tons of sugar, at the normal world sugar price existing then.
When the price of fuel suddenly rose we were saved by the already mentioned
sliding price. But when the crisis came --after the USSR was lost and our
basic market with it, as well as all our agreed prices-- we had to cut
by half the 13 million tons of oil which was our consumption by then. A
large part of what we were exporting we had to invest in fuel, and we learned
to save.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I have already talked about baseball players. I would
add that in every small village there were baseball players and they would
use tractors and wagons to transport the players and fans to the games.
And there were even some tractor drivers who used them to go visit their
sweethearts. (LAUGHTER) We had gone from 5,000 tractors to 80,000.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The people owned everything. We had changed the system
but we had not learned much about management and control. We also made
some idealistic mistakes. But we had a lot more things to distribute than
what we have today. Some said that Cuba had "socialized poverty." We answered,
"Yes, it is better to socialize poverty than to distribute the scarce wealth
there is among a small minority that takes everything and leaves nothing
for the rest of the people."</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now more than ever, we are forced to distribute what
we have as equitably as possible. However, there are now some privileges
in our country. The reasons were inevitable for us: family remittances,
tourism, opening to foreign investment in certain branches of the economy,
something which has made our work in the political and ideological field
more difficult, because the power of money is great; it must not be underestimated.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We have had to struggle a lot against all that. On
the other hand, we had reached the conclusion that living in a glass case
might be very pure but those who live that way, in total aseptic conditions,
when they are out of them they may be finished off by a mosquito, an insect,
a bacteria, just like many of the bacteria, parasites and viruses that
the Spaniards brought over with them killed a great number of natives in
this hemisphere. They lacked immunity. We said, "We will learn to work
under difficult conditions because, at the end of the day, virtue flourishes
in the fight against vice". Thus, we have had to face many problems under
the present circumstances.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You had a period of huge incomes when the price of
oil rose from 1.90 USD a barrel in 1972; to 10.41 USD in 1974; to 13.03
USD in 1978; to 29.75 USD in 1979; until reaching the fabulous price of
39.69 USD in 1980. In the following years, from 1981 to 1985, the average
price per barrel was 30.10 USD, a true stream of income in convertible
currencies for this item. I know the story of what happened later, because
I have a lot of friends who are professionals and every time I saw them
I would ask about the situation, what was their salary then and what was
their real income 10 years later. I have witnessed how that income dwindled
year after year until today. I should not really make any other type of
analysis. I always asked the Venezuelans those questions thinking about
the country's situation.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">These are not times of abundance neither for Venezuela
nor for the world. I am fulfilling an honest duty, a friend's duty, a brother's
duty, by suggesting to you, who are a powerful intellectual vanguard, to
meditate profoundly about these topics. We want to express to you our concern
that this logical, natural and human hope, stemming from a sort of political
miracle that has taken place in Venezuela might, in a short term, turn
into disappointment and a weakening of such an extraordinary process. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I ask myself, I should and I do: What economic feats
or miracles may be expected immediately with the prices of Venezuelan export
commodities so low and oil at 9 USD a barrel? What with the lowest price
in the last 25 years, a dollar which has a lot less purchasing power now,
with a larger population, an enormous accumulation of social problems,
an international economic crisis and a neo-liberally globalized world?</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I cannot and should not say a word as to what we
would do under such circumstances. I cannot. I am here as a guest, not
as an adviser, an opinion giver or anything like that. I am simply meditating.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Allow me to say that I do not want to mention any
but there are some important countries whose situation is worse than yours,
which I hope can overcome their difficulties.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Your situation is difficult, but not catastrophic.
That would be our perception if we were in your place. I will tell you
more with the same frankness. You cannot do what we did in 1959. You will
have to be more patient than we were, and I am referring to that part of
the people who want radical economic and social changes in the country.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If the Cuban Revolution had triumphed in a moment
such as this, it would not have been able to sustain itself, I mean that
same Cuban Revolution which has done all it has done. It emerged --and
not because it was so calculated, but by a rare historic coincidence--
14 years after the Second World War, in a bipolar world. We did not know
a single Soviet citizen, nor did we ever receive a single bullet from the
Soviets to carry out our struggle and our Revolution. Neither did we let
ourselves to be guided by any type of political advice after the triumph,
nor did anybody ever attempt it because we were very reluctant to that.
We, Latin Americans in particular, do not like to be told what to do.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At that moment, of course, there was another powerful
pole and so we anchored ourselves to that pole, which had come out of a
great social revolution. It helped us to face the monster that cut off
its oil and other vital supplies and reduced its imports of Cuban sugar
bringing them down to zero as soon as we enforced a land reform law. Therefore,
from one minute to the next, we were deprived of a market that had taken
more than a century to build.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Soviets, on the other hand, sold us oil. At world
price, yes; to be paid in sugar, yes; at the world price of sugar, yes,
but we exported our sugar to the USSR and we received oil, raw materials,
food, and many other things. It gave us time to build a consciousness;
it gave us time to sow ideas; it gave us time to create a new political
culture. (APPLAUSE) It gave us time! Enough time to build the strength
that enabled us later to resist the most incredibly hard times.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">All the internationalism that we have practiced,
which has already been mentioned, also made us stronger.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I do not think any country has endured more difficult
circumstances. I am not at all boastful if I tell you, objectively, that
no country in the world could have resisted. There might be some. If I
think of the Vietnamese, I think the Vietnamese capable of any kind of
resistance. (APPLAUSE) I think of the Chinese were equally capable of performing
any kind of feat.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There are people with peculiar characteristics and
conditions, deeply rooted cultures all their own, inherited from age-old
ancestors, which give them enormous capacity for resistance. In the case
of Cuba, it was a culture largely inherited from a world that became our
enemy. We were completely surrounded by hostile regimes, hostile campaigns,
a blockade and all sorts of economic pressures, which made our revolutionary
tasks extremely difficult. We spent six years in war against the bandits
employed by our powerful neighbor to implement its dirty war tactics. Also,
many years fighting terrorists, assassination attempts... what else can
I say, if not that it is a great privilege for me, after 20 years, to return
to this place, so dear and unforgettable to me already. (APPLAUSE) This
is evidence of the inefficiency and failure of those who so often tried
to accelerate the natural and inevitable process of life toward the end.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now we can say the same thing a lieutenant said who
took me prisoner in a forest near Santiago de Cuba in the early hours of
dawn several days after the attack against the Moncada army garrison. We
had made a mistake, there is always a mistake. We were tired of sleeping
on the ground, over roots and stones, so we fell asleep in a makeshift
hut covered with palm fronds. Then, we woke up with rifles pointed against
our chests. It was a lieutenant, a black man, with a group of unmistakably
bloodthirsty soldiers who did not know who we were. We had not been identified.
At first, they did not identify us. They asked us our names. I gave a false
name. Prudence, huh? (LAUGHTER) Shrewdness? (APPLAUSE) Perhaps it was intuition
or maybe instinct. I can assure you that I was not afraid because there
are moments in life when it is so, when you consider yourself as good as
dead, and then it is rather your honor, your pride, your dignity that reacts.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If I had given them my name, that would have been
it: tah, tah, tah! They would have done away with that small group immediately.
A few minutes later they found some weapons nearby. These had been left
behind by some comrades who were not in physical conditions to continue
the struggle. Some of them were wounded and we had all agreed they should
return to the city to turn themselves in to the judicial authorities. Only
three of us were stayed, only three armed comrades! And we were captured
the way I have just explained.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">But that lieutenant, what an incredible thing! I
have never told this story in detail publicly. This lieutenant was trying
to calm down the soldiers but he could hardly stop them anymore. When they
found the other comrades’ weapons while searching the surroundings, they
were infuriated. They had us tied up with their loaded rifles pointing
at us. But the lieutenant moved around calming them down and repeating
in a low voice: "You cannot kill ideas, you cannot kill ideas". What made
this man say that?</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">He was a middle-aged man. He had taken some university
courses and he had that idea in his head, and he felt the urge to express
it in a low voice, as if talking to himself: "You cannot kill ideas". Well,
when I look at this man and I see his attitude, in a critical moment when
he was hardly able to keep those angry soldiers from firing, I get up and
tell him: "Lieutenant", him alone, of course, "I am so and so, first in
command of the action. Seeing your chivalrous attitude, I cannot deceive
you, I want you to know who you have taken prisoner." And the man says,
"Do not tell anyone! Do not tell anyone!" (APPLAUSE) I applaud that man
because he saved my life three times in a few hours.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A few minutes later they were taking us with them
and the soldiers were still very irritated. They heard some shots not far
from there, got ready for combat and said to us, "Drop down to the ground."
I remained standing and I said, "I will not drop to the ground!" I thought
it was some kind of trick to eliminate us, and I said, "No." I also told
the lieutenant who kept insisting that we protected ourselves, "I am not
dropping to the ground, if they want to shoot let them shoot." Then he
says, listen to what he says, "You boys are very brave." What an incredible
reaction!</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I do not mean that he saved my life at that moment,
but he had that gesture. After we reached a road, he put us in a truck
and there was a major there who was very bloodthirsty. He had murdered
many of our comrades and wanted the prisoners handed over to him. The lieutenant
refused, said we were his prisoners and he would not hand them over. He
had me sitting in the front seat of the truck. The major wanted him to
take us to the Moncada but he did not hand us over to the major --there
he saved our lives for the second time-- nor did he take us to the Moncada.
He took us to the precinct, in the middle of the city, saving my life for
the third time. You see, and he was an officer of that army we were fighting
against. When the Revolution triumphed, we promoted him to captain and
he became aide to the first President of the country after the triumph.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">As that lieutenant said, ideas cannot be killed.
(APPLAUSE) Our ideas did not die, no one could kill them. And the ideas
we sowed and developed during those thirty odd years until 1991 more or
less, when the special period began, were what gave us the strength to
resist. Without those years we had to educate, sow ideas, build awareness,
instill feelings of solidarity and a generous internationalist spirit,
our people would not have had the strength to resist.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I am speaking of things that are somewhat related
to matters of political strategy. Very complicated things because they
can be interpreted in different ways, and I know very well what I want
to express. I have said that not even a Revolution like ours, which triumphed
with the support of over 90% of the population, a unanimous, enthusiastic
backing, great national unity, a tremendous political force, would have
been able to resist. We would not have been able to preserve the Revolution
under the current circumstances of the globalized world.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I do not advise anyone to stop fighting, one way
or another. There are many ways, and among them the action of the masses,
whose role and growing strength are always decisive.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Right now, we ourselves are involved in a great combat
of ideas, disseminating our ideas all over, that is our job. It would not
occur to us today to tell anyone: "Make a revolution like ours." Because
under the circumstances that we think we know quite well, we would not
be able to suggest: "Do what we did." Maybe if we were in those times we
would say: "Do what we did." But in those times the world was different
and the experience was different. Now we are more knowledgeable, more aware
of the problems and, of course, respect and concern for others should come
first and foremost.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At the time of the revolutionary movements in Central
America, when the situation had become very difficult because the unipolar
world already existed and not even the Nicaraguan revolution could stay
in power, and peace negotiations were begun, we were visited quite often
because of the long friendship relations existing with Cuba, and we were
asked our views. We would tell them: "Do not ask our views about that.
If we were in your place, we would know what to do, or we might be able
to think what we should do. But you cannot give opinions to others when
they are the ones who will have to apply opinions or criteria on matters
as vital as fighting until death or negotiating. That decision only the
revolutionaries of each country themselves can take. We will support whatever
decision you make."</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It was a unique experience, which I am telling in
public for the first time too. Everyone has his own options but no one
has the right to convey to others his own philosophy on facing life or
death. That is why I say that giving opinions is a very delicate matter.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This does not hold true for criteria, viewpoints
and opinions about global issues that affect the planet, recommendable
tactics and strategies of struggle. As citizens of the world and part of
the human race, we have the right to clearly express our thoughts to those
who want to hear, be they revolutionaries or not.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We learned a long time ago how our relations with
the progressive and revolutionary forces must be. Here, before you, I limit
myself to conveying ideas, reflections, concepts in keeping with our common
condition of Latin American patriots because, I repeat, I see a new hour
in Venezuela, an immovable and inseparable pillar of the history of our
America. One has the right to trust one's own experience or viewpoint.
Not because one is infallible or because one has not made mistakes but
because one has had the opportunity to take a 40 yearlong course in the
academy of the Revolution.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">That is why I have told you that you do not have
a catastrophic situation, but you do have a difficult economic situation
which entails risks for that opportunity that is looming.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There have been very impressive coincidences. This
situation in Venezuela has taken place at a critical moment in the integration
of Latin America; a special moment in which those further to the South,
in their endeavor for unity, need help from those in northern South America.
(APPLAUSE) In other words, they need your help. This has come at a moment
in which the Caribbean countries need you. It has come at a moment when
you can be the link, the bridge, the hinge whatever you want to call it,
or a steel bridge between the Caribbean, Central America and South America.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Nobody like you is in a position to struggle for
something so important and of so much priority at this difficult moment,
as unity and integration, we might say, for the survival not only of Venezuela
but of all the countries sharing our culture, our language and our race.
(APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Today more than ever we must be followers of Bol&iacute;var.
Now more than ever we must raise the banner with the concept that humanity
is our motherland, aware that we can only be saved if humanity is saved.
(APPLAUSE) We can only be free --and we are very far from being free--
if and when humanity is free. If and when we achieve a really fair world,
which is possible and probable, although from so much observing, meditating
and reading, I have reached the conclusion that humanity has very little
time left to achieve this.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is not only my opinion but the opinion of many
other people I know. We recently held a Congress with 1000 economists,
600 of them from different foreign countries, many eminent people, and
we discussed the papers presented. Fifty-five papers were discussed and
debated concerning these problems of the neo-liberal globalization, the
international economic crisis, things that are happening. Because I should
have added that, unfortunately, I am not much hopeful that the prices of
your commodities will increase in the next two or three years.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Our nickel has also declined by half its price. You
see, not so long ago it was 8000 USD a ton, and now it is 4000 USD. Two
days ago, sugar was six and a half cents, a price that does not even cover
production costs; the cost of fuel, spare parts, labor force, productive
inputs and so on. That is a social, and not only an economic problem. Hundreds
of thousands of workers live by the sugar mills and are very much attached
to them with deeply rooted traditions of sugar production, traditions that
have been transmitted from generation to generation. And we are not going
to close their factories although, right now, we are facing losses in sugar
production.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We have some resources. Tourism, developed mainly
with our own resources, has gained momentum in these years and we have
made several decisions that have proved effective. I am not going to explain
how we have managed to achieve what I have already explained. But I should
say that we did it avoiding shock policies, the famous therapies that have
been so insensitively applied elsewhere.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">What we applied were austerity measures consulted
with all the people. Before submitting such measures to Parliament, they
were submitted to the people and discussed with all the trade unions, the
workers and the peasants. We discussed what to do with the price of a given
item, what price to increase and why, what price not to increase and why.
That was also discussed with all the students in hundreds of thousands
of assemblies. Then the measures were submitted to the National Assembly
and later they were taken back to the grassroots again. Every decision
was previously discussed because nothing is implemented unless there is
a consensus and that is something that cannot be achieved by force.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The wise men in the North believe or pretend to believe
that the Cuban Revolution is forcibly sustained. They have not been clever
enough to realize that in our country, a country educated in high revolutionary
and humane concepts that would be absolutely impossible. (LAUGHTER AND
APPLAUSE) This is only achieved through consensus and nothing else; no
one in the world can make it if it is not with the people’s massive support
and cooperation. But consensus has its own rules. We learned to create
it, to maintain it and to defend it. A united people ready to fight and
win can be tremendously strong. Once there was a small disturbance that
was not essentially political. It was a moment when the United States was
encouraging through every means illegal exits to its territory. Cubans
received automatic residence rights, something the US does not grant to
citizens of any other country in the world. This was an encouragement for
anyone to make a raft stronger than the Kon-Tiki or to use a motor boat
to travel to that rich country assisted by the Gulf stream. Many people
have sport vessels. Others stole boats and were welcomed as heroes, with
all honors.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In an incident related to a plan to steal a passenger
boat in the port of Havana to create a migratory disorder there was some
turmoil and some began to throw stones against some store windows. What
did we do then? We have never used soldiers or policemen against civilians.
We have never had a fire engine throwing powerful jets of water against
people, as one can see in those images from Europe itself almost every
day, nor people wearing masks as if ready for a trip to outer space. (LAUGHTER
AND APPLAUSE) No, it is consensus that maintains and gives the Revolution
its force.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">That day I remember I was just getting to my office,
it was about midday and I heard the news. I called my escorts, who were
carrying weapons, and told them: "We are heading for the disturbances.
You are forbidden to use your weapons!" I really preferred to have someone
shoot at me than using weapons in this type of situation, that is why I
gave them categorical instructions and they dutifully went there with me.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">How long did the disturbances last? Minutes, seconds
perhaps. Most of the people were perched in their balconies. They were
somewhat shocked, surprised. Some underclass were throwing stones. And,
suddenly, I think even those who were throwing stones started to applaud
then the whole crowd moved and it was really impressive to see how the
people react when it becomes aware of something that might harm the Revolution!</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Well, I intended to get to the Havana City Museum
where the city historian was. "How might Leal be?" He was said to be besieged
in the Museum. But some blocks away, near the sea wall a whole crowd was
walking with us and there were no signs of violence. I had said: "Not one
unit should be moved, not one weapon, not one soldier." If you trust the
people and if you have the trust of that people, you do not have to use
weapons ever. We have never used them in our country. (APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">So what you need is unity, political culture and
the conscious and militant support of the people. We built that through
a long work. You, Venezuelans, will not be able to create it in a few days,
nor in a few months.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If instead of being an old friend, someone to whom
you have made the great honor of receiving with affection and trust, if
instead of being an old and modest friend --I say it candidly, since I
am totally convinced of it-- if it were one of the Venezuelan forefathers
who was here; I dare say more, if it were that great and talented man who
dreamed of the unity of Latin America who was here, talking to you right
now, he would say: "Save this process! Save this opportunity! (PROLONGED
APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I think you can be happy, and you will be happy,
with many of the things you can do. Many already are at hand reach and
depend on subjective factors and on very little resources. We have done
that but one cannot realistically think of abundant resources: with some
adding and subtracting it would be easy to understand. Yes, you can find
resources, and you can find them in many things to meet priority, fundamental,
essential requirements. But you cannot dream that the Venezuelan society
will now have the resources it once had, under very different circumstances.
The world is in crisis, prices for raw materials are very low, and the
enemy would try to make use of that.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rest assured that our neighbors on the North are
not at all happy with the process that is taking place in Venezuela, (APPLAUSE)
nor do they want it to succeed. (SOMEONE FROM THE AUDIENCE SAYS SOMETHING)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I am not here to sow discord, quite the opposite.
I would recommend wisdom and caution, all the necessary caution, and no
more than necessary. But you have to be skilled politicians. You will even
need to be skilled diplomats. You should avoid frightening many people.
Based on my own experience of many years, not on my own intelligence, I
suggest that you subtract as few people as possible. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A transformation, a change, a revolution in the sense
that word has today, when you look farther than the piece of land where
you were born, when you think of the world, when you think of mankind,
require the participation of the people. Better add than subtract. Look,
that lieutenant who commanded the platoon that took me prisoner was added
to our cause, not subtracted from it. (APPLAUSE) I took that man the way
he was, and I have met some like him in my life. I would say I have met
many like him.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is true that the social environment, the social
situation is the main factor in forging man’s conscience. After all, I
was the son of a landowner who had quite an extension of land in a country
the size of Cuba, perhaps not so in Venezuela. My father had about 1000
hectares of land of his own and 10000 hectares of leased land that he exploited.
He was born in Spain and as a young and poor peasant was enrolled to fight
against the Cubans.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Recently, in an important American magazine someone
trying to offend the Spaniards, annoyed because the Spaniards have increased
their investments in Latin America, published a very harsh article against
Spain. One could see from that article that they were really angry. They
want everything for themselves. They do not want a Spanish <I>peseta</I>
invested in these lands, let alone in Cuba, and among other things the
article said that in spite of his attacks against imperialism, Fidel Castro
admires the re-conquest. The article construed things as if it were a Spanish
re-conquest. It was entitled "In Search of the new El Dorado" and at one
point in its furious attack it added that the Cuban ruler, the son of a
Spanish soldier who fought on the wrong side during the war of independence,
does not criticize the re-conquest.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I think about my father, who perhaps was 16 or 17
when he was enrolled over there and sent to Cuba as things were done in
those days, and stationed in a Spanish fortified line. Could my father
be really accused of fighting on the wrong side? No. In any case, he fought
on the right side, he fought with the Spaniards. What do they want? That
he should be an expert on Marxism, internationalism and a host of other
things when he could barely read and write? (APPLAUSE) I thought that they
enlisted him and he fought on the right side. Those in the Yankee magazine
are wrong. If he had fought on the Cuban side he would have been on the
wrong side because this was not his country. He knew nothing about it.
He could not even understand what the Cubans were fighting for. He was
a conscript. He was brought here as they brought other hundreds of thousands
of people. When the war ended, he was repatriated to Spain and he came
back to Cuba a little after to work as a farmhand.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Later he became a landowner. I was born and I lived
in a large state and it did not do me any harm. There I had my first friends.
They were poor children of the place, the children of waged workers and
modest peasants, victims all of the capitalist system. Later I went to
schools that were more for the elite, but I came out unscathed, luckily.
I really mean luckily. I had the fortune of being the son, and not the
grandson of a landowner. If had I been the grandson of a landowner I would
have probably been born and brought up in a city, among rich children,
in a very high class neighborhood, and I would have never had my utopian
or Marxist communist ideas nor anything similar.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">No one is born a revolutionary, nor a poet or a warrior.
It is the circumstances that make an individual or give him the opportunity
of being one thing or the other.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If Columbus had been born a century before, no one
would have heard of him. Spain was still under Arab occupation. If he had
not been wrong and there had really been a path directly to China by sea
without an unforeseen continent in between, he would have lasted 15 minutes
on the coast of China. Remember that the Spaniards conquered Cuba with
just twelve horses and in those days the Mongols already had cavalries
with hundreds of thousands of soldiers. (APPLAUSE) See how things come
to be.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I will not say anything about Bol&iacute;var, because
he was born where he should, the day he should and in the way he should,
that’s it! (APPLAUSE) I leave aside the scenario of what would have happened
if he had been born a hundred years before or a hundred years later because
that was impossible. (LAUGHTER) (CRIES FROM THE AUDIENCE: "CHE!")</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Che? Che [Guevara] has been present here every second,
in my words, speaking from here. (PROLONGED APPLAUSE)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now I will really finish. Some businessmen are waiting
for me. (LAUGHTER) How do I change my discourse? Well, I will tell them
the same thing, honesty above all else. (LAUGHTER) I believe that in this
country there is a place for every honest person, for every sensitive person,
for every person who can listen to the message of the homeland and of the
times. I would say, the message of mankind is the one you should convey
to your fellow countrymen and women.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I already told you about a meeting attended by 600
economists from various countries, many very intelligent people from the
most diverse schools. We analyzed all these problems in depth. We did not
want a sectarian, leftist or rightist meeting. We even invited Mr. Friedman
but, of course, since he is now 82 he excused himself and said he could
not come. We also invited Mr. Soros to defend his points of view; the Chicago
Boys; the supply side monetarists; the neo-liberals, because what we wanted
was to discuss, and we discussed for five days beginning on a Monday and
concluding on a Friday.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">That meeting was the result of a suggestion I had
made at a meeting of Latin American economists. Many things were being
said so I told them that with all the problems we are facing now, why could
we not focus on the economic crisis and the problems of neo-liberal globalization?
And so we did. Hundreds of papers were sent and 55 of them were chosen
and all of them discussed. The others will be printed, the ones that were
not discussed. They were very interesting, very educational and instructive.
We were thinking of doing it every year. There is a forum in Davos, where
I do not know how many representatives of transnationals and all the rich
people in this world meet. Our small island can be a modest place where
those who have no transnationals or anything of the sort can meet. But
we are going to hold this meeting every year, based on the experience we
had this time.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I had to close that meeting which lasted for five
days. We had said: "Look, there will be no guitars to start the meeting."
Because, as you know, meetings often start with guitars, with choruses...</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Well, we had a chorus here, very well, a very good
one. (LAUGHTER) But I said: "The meeting is to begin exactly on time to
discuss the first paper." And we did that for five days: morning, afternoon
and evening sessions.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I had the task of closing the meeting and it was
already midnight when I started talking. If you allow me, and it will only
take some minutes, since it was very brief, (LAUGHTER) I would like to
repeat today what I said, because it covers very concisely the essence
of many of the things I have said here.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Esteemed delegates, observers and guests,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"You have honored me by asking but I will not make
a speech. I will limit myself to presenting a paper. I will do it in the
style of a cablegram and it will mostly be a dialogue with myself.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Month of July. Latin American and Caribbean Economists
Meeting. Subject: Serious world economic crisis in sight. Need to convene
an international conference. Focal point: Economic crisis and neo-liberal
globalization.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Extensive debate.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Every school of thought represented.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Exchange of arguments.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Work done along these lines.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Maximum possible reduction of expenses for everyone.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Morning, afternoon and evening sessions.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Exceptional seriousness and discipline have prevailed
during these five days.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"We have all expressed ourselves in absolute freedom.
We have made it. We are grateful.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"We have learned a lot from listening to you.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"A great variety and diversity of ideas. An extraordinary
show of scholarly spirit and talent clearly and beautifully expressed.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"We all have our convictions.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"We can all influence each other.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"In the long run, we shall all reach similar conclusions.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"My deepest convictions: the incredible and unprecedented
globalization under discussion is a product of historical evolution, a
fruit of human civilization achieved in a very short period of time, in
no more than 3000 years of the long presence of our ancestors on the planet.
They were already a completely developed specie. The man of today is not
more intelligent than Pericle, Plato or Aristotle, and we do not know as
yet if he is intelligent enough to solve today's extremely complex problems.
We are betting on his doing it. That is what we have dealt with at our
meeting.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"A question: Is it a reversible process? My answer,
the one I give to myself, is No.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"What kind of globalization have we today? A neo-liberal
globalization, that is what many of us call it. Is it sustainable? No.
Will it be able to subsist for long? Absolutely, no. Is it a matter of
centuries? Categorically, no. Will it last only decades? Yes, only decades.
But rather sooner than later it will cease to exist.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Do I believe myself to be a sort of prophet of fortune-teller?
No. Do I know much about economics? No. Hardly anything. To make this statement
it is enough to know how to add up, subtract, multiply and divide something
children learn in grammar school.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"How will such transition take place? We do not know.
Will it be through violent revolutions or devastating wars? That seems
unlikely, irrational and suicidal. Will it be through deep and catastrophic
crises? Unfortunately, this is most likely, almost inevitable and it will
happen through many different ways and forms of struggle.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"What kind of globalization will it be? It cannot
but be supportive, socialist, communist or whatever you want to call it.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Does nature, and the human species with it, have
much time left to survive in the absence of such change? Very little time.
Who will be the builders of that new world? The men and women who inhabit
our planet.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Which will be their basic weapons? Ideas will be,
and consciousness. Who will sow them, cultivate them and make them invincible?
You will. Is it a utopia, just one more dream among so many others? No,
because it is objectively inevitable and there is no alternative to it.
It has been dreamed of before, only perhaps too early. As the most visionary
of the sons and daughters of this island, Jos&eacute; Mart&iacute;, said:
"Today's dreams will be tomorrow's realities."</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"I have concluded my presentation. Thank you." (OVATION)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I am sorry I have been so imposing and I promise
you that in forty years, when you invite me again, I will be more concise.
(APPLAUSE AND EXCLAMATIONS: "FIDEL! FIDEL! FIDEL!")</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You were lucky I did not include the famous booklet.
You know what it was? The paper on the Synod in Rome, published in Mexico.
(SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE SAYS SOMETHING) I was not going to read it, but
much of what I underlined when reading this apostolic exhortation coincided
with many of the ideas I expressed here. I was going to use it as an evidence
that much of what is being thought today in the world on the calamitous
existing system does not only come from leftist sources, not only comes
from political sources. Arguments, expressions or contentions condemning
poverty, injustices, inequalities, neo-liberalism, the squandering of consumer
societies and many other social and human disasters resulting from the
present economic order imposed on the world also come from institutions
that cannot be suspected of Marxism, such as the Roman Catholic Church.
Many other Christian churches think likewise.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Perhaps it would have been best to come with this
paper and read what I had underlined. That way you would have been able
to leave four hours and a half earlier. (LAUGHTER)</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thank you, very much.</FONT>
