said: Good afternoon. I wanted to begin with a brief update on a matter which
is of interest to everyone who is here today, on the aid efforts following the
passage of hurricane Katrina, and on offers of aid coming from abroad”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>“Let me begin by
saying that we have received numerous and generous offers of aid from foreign
governments and organizations, and Secretary Rice, after consulting with the
White House, has made it clear that we will accept all foreign aid offers.
Anything that will help alleviate the difficult situation, the tragic situation
faced by people living in the area affected by hurricane Katrina will be
accepted”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>“We’ve received
general offers of aid and more specific ones from a number of countries and
organizations, including Russia, Japan, Canada, France, Honduras, Germany,
Venezuela, the OAS, Jamaica, NATO, Australia, the United Kingdom, Holland, Switzerland,
Greece, Hungary, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico, China,

almost at night, after the Assembly session ended, that we started to look at
the press wires, and we weren’t even able to read them all. Some of the news we
received in the morning, today, the piece I’ve just read among them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>This puts me in the
position of having to clarify Cuba’s position, because many of our friends,
within and outside the United States, who know that our country always offers
assistance when situations like these arise, regardless of existing conflicts,
political, ideological or any kind of difference, started calling us, thinking
it odd that we hadn’t offered any kind of aid to the United States following
the devastation wreaked by Katrina. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The calls kept coming
in, one after the other, so this declaration, whose text is self-explanatory,
became indispensable. Among other things, you can appreciate that it is not
simply a question of public relations —not in the least—but rather a matter of
importance, even from the practical point of view. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Many things have
happened. I’ve talked with thousands and thousands of American farmers, because
hundreds came for the first fair we held; I met with one group, then with
another, and, in the course of these last four years, <span style='mso-tab-count:

authorities, governors, senators and representatives. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

paid us a visit; she came, as governors do, because she was interested in
addressing matters and problems affecting her state. These states that have
been most severely affected by the hurricane are among the poorest. Agriculture
is most important in their economies, like ports used to export their products.

lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>“At 11:32 am on
August 30, 2005, I called our Minister of Foreign Affairs, our colleague
Felipe, to ask him to immediately convey to the government of the United
States, via the US Interests Section in Havana and Cuba’s Interests Section in
Washington, a message expressing our sympathies over the damage caused by the
hurricane and offering assistance in the area of health, as we knew from the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>If there is
anything we can offer that may be considered important —primarily thanks to the

the magnitude of the damage and the immense number of potential victims. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span

medical assistance. It wasn’t a ridiculous gesture, since sometimes a blood

you’re duty-bound to save it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a number of declarations by the population, insisting that not one of them be
removed; that they are attending to 2.5 millions of people who do not receive
any other kind of medical care from anyone else. Everyone mobilized to keep the
doctors there, and we said that we would never remove them on account of any
grievance, that we would not withdraw our medical assistance, unless the

have many friends in the United States, and around 200 well-known names,
administrative authorities from those southern states, with whom our

large number of activities related to the buying, shipment and transportation
of food and the payment of this, because we have been paying for this food in
cash now for four years, without ever being late and without ever paying even a
penny less. We have developed really strong relations, based on trust. We extended
our condolences to the authorities, to everyone, and they took it well, they
were grateful. We told them that we had informed the top </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

doctors and resources, but they also have a special situation in a specific
area, due to a specific problem. This is no cause for shame. What I am sure of
is that it is very difficult to get all the teams necessary to where all those
people from the south are in 12 hours, or in 24 hours. It is impossible to
conjure up a doctor for extreme situations, it is impossible to conjure up a
trained general practitioner for this task, or a team of men that will go
anywhere. On the other hand, this isn’t the first time for us, this isn’t a new

use X-ray machines, ultrasound equipment, endoscopes, and how to treat many
