thank our generous and heroic people for the privilege of commemorating this
anniversary of the assault on the “Moncada” and “Carlos Manuel de Cespedes” garrisons
when so much time has passed since those events took place. It could be that no
one has even received such a great honor. It would be unforgivable not to keep
in mind that more than 70 percent of the Cubans who today keep the Revolution
alive had not even been born back then. They took the banners which, I think,
they will never drop, from those who gave their lives in that action. I dare to
say thank you on my behalf and on behalf of all of them, because on my
conscience lies the enormous weight of having persuaded them to undertake such
a bold action and yet fate has not prevented me from traveling the long, long
road of revolutionary struggle down to this emotional moment 52 years later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the beginning of this year, these actions were complemented by the act of

practical effects of this have been: an increase in savings made in Cuban pesos

year a rational centralization of decisions concerning the use of hard currency
has been established. Authorization for these transactions must be obtained
before obligations are contracted, which has led to a more effective process of
contracting and a greater commitment to honoring the payment. Furthermore, this
has contributed considerably to the fight against crime and corruption. It has
also helped to make important decisions to get rid of the commercial middlemen
that are not representative in international commerce, whose activity brought
about a disproportioned increase in the prices of the goods and services that
the country purchases abroad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
