<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We had planned to gather for this ceremony
exactly one year after the first was held, on October 20, to celebrate Cuban
Culture Day on the day a new crop of art instructors, educated in the schools
born of the creative spirit of our Battle of Ideas, graduated, but
unpredictable and powerful hurricane Wilma obliged us to postpone this
much-awaited gathering until today. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Some of you, from the eastern provinces,
were already in the capital when, two days before, we decided to postpone this
celebration because of hurricane Wilma’s dangerous proximity to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>. I know that, as a result of this, you
have been in the capital for over a week now. Surely, you understand that we
could not have sent you back home while that complex meteorological situation
was still affecting us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Today, 3,092 of the 3,879 students who
began their studies in the 2001-2002 school year graduate as art instructors;
the second year to graduate from these institutions, which were opened on </span><st1:date
Year="2001" Day="18" Month="2"><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>February
 18, 2001</span></st1:date><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> as part
of a program aimed at graduating 30,000 art instructors over the course of 10
years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Of these graduates, 60.4 % are female and
39.5 % are male. Most of them come from working-class families. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>These newly graduates, equipped with
practical skills and experience, were assigned to 3,048 educational
institutions, including </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>’s 26 polytechnic institutes specializing
in informatics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>With this new group of graduates, Cuba has
6,318 art instructors, which means that at least one art instructor can be
assigned to each of the 4,898 pre-schools, grammar schools, special education
schools, junior and senior high schools. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Thus, a marvelous avenue is opening
leading to the education of the youngest generations in the appreciation and
sensitivity towards the arts while paving the way for the ambitious purpose of
attaining a widespread comprehensive general culture for all of our people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>We want for our people to be
knowledgeable not only in the arts, but also in history, science, economics,
geography, the environment and the most varied fields of knowledge, and to have
a profoundly humanitarian conscience. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We are pleased to know that from the two
graduations combined, 6,147 youths have decided to pursue higher studies and
that, of these, 3,555 will pursue a Bachelor’s Degree in Art Instruction. These
young people accumulate an immense amount of knowledge that is essential to the
lofty aim of creating a society of justice where everyone is given equal
opportunities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The “José Martí” Brigade, created exactly
one year ago today, is a special source of encouragement for these young art instructors,
inspiring them to continue with their education, to be disciplined and
organized and to commit themselves wholeheartedly to their tasks. With the establishment
of its full structure, the Brigade under the direction of the Council of State
was fully assembled this past May 19, on the 110<sup>th</sup> anniversary of
the death in combat of our national independence hero.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The revolution has given the Young
Communists League the huge political task, of contributing to the success of
the art instructors’ program, which had a false start in the past but is fruit
of our dreams for a better and more educated society. The Young Communists
League is responsible for coordinating the work of the “José Martí” Brigade. It
must ensure the quality of its work, that it improves itself constantly and
that its members honor their commitments. Supporting the work of YCL members
who coordinate the Brigade efforts at the municipal and provincial levels is a
top priority for this youth organization. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>After a year of work, art instructors are
working with 480,526 children and adolescents at schools and to 85,599 in art
workshops. Efforts to enhance artistic talent and cultivate art appreciation
are also undertaken by Cultural Centers, which organize activities for 227,390
children and adolescents; this figure will be more than multiplied in coming
years, when the contingent of young people who today study to become art instructors
reaches all of the country’s schools and communities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Numerous anecdotes have been pulled
together from all over the country, telling of work experiences during this
past school year. They show just how many possibilities to improve human beings
are opened up by the work and guidance of art instructors who work in schools,
correctional centers, prisons and other social institutions. Here are some
anecdotes, told by the very art instructors or their coordinators:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>What does Yennys García Betancourt have to
say? Specialty: theatre. ‘Fernando Cuesta Piloto’ National Urban School. </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cienfuegos</span></st1:PlaceName><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> </span><st1:PlaceType><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Municipality</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Well, I hadn’t included this one with a
number of other comments but as I’ve already mentioned it, I can’t leave it out
now; it was due to some words. She said: “My school is in the heart of the
People’s Council of San Lázaro, many of whose inhabitants” —this is where I
disagree with Yennys García Betancourt. I didn’t want to include this comment,
but the people who transcribed my notes made a mistake; I had crossed it out
and it made it here anyway. She must be an excellent instructor, but she said:
“Many of its inhabitants have a low educational level and criminal
backgrounds”. That’s a bit too much to say, I disagree; I know our people and I
know some are more humble than others; but all Cubans had extremely low levels
of education before. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We didn’t know a thing about anything in
the past; 30% of us were illiterate, 90% semi-illiterate, and we were very far
from something like what we are witnessing today, a phenomenon that is so
impressive, so exciting; we were very far from something like what we witnessed
several weeks ago, I mean, the graduation of doctors from Cuba and other
countries; the creation of the Henry Reeve contingent, whose members, more than
1,000 in number, are now in the two places where the most trying and dramatic
catastrophes of recent times have occurred: one, in response to the hurricanes,
in Guatemala, the other, in response to the earthquakes, which resulted in the
deaths of more than 50,000 people and injured more than 80,000 others, 90% of
whom are suffering traumas due to fractures of the upper or lower extremities
or other parts of the body. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>It is easy to enumerate the dead and
injured, but one must think of the terrible sorrow and suffering of those
victims, those human beings directly affected by the tragedy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>All of you surely remember the day when,
while participating in the graduation ceremony, I stumbled and fell; I wasn’t
paying attention, I was looking at you, there in Santa Clara, when I fell and shattered
my knee-cap in eight pieces, and the upper part of my right arm, where I had
something a bit more serious than fissures, what I thought I had at the time;
that was perhaps the most serious and most trying injury. I remember how I
suffered. Before then, I knew of this kind of suffering through others; but I
went through the experience myself, and that is why I speak with so much
passion when I recall so much suffering and so much sorrow caused by these
catastrophes (Applause).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Let me continue commenting on what comrade
Yennys said, which is very interesting. She said: “At first, I was a bit afraid
at having to work with children of such peculiar backgrounds. I started with a
group in the fourth grade, described as the school’s most difficult group. I
would never have expected and was overwhelmed by the affection the children
showed me”. Just imagine this girl, she’s practically a girl. I remember very
well how we chose the students for the program. They were students completing their
junior high school, and were going to enroll in a special 4-year senior high
school program, to live as boarder students in the art instructors’ schools
created that year, in the course of that one year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I remember the program, when we discussed
each and every subject, until it was up and running and, and of course, as you
would expect, as it’s with everything, it is still being improved. The students
were very young; generally speaking, you are the youngest graduates we have. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I remember, for instance, the graduation of
social workers. I’m not sure what it’s going to be like when we meet with them
because, not counting all of their relatives, you need more than two stadiums
or sport complexes, if you will, a coliseum like this one, with capacity for
15,000 people, to house them, and they also constitute an immensely powerful
force that is already having a huge impact on our society. What a force! No one
dare underestimate these young people, much less the nouveaux riches and the
thieves, because they will help eliminate a number of evils that still plague
our society, as we try to build a better world closer to the people than it has
ever been over the course of history. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Let no one think they are stupid, or
illiterate, or ignorant, because it is they who are working and who today are
ensuring that our country earns hundreds of millions of dollars that were lost
or squandered; and I would go further because, including electricity, and all
sources of energy, including many other things, the sum which our country will
have available shortly is much higher than the one I mentioned, and no
hurricane will stop us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>One has already passed and is now
forgotten or, better said, it was crushed by the work our people are carrying
out. And there was the other that turned </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Havana</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> into </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Venice</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, and the world was getting nervous, while
thousands of Cubans made use of every available resource to restore normality
in a matter of days. In the meantime, planes were carrying brigades belonging
to the Henry Reeve contingent south-west, to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Guatemala</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, or south-east, to far-off </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Pakistan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, to reach regions that are 3,000 or 4,000
meters above sea-level. We are talking of the Himalayan mountain side, whence </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Mount Everest</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> emerges, a symbol of that summit which
the peoples of this world, our people included, aspire to reach in the social
field and in terms of justice, a summit which no one has reached, not in
millennia. But I do believe that today, at a time when we face more
difficulties than ever, no other country in the world is as close to that peak
as ours is. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Neither nature nor the empire will be able
to crush our people’s spirit, nor prevent us from reaching our goals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I’ll continue with what that young girl said,
she’s practically a little girl. That is why we cannot be critical, not in the
least, if she used a certain phrase because she didn’t write it for
publication, she didn’t write it for anyone else, those who transcribed it for
potential inclusion in a speech were in such a rush, perhaps, that they didn’t
even notice what it said. It’s not important, anyway. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>She said: “I started with a group in the
fourth grade, described as the school’s most difficult group. I would never
have expected and was overwhelmed by the affection the children showed me”. The
children from that neighborhood, which is probably very poor and must have
areas where living conditions are very hard. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Hassan must remember it, because he
visited the city’s poorest quarters with medical students during the first
years of the Battle of Ideas; he visited those places in search of testimonies
and to help tens of thousands of children, and we would receive news about
these places every day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>She continued to say: “…and they were so
taken with my theatre classes that I put together a theatre group with most of
my students, the Abracadabra group, which today represents the school. The most
difficult part was convincing the parents, using a thousand persuasive
arguments, to let their children rehearse at extra-curricular hours”. What does
that mean? Saturday, Sunday, in the afternoon, in the morning? At what time,
before or after the power cuts? (Laughter) “I met with them on several
occasions, and receiving their support during the preparation of our screen plays
was something unexpected”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>“The mother of one of my students was in
prison”. It’s sad, isn’t it? But that doesn’t make the town or neighborhood a
den of criminals. Society is the one guilty of those crimes, because those
neighborhoods didn’t materialize out of thin air; the civilized and cultured
order that conquered us and exploited us for centuries, that brought slavery
with it and established a society of abysmal differences which lasted until the
triumph of the revolution in 1959, with very, very, very rich people, who
didn’t live over there in San Lázaro, they lived in La Víbora first—there are some
remnants of that society, no, not anymore, there are working-class families
there now— and then they moved to what is today Plaza, and then they moved to
what used to be Miramar and is today a part of Plaza, or over there, near the
Country Club which existed at the time the revolution triumphed, there were
many places like that there, they were there, as I recall, over there, near

the Commander was saying, working with that difficult group was an
extraordinary experience. You know that all children are restless, joyful but,
well, those children had special characteristics. So, I got there and I set out
to change things and to bring art into classroom, which is the great task all
of us art instructors have, that is the reason this project came into being;
get children to mingle with each other and help them get along with each other
better, communicate better, and, so I rolled up my sleeves and started to work
with them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>It’s very difficult for all art
instructors at the beginning, because every school is something new, something
unknown, but the children who received me were full of joy. To my surprise, the
parents, after they realized how important theatre was to their children and
how it was changing them, started to help me with the preparations for the play
we were staging, with the rehearsals of the artistic group. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>There was another child I taught in that
community, whose mom was in jail and whose family had a number of problems. The
important thing is that I managed to get that child involved in art and that
his classmates began to accept him better when they saw him develop
artistically. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>That’s what’s important about our work,
and I believe all of us art instructors have similar experiences, because there
are always people and children, all children have that fantasy hidden
somewhere, and that’s why we’re here, that is our reason for being, to dispel
the world’s darkness, the darkness of problems, to dispel whatever traumas
children may have and to bring out that beautiful bit of sunshine in them. I
think that is the most important part of each and every one of our experiences

splendid little girl in the school who filled me with joy. Whoever doesn’t know
her and hears her sing might say she’s in an art school, but she’s not. She’s a
little country girl who, until recently, didn’t even know what a musical
instrument was. Her voice, however, impresses everyone. I decided to have one
of my students, who plays the guitar, provide the musical accompaniment for a
song I had her sing. The results were excellent. Those who watched and listened
to her performance were very moved by the talent of this little girl, who had

since his arrival at the community, life has not been the same. He put together
a group of people with craftsmanship skills and improved the appearance of that
remote place with crafts and murals depicting natural settings. They tell us
that, thanks to him, they have come into contact with and been able to
appreciate visual arts and even hold exhibitions there, on the mountain, where
prizes have been awarded. Eliécer tells us he was lucky to have been assigned
to work in that area; he confesses that, at first, he did not want to go, but
that, after arriving there and seeing that he had the opportunity to change the
lives of those people, he didn’t give it a second thought and has remained
there to this day. He feels he has become a more sensitive person and loves

understand the need of assigning me to work in a correctional school, bearing

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>“I
won’t deny that I was a little scared when I first got there. I had never before
worked in a prison as an instructor. I was surprised by how well received we
were; they welcomed our initiative. It fell on them to break the ice and they
did an impressive job. A band that played non conventional instruments (sticks,
cans, buckets) performed. They actually played very well. One of them
approached me, he wanted to show me a play he had written about his life as an
inmate and the lessons he was learning there. This has taught me that we should
not underestimate people when they are willing to change and turn to art as
means to do so”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Following a year of work and experiences
like the ones we have just read about, 123 of the best brigade members will go
on to staff the Schools for Art Instructors, which have grown and today have a
total of 2,950 professors; of these, 799 teach general subjects and 2,151 teach
the various specialties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>More than 370 graduates from higher education
institutions, specializing in music or visual arts, have also become professors
in these schools. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The contribution of artists and
intellectuals who have joined in these educational efforts has been truly
valuable. What we need even more than this contribution is the participation of
the artistic vanguard in our efforts to forge this new generation of instructors,
who have already become an indispensable force in the colossal struggle to
raise the overall educational level of our people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>In May 2000, when the decision to begin
this program was made, we had a mere 2,000 instructors in the whole country.
Today, counting the students who are working in schools and graduates who staff
the abovementioned centers, we have a total of 22,025 youths in this program. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>A few days ago, the sixth school year of
our 15 Schools for Art Instructors began. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Today’s students have enrolled in their
courses with a better sense of what specialties they will pursue. Whereas only
7% of those young people who enrolled in the first academic year had some prior
artistic instruction, 41% of those who have enrolled this year have some knowledge
of art thanks to the amateur movement, received classes from a teacher or come
from a vocational art school. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Enrollment continues to be predominantly
female (64.5%) and about half of our future art instructors come from
working-class families. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>In keeping with the principles of justice
and equality that inspire our project, these schools have been opened to young
people with disabilities since the time of their creation; programs of study
have been adjusted to meet the needs of these young people, without diminishing
the quality of the education provided. In the year which has just ended, 43
young people with disabilities were enrolled in classes; of these, 18 have
physical and motor disabilities, 8 are blind, 2 deaf, 7 deaf and dumb, 4
visually impaired and 1 suffers from a visual and physical-motor disability.
Eight of these youths graduate here today and join the ranks of the noble and
enterprising army of art instructors, as is their due right, demonstrating that
no obstacles are insurmountable for human beings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We have continued to improve the
curriculum; the program of studies for the specialties of music, theatre and
dance have been modified to offer students a more comprehensive education that
is more in tune with the activities they will carry out as art instructors.
Workshops on other art disciplines are offered in all specialties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>A considerable greater number of
audiovisual instruments and computers, and extraordinary teaching tools, have
been made available to the schools. There is now one computer for every 15
students. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The 8 software packages employed in
general post-secondary education are used, in addition to one which was
designed specifically for the Art Appreciation and History course taught at the
Schools for Art Instructors. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Research is not separate from study,
appreciation or teaching of arts. The scientific conferences in which teachers
and members of the “José Martí”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Brigade
participate every school year encourage the creation of teaching instruments
that help develop workshops, contribute to the overall improvement of the
educational process and offer those who have graduated as art instructors a
space to share rewarding experiences in their work with children and
adolescents. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>The maintenance and restoration of the 15
schools for art instructors continues; most of these schools were set up in
former educational facilities which were made functional again as part of the
feverish, creative process set in motion by the Battle of Ideas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We must pay attention to every detail to make
these schools a model of education, discipline, creativity, ethics and morale. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We hope that all first course graduates
who are still working will honor their commitment to work as art instructors
for no less than 5 years, as was first agreed, and that those who graduate
today will work for no less than 8, as they vowed, in that beautiful profession
that takes spiritual treasures and knowledge to all corners of the nation, to
children and adolescents especially, and which guarantees a brighter and wiser
future for all Cubans. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Central state administrative bodies must
respect this commitment, and refrain from usurping art instructors to use them
in other areas, as they did in the past, because this will not be tolerated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>And take heed, about this and many other
things; we have the case of the art instructors, for instance. There is also the
case of those who are graduating as physical education and sports teachers and
we are witnessing this pirate-like brain-drain there as well. Let he who is
without sin cast the first stone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Yes, very few have not been guilty of
brain-drain from one sector to another. Party cadres, yes, revolutionary people
who wanted to be cadres but who didn’t know a thing, who had no experience, who
weren’t even experienced in the building of socialism, they got mixed up in all
sorts of silly things and entangled in red tape; but brain-drain between
sectors betrays a lack of revolutionary ethics. “This is a good professor, so
I’m taking him with me because he’s trained”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>That’s the way many teachers were taken
away of their profession in the first years of the revolution; they needed
someone who knew how to read and write, so they took one from here, another one
from there: “I’ll give you this”, “you’ll be closer from home”. There was a
kind of feudal war going on, it must be said. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>For instance, the case of Cuba’s Central
Bank, an extremely important institution that is becoming more and more
important; they were training programmers there, people versed in computer
sciences, and other state bodies, who weren’t offering any kind of training,
would come to them and say: “I have this really nice hotel, there’s a good
salary and tips in it for you”. Or they would say: “Look, I’m taking this
teacher with me for him to teach this, that and the other”. They were always
tempting people, offering them things, and these are capitalist vices,
capitalist habits, no one can imagine the number of things like that that were
done. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>A society that aims to be different, a new
society that sets high goals for itself, drags with it all of the vices of that
corrupt society it wishes to change. These vices weigh down on it. Only time
and work, if one works hard can make the difference. And nothing is more common
and widespread in the world than the mistakes of revolutionaries, of those who
want to change society or change the world. That is why only a few revolutions
achieve progress and no few of them, of the few, end up failing over the course
of historical periods. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I believe our country is making a huge effort
to move forward and that this is perhaps due to the strength of its adversary,
the magnitude of the difficulties it faces, which have forced all of us, in one
way or another, to improve ourselves. And we will most likely continue to make
progress and to be in the lead as we move towards that goal we call “a better
world”, the goals we have set for ourselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>What we were doing to each other was
shameful, perhaps explainable at first because almost no one knew how to read
or write. Then, they would go to a school and lure the teacher away. That
happened for many years and it happens still. Today, of course, they would like
to lure a university professor, but they can’t offer him just any job, any
position like pushing papers behind a desk. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Central state administrative bodies must
respect this commitment “and refrain from the embarrassing practice of usurping
art instructors, as was done in the past, as this will not be tolerated”. I
don’t know what they could do with an art instructor eager to do something else
or who forgets his promise and wants to become an artist. The instructor may
have an exceptional talent, I don’t doubt that many of them will become
artists, great artists even, I got this impression when I visited that school
in Boyeros. But they have a duty, the revolution has trained them for a certain
task and doesn’t chain them to that task for life, though we know that many
will be so enamored of their profession, young people like you, that they will
devote their entire lives to providing an education to their fellow citizens,
to forging revolutionaries, to forging talents in the art world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

miserable millions, which the generous donors spent in five-star hotels. We
warned them: “We don’t need that petty handout”, and, when they persisted with
their insults, the people protested, in front of their embassies, more than
500,000 people protested in front of each of their embassies, and so many
people were out there that a third, simultaneous protest march could have been organized;
make no mistake. And when they came, we said to them: “No, we don’t want any
humanitarian aid”, we can actually even offer it to you, because you have less
doctors per capita than we do, and there are people there who go blind because
they can’t afford surgery and you don’t have the qualified professionals we do,
nor can you send a team of doctors to any corner of the world. All you can do
is threaten to intervene, threaten to bomb; and that’s where the Yankee lunatic
has gone asking for a hand, to </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
 style='font-family:Arial'>Europe</span></st1:place><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>What can </span><st1:place><span
 lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Europe</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> do to us? It can do nothing. Thank God
there’s a country that can say that. A country that doesn’t need the Yankees,
that doesn’t need </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Europe</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>. We are part of a changing world and we
are a strong revolution and a formidable people that knows how to fight against
its adversaries and to struggle against its own errors and its own weaknesses
(Applause). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Let them carry on with their nonsense and
their mercenary ways. No one will be able to place </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>’s art education in mercenary hands; they
will try, no doubt, to steal, and they do often manage to steal talented people
and artists (Applause). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>You will be the professors of tomorrow,
and so will other young people who are studying today, artists who build consciences
and forge minds, who are not indolent or unconscious and forget that a child
who beings studying an art form when he is five, six or seven years old, who
goes through an art school, who has the opportunity to study at an art
institution free of charge, will later shine as an artist, as the true wealth
of talent we give our people will one day shine forth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>A moral consciousness must be forged early
on if we are to be spared the ingratitude of some who reach the top of the
ladder in the art world and surprise us with their desertion; one day we get
the news: “so and so didn’t come back”. And why does so and so do not come
back, if not because they are lacking in conscience, in love for the people who
nurtured them and gave them everything, in spite of the blockade, in spite of
the sacrifices demanded, in spite of threats? (Applause). They owe to those
workers who cut sugar cane, who drove tractors, who worked for endless hours,
in agriculture, in industry, anywhere; at a primary school, at a secondary
school, at a university, everywhere. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>A revolution is the triumph of virtue over
vice, the triumph of honor over dishonor, the triumph of moral and patriotic
integrity over mercenary impulses and vice; the most those who cannot build
values on ethical foundations can do is to steal talents, because talents are
formed spontaneously in many of those countries, through the initiative of the
citizens themselves, there are no art schools for everyone like here: they
exist only for the rich or very rich. In our country, they are open to everyone,
without exception (Applause). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We were talking about teachers, those who
educate, who create for the benefit of everyone, and of those who steal from us
and want to take our artists and athletes, or our brains in any field of
science. As with everything else, they also tried to take all of our doctors
and, of the 6,000 we had, not all of them experienced, they took half, 3,000.
This did not prevent us from reaching the figure of 70,000 today. More than
25,000, according to calculations I must verify, are studying medicine today.
We have an enrollment of 7,000 every year; more than 12,000 are studying at the
Latin American School of Medical Sciences; 20,000 Latin American students, most
of them from the region’s poorest countries, will begin courses in the first
quarter of next year. And nothing but respect will be read in the eyes of those
who attempted to deprive this country of doctors. Now, they see an entire
nation transformed into a university training professionals in many
specialties, most importantly in that humane specialty that restores health and
saves lives: medicine. History has already meted out due punishment for the
crimes they committed against us. You will see 100,000 doctors come out of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, because we are helping to train doctors for
the whole world, while they haven’t a single doctor they can send anywhere
(Applause). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Mercenary attitudes will never give us an
internationalist doctor; mercenary attitudes will never give us a valuable and
glorious contingent specialized in natural disasters, epidemics and serious
illnesses like AIDS, which is the scourge of entire nations and continents,
almost to the point of obliterating their populations; and they cannot prevent
us from offering aid, because, for each and every one of those doctors we had,
those they stole from us, some 3,000 of them, there are 8 times that number
participating in internationalist missions or helping peoples in times of
immense pain. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>First they took 3,000 and then others who
had graduated; and, in spite of that, we now have 25,000 doctors, a new type of
doctor, offering their services in the </span><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
 style='font-family:Arial'>Third World</span></st1:place><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'>. And, here in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, nearly 50,000 of them keep working. How
many times the original number? Fifteen, sixteen or seventeen times,
distributed across all of the country’s municipalities, reaching all corners of
our nation, from Sandino, next to </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We are well aware that our system is not
perfect, but no other country has ever had as many doctors working so close to
the population as we do. No other country has ever had what we have in greater
and greater numbers: networks of <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>outpatient clinics, that is to say, primary
care centers, and not only that but also physical rehabilitation centers attached
to those clinics, which now have equipment they never had before, new
standardized equipment, which can be maintained and repaired, something which
becomes impossible when you have 40 or 50 different brands in use, as was the
case until recently in our country, and those <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>outpatient clinics are already becoming a
model and centers offering training for doctors. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>There will be tens, or rather hundreds and
hundreds of university campuses offering medical programs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>This, of course, isn’t talked about much
in cables, no, or on television or the radio, which are crammed full of ads and
official lies. The governments behind these media have a lot of nerve. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>You recall that we asked Mr. Bush:” Okay,
sir, tell us how Posada Carriles entered the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, tell us where it was he entered the
country, on what ship, through what port, and who were the people responsible
for letting him in, who were his accomplices”. An answer is well overdue, many
months have gone by, and they haven’t uttered a word on the subject. They deal
with the problem by keeping mum, by not answering a single question, because
there are many people involved there, in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> government, who authorized Posada
Carriles entry into the country, that terrorist, that heartless murderer they
now support and shield from justice. They haven’t said a word, and we’ve raised
a lot of public questions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>When we expressed our willingness to send
doctors to aid the people of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, who had to fend for themselves in the

  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, they kept quiet. It was our duty to
offer this aid to the people of the United States: it was thanks to that people
that US troops were pulled out of Vietnam; it was thanks to that people that
Elian was returned to our country; and it is that people which, sooner rather
than later, will force the empire to pull its troops out of Iraq, where more
than 2,000 young US soldiers have died as a result of a merciless and unjust
war (Applause). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We were offering them aid at a time when
retired citizens were receiving no assistance and dying in homes, or in
hospitals, where chaos prevailed and the cry of “everyone for himself!”
reverberated through halls. We wanted to help them. And our doctors could have
saved many lives; despite this, they didn’t even mention that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> was one of the countries that had offered
aid. All the while, our friends in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> kept wondering: “How odd that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> hasn’t offered any aid!” Total official
silence! They forced us to declare what we had done, and that we had been among
the first to offer aid. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>And when another hurricane was heading
towards them again, we weren’t among the first, we were the only ones that,
days before the hurricane hit, offered them aid. There was no response that
time around either; only silence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Yesterday, I elaborated on the note they
sent us not long ago, the remarks of the US Interests Section official, the
kind remarks, in reference to the need for </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Mexico</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

matters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Immediately, there were cables announcing
that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:

style='font-family:Arial'> had accepted the aid; yesterday, I went over
documents to show you the words we used and the points we made in our response.
Now all of that is being talked about. But they shed no light, as a rule they
steer clear of the difficult questions, they still haven’t<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>told us, for instance, they haven’t dared to
tell us, nor could they tell us without incriminating themselves, how and where
the most heinous and disgusting terrorist in the western hemisphere entered the
United States. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Today,
they refuse to release five Cuban heroes who fought against terrorism, five

corruption of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I don’t see </span><st1:place><span

trial had been unfair, that that trial wasn’t worth a damn; however, they are
still in jail. That is how the imperial system works, shamelessly and without
ethics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>But how strong </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> has become! </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> is so strong it can look the empire’s
European accomplices in the eye, it can look them straight in the eye and
accuse them, say to them: you are hypocrites, you are corrupt, you are immoral,
you are exploiters, you created modern slavery, in past centuries, following
what came to be known as the discovery of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>. You created colonialism and have kept it
alive to this day. You, and the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, created uneven trade; you steal hard
currency from all countries by forcing them to deposit their reserves, both
public and private, in the banks of rich countries, fleeing from inflation and
taking refuge in it: that is how you keep all of the world’s money at your
fingertips. That is why I say to you: you are pillagers, you are thieves and,
despite all that, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>’s money is not yours for the taking. The
empire’s insolent dollar, however, a dollar that has been taught a few lessons
already, continues to bleed us dry in the most brutal manner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>That is what we told Maradona during the
first interview he did with us, when we showed him that in a blockaded country,
in which many products and services are still rationed and subsidized, an insolent
dollar, which they send from over there and can be changed not for 26 but for
24 Cuban pesos, because our peso is gaining in value, with that dollar, for
example, you can pay for 150 kilowatts of electricity. And how much do people
pay, how much do they pay if they consume more electricity? A mere two dollars
for 300 kilowatts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>That is the purchasing power of that
dollar they send to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>Cuba</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>, and how much does the Cuban state have
to pay for each kilowatt of electricity? No less than 36 dollars for the same
number of kilowatts, and this is a conservative estimate, if we calculated the
costs more precisely we would probably see that it was more. That is to say,
they send one dollar and it costs us 18 in convertible hard currency. They send
two and it costs 36 dollars. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>That’s what they do with many other
things, and our people, being pillaged in this manner, many times didn’t
receive, --this was the case until recently and it’s starting to change--
enough soap, the kind that’s rationed and odorless,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>without perfume, or enough toothpaste, or
women’s pads in sufficient quantities. We know this well, because, recently,
the light industry sector was instructed to step up production to increase the
quantity of soap and to perfume it a bit; to increase toothpaste and pad
volumes, so that there would be enough for everyone. This plan has already been
set in motion. This sector has even received instructions to increase those
figures considerably. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>So, the country is making efforts in this
connection but, all the while, how much money is it spending to subsidize the
dollar, multiplying the purchasing power of the dollar?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>It is not my intention to go into details
about all of this here, but I am letting you know of the situation and I’m
letting you know in advance, because we have to work together to put an end to
this kind of pillaging, this kind of exploitation. What we’ve done is not
enough, we know well what we have to do, we have to adhere to the principle of
a minimum of opportunities for the parasites; a minimum of opportunities for
those who receive that currency that is helping to pillage our country,
whatever currency it is, because our country has accumulated enough experience
to do things correctly and to prevent things like that from ever happening
again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Our country moves toward military
invulnerability and, take heed, towards economic invulnerability; and what
those thousands of social workers, which are only a small, active part of the
social workers we have, are doing is fighting to achieve Cuba’s economic
invulnerability, and the principle they are striving to make a reality is the
principle of giving the most to those who work, to those who receive a salary
or a pension as workers in factories, professionals, teachers, doctors, workers
in any walk of life. Yes, those should be the ones who benefit the most. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>As revolutionaries who strive for a better
world and a much fairer society, who are today much more experienced people and
can take bigger steps toward those aims, we must build a society in which human
beings earn a living by working, or receive from society what they deserve for
having worked all their lives, who have helped us advance two thirds of the way
towards our aims, aims we will have reached in the not-so-distant future. We
also cannot forget to share part of what we have, and all of our experience and
knowledge, with other peoples of the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I insist that are well aware of the many
of the things we are doing today, I must say this to our people (Applause). And
we won’t be any poorer for helping others, nor will we deprive ourselves of
anything. The heroic struggle of our people has plowed the fields of time, and
there we shall sow the seeds of that better society and world of which the
doctors that filled this stadium, this stadium you now fill and will be filled
by social workers tomorrow, are a part; doctors who are not only conscious
human beings and who struggle against unjustifiable wrongs, but who also
inspire those people who, not being social workers, are at their side in this
struggle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>And when in each of the people’s councils,
everywhere, when each and every citizen begins to do what these social workers
are doing today and members of the Committees for the Defense of the
Revolution, of women’s organizations, when combatants of the revolution,
workers, students, members of all grassroots organizations and the Young
Communists League and the Party begin to struggle for the same things these
social workers are struggling today, these workers who are aware of what’s
going on, of the nouveaux riches who do not want to pay their due and those who
accept bribes or allow themselves to be bribed, then it will be much more
difficult for these people to do what they are doing today. I am absolutely
certain of this. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>For instance, we could teach the
government of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-family:Arial'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'> how to protect the population in case of a
natural disaster; this could help save the lives of many poor people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>I believe Miami is experiencing major
power failures caused by the hurricanes, that it’s without food, without
anything, and I know that the 100,000 citizens here who were affected by
coastal flooding have been receiving food, have been assisted in every way
possible and that social workers are drawing up an inventory of all the things
that were damaged, to help them recover what they lost in as short a time as
possible. That is what we know is happening, and what will always happen
whenever there’s a disaster of this nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>So, with respect to brain-drain between
state institutions: well, will radio and television channels hire art
instructors? Will the Art and Film Institute hire them? Will the people’s
theaters hire art students or teachers and put them to work there?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Who will engage in this sort of piracy? We
hope that no one will. I’m looking at Ernesto, head of a television channel,
I’m positive he won’t be so undisciplined, I’m sure the heads of government
institutions won’t be so undisciplined, I’m sure tourist agencies won’t be so
undisciplined, I’m sure state bodies won’t scoop up young people who have
completed their education, who are programmers or who are versed in computer
science, because there are 40,000 programming students in polytechnic
institutes that specialize in computer science, forty thousand! And there are
8,000 at the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span lang=EN-US

—this is a figure of speech—, to cut off the thief’s hand, that’s from the time
of the Talion law. I studied law and have forgotten many things but I do
remember the Talion law, which made the punishment correspond to the crime, (an
eye for an eye) which doesn’t actually involve cutting anyone’s hand off, but
rather that anyone who ‘misappropriates’ qualified personnel should not be
permitted to keep their job. Take heed, I say this on behalf of the revolution,
on behalf of the Party, on behalf of the state, whoever is guilty of these ‘piracy’
between institutions, or any similar acts, will not remain in their positions
for long. It is time to put those mistakes behind us for good. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

one of the greatest writers that the literary history of this hemisphere has
known, Gabriel Garcia Marquez. There, Marquez described the steps </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

informed them that that terrorist group, whose mastermind was Posada Carriles,
was planning to blow up planes in mid flight with US citizens on board. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>Following the wave of unsuccessful
terrorist actions against Cuban hotels, actions that were discovered and
frustrated before they were carried out, these terrorists had an embarrassing
situation in their hands and were thinking about blowing up planes from airlines
with regular flights to Cuba using the same procedure: getting mercenaries on
the plane, placing a bomb inside that could be set off 50, 60, even 90 hours
later, when these planes had long left the country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>We informed US government officials of this,
we offered them information, sharing with them precisely the kind of
information that our comrades, who are today in prison, were obtaining when
they infiltrated terrorist groups seeking for information that could serve to
protect our people. They, of course, were not the only ones who did this, but
they were part of the mechanism the country used to obtain information and
prevent acts like those mentioned. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>You recall what happened. Even the FBI was
asked to look into it, to verify these claims, every investigative tool was
made available to them, and, days later, they went out hunting for clues,
perhaps they already had some, and they arrested these comrades and subjected
them to the atrocious proceedings we know of. They are kept separate from each other;
they can’t even talk to one another. They have close relatives who have not
been able to go and see them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span

against the revolution, that has every right to fight against the mercenaries
who support terrorists, who support the blockade, who support the cowardly
actions undertaken against our country, say nothing of those they keep locked
away in prison. They haven’t a shred of decency left in them, they are amoral
from head to toe, as they have always been, since their very emergence as
industrialized nations, as exploiters of peoples, exploiters of continents and
of the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span

false. They never said a word. They never even said if they had received that
report or not, or whether the FBI looked into it or not; or if it was true that
the FBI traveled to Cuba, that the FBI received this or that piece of
information, much of which was obtained by our comrades who are kept in prison
there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt'><span

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>No one’s heard anything about this,
they’re not saying anything, they’re not talking, and they babble about freedom
of the press and journalists without borders. Journalists without borders and
journalists without honor, who spread lies and make a living serving the
empire, it’s not the same thing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
