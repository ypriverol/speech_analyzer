compatriots;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It
goes without saying that this is a very special occasion. I have been watching <span
class=SpellE>Elián</span> and I have to say that I feel as moved as he to be at
this forum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
mustn’t go on for too long, it’s quite hot and we have been lucky that the rain
has respected our ceremony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
hope there isn’t a power cut (laughter), but I <span class=SpellE>asure</span>
you that if there is it won’t last long, just as long as necessary, and you can
take my word for that, well, except if the world comes to an end, that’s
another matter entirely, and I hope that it doesn’t happen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I’m
sure that many ideas and memories occupy our minds; the hurricane, this one,
the other one, the one last year, the one that came after that, the one that
came this year, the one that passed close by, and those to come. None is any
match for us. A much worse and more powerful hurricane, that is also armed with
nuclear weapons, yes, because the blow that was dealt us when it hit the
country, over in the province of <span class=SpellE>Granma</span> and part of
the province of Santiago de Cuba, was very nearly, as seen from the air, the
closest thing to a nuclear explosion, without the radiation, but powerful
enough to destroy everything. It is impossible to forget the image of <span
class=SpellE>Pilón</span>, of <span class=SpellE>Cabo</span> Cruz and <span
class=SpellE>Niquero</span>. Lots of nuclear weapons, one every 10 <span
class=SpellE>kilometres</span>, we saw the after-effects over in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Hiroshima</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'> and it was terrible, but
it covered an area, a <span class=SpellE>diametre</span>, of 10 or 15 <span
class=SpellE>kilometres</span>, it destroyed everything; but a hurricane of
this speed devastates anything in its way, for hundreds of <span class=SpellE>kilometres</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>We
feared for Cárdenas, given the way it was heading, the huge range in which the
gale-force winds, as they say, were sometimes reaching up to 200 <span
class=SpellE>kilometres</span>; luckily, it was losing power, due to a big
mistake that it made, it wasn’t like the one last year that entered directly
from the Caymans, it came via the sea and passed directly through the province
of La <span class=SpellE>Habana</span> and penetrated the capital; this one
decided to enter via the very place, give or take, where the <span
class=SpellE>Girón</span> mercenaries entered, and it met with pretty much the
same fate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It
entered in that direction, and it was something that we knew very little about,
and it was coming directly towards La <span class=SpellE>Habana</span>, on its
right-hand side <span class=GramE>was</span> </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  class=SpellE><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Matanzas</span></span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>, Cárdenas and <span
class=SpellE>Varadero</span>. It wasn’t long since the other one had passed <span
class=GramE>through,</span> Michelle had passed by on its way to the south
east.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>In
five years that citrus plantation has been hit by three hurricanes, and this
one was headed the same way; but it covered around 300 <span class=SpellE>kilometres</span>,
it was losing strength; it gave its all, with even gusts of 300 <span
class=SpellE>kilometres</span> per hour, but the wind was losing momentum and
its range was diminishing and, although the wind was still strong when it
entered the province of La <span class=SpellE>Habana</span>, almost 200 <span
class=SpellE>kilometres</span>, it destroyed a much smaller area. When it
entered it was a category four and by the end it ranked as a category one;
however, it has been one of the hurricanes that has caused the most material
damage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
other one was coming from more or less the same direction, and we were
monitoring it, and while we were taking urgent measures to help those affected,
we were now preparing ourselves for the second hurricane as well, and we’re
ready. I can assure you that we can withstand them, one, two, three, and we
will perfect our mechanisms, so that, as on many other occasions, there is not
one single victim. It can destroy anything it wishes, but in the eyes of the
Revolution a human life is worth more than anything that a hurricane could ever
destroy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
hope that no-one doubts what I am saying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Afterwards
the rains came, arriving after one of the most severe droughts, or maybe even
the worst to have ever affected our country; for many months hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of people had to get their water from trucks, tankers,
tractors, at a time when the price of diesel is over 500 dollars per ton, and
petrol costs 600 dollars per ton.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Those
who don’t really stop to think about things should bear in mind that oil is not
water, diesel is not water, petrol is not water, it doesn’t fall from the sky,
it isn’t overflowing and the shortage of it is overwhelming. It is necessary to
invest large sums of money into each of these substances: They don’t fall from
the <span class=GramE>sky,</span> you have to earn them by the sweat of your
brow or with energy and intelligence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>We
still have a lot to learn, and we are going to learn, you can take my word for
that as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Today
even nature pays homage to this event; it pays homage to Cárdenas, it pays
homage to this history from which so many things have developed, from which the
Revolution regained strength; strength to wage a battle, to win it, confronted
with the haughty and immensely powerful, as powerful as it is cynical, as
powerful as it is cowardly, as powerful as it is miserable, the empire, that
was unable to sweep away this Revolution despite its winds of perhaps 1 000 <span
class=SpellE>kilometres</span>, or 10 000 per hour; it was unable to quash the
will and resistance of this heroic people. Really, heroic, and you prove this;
nobody lost heart, nobody gave in to fear. Whenever necessary this school has
risen up in arms and has marched, in front of the Interests Section, and that’s
how these marches, attended by hundreds of thousand of children, mothers,
youngsters, people, who fought non stop for month after month, happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
can assure you that we won that battle as well, I can assure you of this,
because the fighting spirit wouldn’t desist, our stance wouldn’t desist, our
peaceful but efficient weapons wouldn’t desist, our truths wouldn’t desist, our
messages to the world wouldn’t desist, and they didn’t desist. This is where
the slogan, Battle of Ideas, came from, because it was a veritable battle of
ideas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Let
us remember that one of the things that <span class=GramE>increases</span> the
triumph of those events for us and for this history of our homeland is the fact
that that is when the battle of ideas began, which will go on for a long time
and will continue to reap rewards, it will continue to defeat the enemies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It
is clear that despite all the difficulties and all the setbacks, the truth will
out, the most just ideas multiply and millions, tens of millions, hundreds of
millions are uniting on the side of truth, and this truth, or these truths will
end up crushing the empire, and not only from outside but also from inside;
because we can never forget that at the end of that battle of ideas around 80%
of Americans supported our cause, they supported our struggle, and they made
the outcome possible. But, as was said at the time, that was the first step,
and there are still many battles to be waged, that are being waged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Thank
you, then, to Mother Nature, who has cooperated in this event, there is <span
class=GramE>a freshness</span> in the air and I can see that there are lights
on, as if announcing the many lights that never go off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
was saying that, fortunately, <span class=SpellE>Cardénas</span> has been left
undamaged; <span class=SpellE>Varadero</span> has hardly been damaged; the
province’s capital has hardly been damaged, regardless of the near-on 180 000
homes affected by the hurricane, tens of thousands of which were completely
destroyed; in spite of the many thousands of warehouses and facilities of all
kinds that were affected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
can also assure you of something else: there has never been <span class=GramE>an</span>
reconstruction effort such as the one that we are embarking on now. If you
like, I’ll give you some facts and figures:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
have been told that after the passing of Michelle, around 80 000 zinc roofs
were delivered – they were delivered for the reparation <span class=SpellE>programme</span>
-, whereas two days ago 250 000 roofs were delivered. And this is only a
warm-up for the forces and resources that will be going into action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
have mentioned some of these things because they cause us unrest. I recall that
on that morning I was talking to the Party Secretary in the province: ‘Where
are you?’ He replied: ‘I’m in Cárdenas’. I asked him: ‘How’s <span
class=SpellE>Elián</span>?’ He is the symbol of Cárdenas. He said: Well, I’ve
not been able to see <span class=SpellE>Elián</span>, but I’ve been told that
he has had a fall’. ‘What, <span class=SpellE>Elián</span> has had a fall?!’ – <span
class=GramE>on</span> the 8<sup>th</sup>, in the morning. I saw him, he was
laughing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>He
said: ‘He’s had about three or four stitches’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
said: ‘How did he fall, what happened?’ The hurricane still hadn’t arrived, it
had just entered <span class=SpellE>Cienfuegos</span>, and they said: ‘No, the
thing is’- I don’t want to accuse him- ‘the other one, the one with the
brilliant smile, the one that conquered half of New York that afternoon’ – he
said – ‘he pushed him. Yes, he fell over and he’s had about three stitches’. I
said: You don’t say! We’re not going to announce now that Elian has had
stitches’. It was okay, because there’s nothing to see, no mark, it’s proof of
the quality of our doctors, isn’t it<span class=GramE>?,</span> the fact that
there’s not a scratch on him. I said: ‘Where was he injured?’ There’s nothing
to see. But he had been pushed, you know when, the morning of the 8<sup>th</sup>.
And, anyway, I asked several times later on, and he was okay. I was thinking
that the <span class=GramE>hurricane<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>was</span>
coming here or close-by.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Well,
we now know what causes the most damage. The damage caused, as we explained...,
there was talk of costs of 1 400 million, the damage is greater; but we know
how to repair damage. Money is needed, raw materials are needed, lots of
materials are needed; we will have to invest several hundred million, but not 1
400. If we have the raw material, we can put in the rest with hard work, with
the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>So,
when it is said: so much was lost, okay, nobody is going to get back the crops
that were lost at the <span class=SpellE>Jagüey</span> citrus plantation or
many other things; but with the raw material that we are going to have at our
disposal, we will produce what was lost to the hurricane, and much more
besides; what was lost to this one, and if another one comes along we’ll add it
on, and if another one comes along, three hurricanes, we’ll add them on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Another
thing I can assure you of is that with our effort and with the resources that
the country can get together, we will repair all the damage and more besides.
We’ll see, within a year, on this same date, what is going on in the country,
with or without a hurricane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>This
shows that, like ants, we can do things, and like ants we have been doing
things in many places; but also here in Cárdenas, we almost loose count: the
Marcelo <span class=SpellE>Salado</span> school is new, it bears no resemblance
to the one that we visited at the beginning; there is a splendid, beautiful new
museum, I believe it is called the Museum of the Battle of Ideas. You see, this
here, historic, with so many values; you see, there is the house that we have
just visited, where José Antonio was born, it has been reconstructed and it too
has been converted into a museum; there is the repair work underway in the
schools, there are the basic secondary schools, the advances made in the health
sector over these last five years are notable, and it’s no small thing, there’s
more, you’ll see, in important plans for this city and others. <span
class=GramE>There’s lots</span> to be done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span class=SpellE><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Varadero</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>, one of the greatest tourist resorts in the world
keeps on growing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
general <span class=GramE>teachers</span> who have emerged over the last few
years, the emergent teachers, there’s now around 15 000 of them, and many are
here in Cárdenas.... From </span><st1:City><st1:place><span class=SpellE><span

that when we visited them, when they came back, the first lot went to the
Marcelo <span class=SpellE>Salado</span> <span class=GramE>school</span>. Now
the emergent teachers are an institution and soon they’ll have university
degrees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>That’s
what the social workers are doing, there are 28 000 of them now, and those days
were just the beginning. What a huge force! I was asking the young girls and
boys who have just graduated from the sixth grade what they were going to study
and many of them said to me: ‘I’m going to the UCI (the University of
Information Science) What a brilliant institute that doesn’t stop moving
forward! The girls and boys are selected from the highest achievers from around
the country and it makes me so happy to think that many of those who I said
hello to and to whom I gave the diplomas are going to go to that prestigious
institute, a fair amount of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Others
said to me: ‘I want to be a doctor’. I said: ‘Well be prepared, because we are
going to send you on international missions’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>One
told me that he wanted to be a painter, and another said that he wanted to be
an astronomer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Another
child said: ‘I want to be a teacher’. A little girl said: ‘I want to be an
actress’. They came one by one from over there and not one of them was in any
doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Some
said: ‘Well, I still don’t know’. ‘Ah, you don’t know<span class=GramE>?,</span>
well you have to think about it. Okay, think hard about it, so that you don’t
get it wrong’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>There
I saw the mark of our people, I saw the mark of our graduates of today, of the
1 246. What did that procession mean? What did each reply mean?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
asked myself: ‘<span class=GramE>Is</span> there any other place in the world
where a graduation group of 1 246 pupils, like this one, pass by and each one
of them knows or has some idea what they want to be? Not one of them was in any
doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Let’s
think for a second, let’s go back in a time machine 50 years, let’s find
ourselves in Cárdenas, let’s ask ourselves how many pupils graduated from the
sixth grade, here and in the fields; let’s ask ourselves if it could be the
full hundred per cent, and all of sixth grade age, without <span class=SpellE>developmnt</span>
problems, and all with excellent knowledge, convinced as we are that it will be
greater, and that each one of them came with their parents, bursting with pride
and satisfaction, because those who are here are not those who were the owners
of <span class=SpellE>Varadero</span>, of hotels, of large estates; no, those
who are here today are from humble <span class=SpellE>famillies</span> whose
parents could not aspire to get a university degree. How many graduated from
the sixth grade, and how many from the ninth <span class=GramE>grade,</span>
and how many from graduated from high school, and how many could attend the
only university that was so far away?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Yes,
I know one, Doctor Selman, his father was a tailor, and I believe that as a
tailor he was able to earn a decent wage, he moved over there so that his son
could study at the university.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
am one of those who was privileged enough to be able to study and I am only too
aware of the reason why, because I was not the son of an agricultural worker or
of a cane cutter or of a cattle hand or of anyone who did any kind of <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> like that. This was the chance that befell me, I
wasn’t to blame by any means, and I am glad that I made the most of the <span
class=GramE>situation, that</span> I was lucky enough to be able to study, and
therefore, go to university, when there was just the one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Who
knows how many professionals there are among the mothers and fathers of the
children who graduate here today, teachers, health workers, technical workers,
and each and every one of them knows that in this country their children can
study whatever they wish: from specialist in the highest level of computing and
information sciences to cosmonaut, astronomer able to <span class=SpellE>scrutinise</span>
the mysteries of the universe, of that infinity of stars that we see at night
that are hundreds of light years away, thousands of light years away, light
that travels at a speed of 300 000 <span class=SpellE>kilometres</span> per
second, here from this little corner of the Earth, from this world, from this
little planet in crisis, whose species is being threatened by the voracity and
barbarity, the ignorance and stupidity of those who wield great power, the
irresponsibleness of those who plunder the world and today can’t even save it
from destruction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Our
concern for the future of these children who are graduating here, those who
have still not reached first grade, Elian’s little brothers and sisters, is and
always will be very great. What does the future hold for them in this world in
which the environment is being destroyed? What can we do to save them from the
brutes, the imbeciles, the cretins? And some people will ask themselves why I
use such strong words. But suffice it to say that the sun is setting over here
and it rises here, if you look to the North you’ll see the most incredible
brutality and crimes against the world that have never before been committed in
the history of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>There
are some very important things that concern us when we raise our eyes and try
to look to tomorrow. What will happen to these children? We may have a hand in
the cruel fate that awaits them if this battle of ideas isn’t won, this battle
that is today being waged worldwide in the name of the survival of the species.
Today we see what we dream of for them, what we wish for <span class=SpellE>for</span>
our people, that every child is born, as I have said on other occasions,
anointed; because we receive many students for all over who study medicine, who
study something else, who have the chance to take their high school diploma
even though they’re from humble origins, not in the best school, because you
all know that the best schools are for the rich people in the world, except in
the country that has experienced a revolution like ours. They do have the
chance to come and study and receive a degree in medicine, they feel that they
have been sent a gift from heaven, that they have been given the most extraordinary
news: The possibility to come and study this noble profession in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>So,
there are, for example, 10 000 medical students from other countries here, and
many thousands more will come. Our country will become a producer of medical
specialists in the world, and we will do it because we can and because the
world needs it, hundreds of millions of human beings in </span><st1:place><span

as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>They
study, they spend 7 years here in order to graduate with a degree in medicine, they
are excellent; some of them are now going back and what magnificent
professionals they have become.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>To
compare their situation with that of the children of these countries, the few
who do graduate from the sixth grade, because there is 15%, 20%, 30% illiteracy;
only a handful of children make it to the sixth grade in many of these
countries and in others the percentage is higher. In </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'> itself, many children
didn’t used to reach sixth grade, but thanks to the extraordinary educational
revolution that is taking place over there, children are now graduating en
masse as they do here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
remember those first years of our revolution, so many pupils were behind, so
many unqualified teachers, worthy people doing what they could, because thanks
to them we set out on the road that led us to what we have today; but there
wasn’t one of those children nor is there one among the 1 246 who are
graduating, and the parents here know it, that they cannot speak with
exactness, like the children who passed by here, one by one; I am going to
study this, the other thing, the other thing, or I’m going to think about it, I
still haven’t decided. But I ask you: Is there one of you who could raise your
hand, just one of the parents of the 1 246, who could say that their child does
not have the right to decide to study what he or she wishes? From astronomy, I
repeat, to a doctor’s degree in medical sciences, in philosophical sciences, or
future dancers who make stages tremble worldwide, like those here at this
school, represented by theses primary pupils of art school, even, or those
scattered around the provinces of the country, teaching dance, music, painting,
or any similar manifestation, today within the reach of these children, because
they know that they can say: I want to be this, and they will be, with the
exception of those careers which require this or that vocation, and everyone
has their vocation, for one thing or another. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Is
there, by any chance, one of you who could raise your hand, mothers and
fathers? Because you know that, even you mothers and fathers that, due to some
kind of accident, are the parents of a child with some type of disability, or
whom have been limited by an act of nature, you know that there are places in
schools for more than 50 000 children suffering from these problems. I also ask
myself: is there any child who has been forgotten, abandoned? There may be, but
nowadays it is very unlikely that our social workers won’t find him or her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Sometimes
the ignorance in some far-off corner of the country is such that people don’t
know that there is a social security service or that it is possible to receive
the care needed; but, in fact, there is a team that finds these people, weighs
them, measures their frame to check that they are of the right weight and size
for their age group: these are the social workers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
have devoted some time to pointing this out, because it needs to be thought
about, reflected upon. Those who have nothing to show in this world, except
poverty and pain, exploitation, plundering, abuse and crime, try to use lies to
confuse. And these people must be asked whether there is any other place on
Earth where what is being <span class=SpellE>affrmed</span> here can be also be
affirmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>People
don’t <span class=SpellE>realise</span> the power of the truth. One of the
greatest secrets, maybe the most important secret, of this Revolution is that
it deals in the truth, and the truth is invincible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Maybe
I used this time well, since there was almost more than enough, in which to
share some inspired thoughts with you, an <span class=SpellE>unfogettable</span>
memory of all those children and the words that I exchanged with them. Anything
else: What personality! Sixth grade, I saw them walk past, one by one, the
girls were in the clear majority. The boys had their personalities, but the
girls; what personality! This is a rare thing <span class=GramE>elsewhere,</span>
this is the fruit of a different world, of a different society, quite a lot of
equals in among the inequalities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>You
know that those who create inequalities here are, for the most part, the crafty
and the greedy, who as soon as the chance arises, put their hand in people’s
pockets and take away their salary, even just to get them in a van and charge
them 100 pesos to take them to Havana or wherever. We know about all of these
things, <span class=GramE>don’t</span> anybody think that we don’t. And we are
happy in the knowledge that all of these things are being put to an end, and
not with the use of violence, they are being stopped through the process of
enhancing what we <span class=SpellE>hace</span> <span class=SpellE>acheived</span>,
through enhancing our society. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind, I assure
you, and it won’t be the job of a group of men, it will be the job of everyone;
all of you and all of your children will lead this fight. Because some people
say: this is wrong. Ah<span class=GramE>!,</span> but they don’t <span
class=SpellE>criticise</span> those who do it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
read people’s opinions on all the good things and all the bad things; but I’m
not going to go into that here, there is a lot I have to say on the matter, but
I don’t want to talk about it today, I just want to tell you that we have a lot
to think about, a lot to reflect upon and we must fight together; the defects
that are still with us, the bad habits that we still have can only be overcome
if we all join forces. And our forces shall join together!; because truth,
nobility, honesty, the greatest qualities that a human being is capable of, can
work miracles, they can make possible what for millennia, in fact, seemed
impossible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
